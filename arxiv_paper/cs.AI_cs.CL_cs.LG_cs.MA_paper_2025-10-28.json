        "summary": "The rapid advancements in large foundation models and multi-agent systems offer unprecedented capabilities, yet current Human-in-the-Loop (HiTL) paradigms inadequately integrate human expertise, often leading to cognitive overload and decision-making bottlenecks in complex, high-stakes environments. We propose the \"Human-Machine Social Hybrid Intelligence\" (HMS-HI) framework, a novel architecture designed for deep, collaborative decision-making between groups of human experts and LLM-powered AI agents. HMS-HI is built upon three core pillars: (1) a \\textbf{Shared Cognitive Space (SCS)} for unified, multi-modal situational awareness and structured world modeling; (2) a \\textbf{Dynamic Role and Task Allocation (DRTA)} module that adaptively assigns tasks to the most suitable agent (human or AI) based on capabilities and workload; and (3) a \\textbf{Cross-Species Trust Calibration (CSTC)} protocol that fosters transparency, accountability, and mutual adaptation through explainable declarations and structured feedback. Validated in a high-fidelity urban emergency response simulation, HMS-HI significantly reduced civilian casualties by 72\\% and cognitive load by 70\\% compared to traditional HiTL approaches, demonstrating superior decision quality, efficiency, and human-AI trust. An ablation study confirms the critical contribution of each module, highlighting that engineered trust and shared context are foundational for scalable, synergistic human-AI collaboration.",

        "summary": "Autonomous drone technology holds significant promise for enhancing search and rescue operations during evacuations by guiding humans toward safety and supporting broader emergency response efforts. However, their application in dynamic, real-time evacuation support remains limited. Existing models often overlook the psychological and emotional complexity of human behavior under extreme stress. In real-world fire scenarios, evacuees frequently deviate from designated safe routes due to panic and uncertainty. To address these challenges, this paper presents a multi-agent coordination framework in which autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) assist human evacuees in real-time by locating, intercepting, and guiding them to safety under uncertain conditions. We model the problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), where two heterogeneous UAV agents, a high-level rescuer (HLR) and a low-level rescuer (LLR), coordinate through shared observations and complementary capabilities. Human behavior is captured using an agent-based model grounded in empirical psychology, where panic dynamically affects decision-making and movement in response to environmental stimuli. The environment features stochastic fire spread, unknown evacuee locations, and limited visibility, requiring UAVs to plan over long horizons to search for humans and adapt in real-time. Our framework employs the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm with recurrent policies to enable robust decision-making in partially observable settings. Simulation results demonstrate that the UAV team can rapidly locate and intercept evacuees, significantly reducing the time required for them to reach safety compared to scenarios without UAV assistance.",

Given a set of options (temporally abstract actions) available to each agent, we convert the task specification into the corresponding Buchi Automaton and proceed with a model-free approach which collects transition samples and constructs a product Semi Markov Decision Process (SMDP) on-the-fly. Value-based Reinforcement Learning algorithms can then be used to synthesize a correct-by-design controller without learning the underlying transition model of the multi-agent system. The exponential sample complexity due to multiple agents is dealt with using a novel reward shaping approach. We test the proposed algorithm in a deterministic gridworld simulation for different tasks and find that the reward shaping results in significant reduction in convergence times. We also infer that using options becomes increasing more relevant as the state and action space increases in multi-agent systems.",

        "summary": "In the context of Federated Learning with heterogeneous data environments, local models tend to converge to their own local model optima during local training steps, deviating from the overall data distributions. Aggregation of these local updates, e.g., with FedAvg, often does not align with the global model optimum (client drift), resulting in an update that is suboptimal for most clients. Personalized Federated Learning approaches address this challenge by exclusively focusing on the average local performances of clients' models on their own data distribution. Generalization to out-of-distribution samples, which is a substantial benefit of FedAvg and represents a significant component of robustness, appears to be inadequately incorporated into the assessment and evaluation processes. This study involves a thorough evaluation of Federated Learning approaches, encompassing both their local performance and their generalization capabilities. Therefore, we examine different stages within a single communication round to enable a more nuanced understanding of the considered metrics. Furthermore, we propose and incorporate a modified approach of FedAvg, designated as Federated Learning with Individualized Updates (FLIU), extending the algorithm by a straightforward individualization step with an adaptive personalization factor. We evaluate and compare the approaches empirically using MNIST and CIFAR-10 under various distributional conditions, including benchmark IID and pathological non-IID, as well as additional novel test environments with Dirichlet distribution specifically developed to stress the algorithms on complex data heterogeneity.",

        "summary": "The autonomy of software agents is fundamentally dependent on their ability to construct an actionable internal world model from the structured data that defines their digital environment, such as the Document Object Model (DOM) of web pages and the semantic descriptions of web services. However, constructing this world model from raw structured data presents two critical challenges: the verbosity of raw HTML makes it computationally intractable for direct use by foundation models, while the static nature of hardcoded API integrations prevents agents from adapting to evolving services. This paper introduces a pattern language for world modeling from structured data, presenting two complementary architectural patterns. The DOM Transduction Pattern addresses the challenge of web page complexity by distilling} a verbose, raw DOM into a compact, task-relevant representation or world model optimized for an agent's reasoning core. Concurrently, the Hypermedia Affordances Recognition Pattern enables the agent to dynamically enrich its world model by parsing standardized semantic descriptions to discover and integrate the capabilities of unknown web services at runtime. Together, these patterns provide a robust framework for engineering agents that can efficiently construct and maintain an accurate world model, enabling scalable, adaptive, and interoperable automation across the web and its extended resources.",

Large Language Models (LLMs), with their world knowledge and role-playing capabilities, are strong candidates to serve as the foundation for legal society simulation. However, the application of LLMs to simulate legal systems remains underexplored. In this work, we introduce Law in Silico, an LLM-based agent framework for simulating legal scenarios with individual decision-making and institutional mechanisms of legislation, adjudication, and enforcement. Our experiments, which compare simulated crime rates with real-world data, demonstrate that LLM-based agents can largely reproduce macro-level crime trends and provide insights that align with real-world observations. At the same time, micro-level simulations reveal that a well-functioning, transparent, and adaptive legal system offers better protection of the rights of vulnerable individuals.",

        "summary": "We introduce TDFlow, a novel test-driven agentic workflow that frames repository-scale software engineering as a test-resolution task, specifically designed to solve human-written tests. Given a set of tests, TDFlow repeatedly proposes, revises, and debugs repository-scale patches using precisely engineered sub-agents and tightly constrained tools. The workflow decomposes software engineering program repair into four components governed by respective sub-agents. This simple, forced decoupling of patch proposing, debugging, patch revision, and optional test generation (1) reduces long-context burden on any individual sub-agent, (2) focuses each sub-agent on specific, pre-defined sub-tasks, and (3) allows for specialized performance improvement on specific sub-tasks. When provided human-written tests, TDFlow attains 88.8% pass rate on SWE-Bench Lite (an absolute improvement of 27.8% over the next best system) and 94.3% on SWE-Bench Verified. Manual inspection of the 800 TDFlow runs within SWE-Bench Lite and Verified uncover only 7 instances of test hacking, which were subsequently counted as failures. Furthermore, we show that the primary obstacle to human-level software engineering performance lies within writing successful reproduction tests. We envision a human-LLM interactive system powered by TDFlow where human developers write tests solved by LLM systems. Together, these results indicate that modern LLMs, when embedded in a narrowly engineered, test-driven workflow, already achieve human-level test resolution -- with the final frontier for fully autonomous repository repair being the accurate generation of valid reproduction tests.",

We demonstrate that MetricX-25, adapting Gemma 3 to an encoder-only architecture with a regression head on top, can be trained to effectively predict both MQM and ESA quality scores, and significantly outperforms its predecessor. Our decoder-only GemSpanEval model, on the other hand, we show to be competitive in error span detection with xCOMET, a strong encoder-only sequence-tagging baseline. With error span detection formulated as a generative task, we instruct the model to also output the context for each predicted error span, thus ensuring that error spans are identified unambiguously.",

This paper introduces a benchmark, ComboBench, evaluating LLMs' capability to translate semantic actions into VR device manipulation sequences across 262 scenarios from four popular VR games: Half-Life: Alyx, Into the Radius, Moss: Book II, and Vivecraft. We evaluate seven LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini-1.5-Pro, LLaMA-3-8B, Mixtral-8x7B, and GLM-4-Flash, compared against annotated ground truth and human performance. Our results reveal that while top-performing models like Gemini-1.5-Pro demonstrate strong task decomposition capabilities, they still struggle with procedural reasoning and spatial understanding compared to humans. Performance varies significantly across games, suggesting sensitivity to interaction complexity. Few-shot examples substantially improve performance, indicating potential for targeted enhancement of LLMs' VR manipulation capabilities.

In this work, we argue that the bottleneck is not a lack of underlying data sources, but that a large variety of data is fragmented across heterogeneous formats, tools, and interfaces. To this end, we introduce the agent data protocol (ADP), a light-weight representation language that serves as an \"interlingua\" between agent datasets in diverse formats and unified agent training pipelines downstream. The design of ADP is expressive enough to capture a large variety of tasks, including API/tool use, browsing, coding, software engineering, and general agentic workflows, while remaining simple to parse and train on without engineering at a per-dataset level. In experiments, we unified a broad collection of 13 existing agent training datasets into ADP format, and converted the standardized ADP data into training-ready formats for multiple agent frameworks. We performed SFT on these data, and demonstrated an average performance gain of ~20% over corresponding base models, and delivers state-of-the-art or near-SOTA performance on standard coding, browsing, tool use, and research benchmarks, without domain-specific tuning. All code and data are released publicly, in the hope that ADP could help lower the barrier to standardized, scalable, and reproducible agent training.",

        "summary": "LLM-based web agents show immense promise for information seeking, yet their effectiveness on long-horizon tasks is hindered by a fundamental trade-off in context management. Prevailing ReAct-based agents suffer from context saturation as they accumulate noisy, raw histories, while methods that fixedly summarize the full history at each step risk the irreversible loss of critical details. Addressing these, we introduce AgentFold, a novel agent paradigm centered on proactive context management, inspired by the human cognitive process of retrospective consolidation. AgentFold treats its context as a dynamic cognitive workspace to be actively sculpted, rather than a passive log to be filled. At each step, it learns to execute a `folding' operation, which manages its historical trajectory at multiple scales: it can perform granular condensations to preserve vital, fine-grained details, or deep consolidations to abstract away entire multi-step sub-tasks. The results on prominent benchmarks are striking: with simple supervised fine-tuning (without continual pre-training or RL), our AgentFold-30B-A3B agent achieves 36.2% on BrowseComp and 47.3% on BrowseComp-ZH. Notably, this performance not only surpasses or matches open-source models of a dramatically larger scale, such as the DeepSeek-V3.1-671B-A37B, but also surpasses leading proprietary agents like OpenAI's o4-mini.",

To address these issues, we propose ParallelMuse, a two-stage paradigm designed for deep IS agents. The first stage, Functionality-Specified Partial Rollout, partitions generated sequences into functional regions and performs uncertainty-guided path reuse and branching to enhance exploration efficiency. The second stage, Compressed Reasoning Aggregation, exploits reasoning redundancy to losslessly compress information relevant to answer derivation and synthesize a coherent final answer.

        "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a transformative approach for open-ended problem solving, with information seeking (IS) being a core capability that enables autonomous reasoning and decision-making. While prior research has largely focused on improving retrieval depth, we observe that current IS agents often suffer from low search efficiency, which in turn constrains overall performance. A key factor underlying this inefficiency is the sparsity of target entities in training tasks, which limits opportunities for agents to learn and generalize efficient search behaviors. To address these challenges, we propose WebLeaper, a framework for constructing high-coverage IS tasks and generating efficient solution trajectories. We formulate IS as a tree-structured reasoning problem, enabling a substantially larger set of target entities to be embedded within a constrained context. Leveraging curated Wikipedia tables, we propose three variants for synthesizing IS tasks, Basic, Union, and Reverse-Union, to systematically increase both IS efficiency and efficacy. Finally, we curate training trajectories by retaining only those that are simultaneously accurate and efficient, ensuring that the model is optimized for both correctness and search performance. Extensive experiments on both basic and comprehensive settings, conducted on five IS benchmarks, BrowserComp, GAIA, xbench-DeepSearch, WideSearch, and Seal-0, demonstrate that our method consistently achieves improvements in both effectiveness and efficiency over strong baselines.",

We introduce a data synthesis approach inspired by the educational theory of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), which defines this frontier as tasks an LLM cannot solve alone but can master with guidance. To operationalize this, we present the AgentFrontier Engine, an automated pipeline that synthesizes high-quality, multidisciplinary data situated precisely within the LLM's ZPD. This engine supports both continued pre-training with knowledge-intensive data and targeted post-training on complex reasoning tasks. From the same framework, we derive the ZPD Exam, a dynamic and automated benchmark designed to evaluate agent capabilities on these frontier tasks. We train AgentFrontier-30B-A3B model on our synthesized data, which achieves state-of-the-art results on demanding benchmarks like Humanity's Last Exam, even surpassing some leading proprietary agents. Our work demonstrates that a ZPD-guided approach to data synthesis offers a scalable and effective path toward building more capable LLM agents.",

        "summary": "LLM-based search agents are increasingly trained on entity-centric synthetic data to solve complex, knowledge-intensive tasks. However, prevailing training methods like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) discard this rich entity information, relying instead on sparse, outcome-based rewards. This critical limitation renders them unable to distinguish informative \"near-miss\" samples-those with substantially correct reasoning but a flawed final answer-from complete failures, thus discarding valuable learning signals. We address this by leveraging the very entities discarded during training. Our empirical analysis reveals a strong positive correlation between the number of ground-truth entities identified during an agent's reasoning process and final answer accuracy. Building on this insight, we introduce Entity-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (E-GRPO), a novel framework that formulates a dense entity-aware reward function. E-GRPO assigns partial rewards to incorrect samples proportional to their entity match rate, enabling the model to effectively learn from these \"near-misses\". Experiments on diverse question-answering (QA) and deep research benchmarks show that E-GRPO consistently and significantly outperforms the GRPO baseline. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that E-GRPO not only achieves superior accuracy but also induces more efficient reasoning policies that require fewer tool calls, demonstrating a more effective and sample-efficient approach to aligning search agents.",

Unlike existing ungrounded self-play methods that offer more limited benefits, SPICE achieves consistent gains across mathematical (+8.9%) and general reasoning (+9.8%) benchmarks on multiple model families.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have gained significant traction in medical decision support systems, particularly in the context of medical question answering and role-playing simulations. A common practice, Prompt-Based Role Playing (PBRP), instructs models to adopt different clinical roles (e.g., medical students, residents, attending physicians) to simulate varied professional behaviors. However, the impact of such role prompts on model reasoning capabilities remains unclear. This study introduces the RP-Neuron-Activated Evaluation Framework(RPNA) to evaluate whether role prompts induce distinct, role-specific cognitive processes in LLMs or merely modify linguistic style. We test this framework on three medical QA datasets, employing neuron ablation and representation analysis techniques to assess changes in reasoning pathways. Our results demonstrate that role prompts do not significantly enhance the medical reasoning abilities of LLMs. Instead, they primarily affect surface-level linguistic features, with no evidence of distinct reasoning pathways or cognitive differentiation across clinical roles. Despite superficial stylistic changes, the core decision-making mechanisms of LLMs remain uniform across roles, indicating that current PBRP methods fail to replicate the cognitive complexity found in real-world medical practice. This highlights the limitations of role-playing in medical AI and emphasizes the need for models that simulate genuine cognitive processes rather than linguistic imitation.We have released the related code in the following repository:https: //github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/RolePlay_LLMDoctor",

        "summary": "Language agents have demonstrated remarkable potential in web search and information retrieval. However, these search agents assume user queries are complete and unambiguous, an assumption that diverges from reality where users begin with incomplete queries requiring clarification through interaction. Yet most agents lack interactive mechanisms during the search process, and existing benchmarks cannot assess this capability. To address this gap, we introduce InteractComp, a benchmark designed to evaluate whether search agents can recognize query ambiguity and actively interact to resolve it during search. Following the principle of easy to verify, interact to disambiguate, we construct 210 expert-curated questions across 9 domains through a target-distractor methodology that creates genuine ambiguity resolvable only through interaction. Evaluation of 17 models reveals striking failure: the best model achieves only 13.73% accuracy despite 71.50% with complete context, exposing systematic overconfidence rather than reasoning deficits. Forced interaction produces dramatic gains, demonstrating latent capability current strategies fail to engage. Longitudinal analysis shows interaction capabilities stagnated over 15 months while search performance improved seven-fold, revealing a critical blind spot. This stagnation, coupled with the immediate feedback inherent to search tasks, makes InteractComp a valuable resource for both evaluating and training interaction capabilities in search agents.

Unlike instruction-tuned models trained on static case summaries, our method acquires diagnostic strategies through interactive exploration and outcome-based feedback. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) We present DiagGym, a diagnostics world model trained with electronic health records that emits examination outcomes conditioned on patient history and recommended examination, serving as a virtual clinical environment for realistic diagnosis training and evaluation; (ii) We train DiagAgent via end-to-end, multi-turn reinforcement learning to learn diagnostic policies that optimize both information yield and diagnostic accuracy; (iii) We introduce DiagBench, a diagnostic benchmark comprising 750 cases with physician-validated examination recommendations and 99 cases annotated with 973 physician-written rubrics on diagnosis process; (iv) we demonstrate superior performance across diverse diagnostic settings. DiagAgent significantly outperforms 10 state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-v3 and GPT-4o, as well as two prompt-engineered agents. In single-turn settings, DiagAgent achieves 9.34% higher diagnostic accuracy and 44.03% improvement in examination recommendation hit ratio. In end-to-end settings, it delivers 15.12% increase in diagnostic accuracy and 23.09% boost in examination recommendation F1 score. In rubric-based evaluation, it surpasses the next-best model, Claude-sonnet-4, by 7.1% in weighted rubric score.

Unlike prior approaches that rely on annotated or synthetic data for supervised fine-tuning, R3 enables the retriever to dynamically explore and optimize relevance within the RAG environment. During training, the retrieved results interact with the environment to produce contrastive signals that automatically guide the retriever's self-improvement. Extensive experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate that R3 improves RAG performance by 5.2% over the original retriever and surpasses state-of-the-art retrievers by 4.9%, while achieving comparable results to LLM-augmented retrieval and RAG systems built on post-trained or instruction-tuned LLMs. It is both efficient and practical, requiring only 4 GPUs and completing training within a single day.",

We find that all three features robustly change reading times in both typical and dyslexic readers, and that dyslexic readers show stronger sensitivities to each, especially predictability. Counterfactual manipulations of these features substantially narrow the dyslexic-control gap by about one third, with predictability showing the strongest effect, followed by length and frequency. These patterns align with dyslexia theories that posit heightened demands on linguistic working memory and phonological encoding, and they motivate further work on lexical complexity and parafoveal preview benefits to explain the remaining gap. In short, we quantify when extra dyslexic costs arise, how large they are, and offer actionable guidance for interventions and computational models for dyslexics.",

However, existing RMs struggle on knowledge-intensive and long-form tasks, where evaluating correctness requires grounding beyond the model's internal knowledge. This limitation hinders them from reliably discriminating subtle quality differences, especially when external evidence is necessary. To address this, we introduce OpenRM, a tool-augmented long-form reward model that systematically judges open-ended responses by invoking external tools to gather relevant evidence. We train OpenRM with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) on over 27K synthesized pairwise examples generated through a controllable data synthesis framework. The training objective jointly supervises intermediate tool usage and final outcome accuracy, incentivizing our reward model to learn effective evidence-based judgment strategies. Extensive experiments on three newly-collected datasets and two widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that OpenRM substantially outperforms existing reward modeling approaches. As a further step, we integrate OpenRM into both inference-time response selection and training-time data selection. This yields consistent gains in downstream LLM alignment tasks, highlighting the potential of tool-augmented reward models for scaling reliable long-form evaluation.",

Using 255 decoder-only Transformers trained under matched-compute (IsoFLOP) budgets from $10^{18}$--$10^{20}$ FLOPs on standard pretraining datasets, we find diverse trajectories: academic domains on MMLU converge toward parity; regional English dialects shift depending on population size; and clusters of AI risk behaviours split, with capability- and influence-related risks increasing during pretraining while adversarial risks do not. These results show that although scaling improves overall performance, it is not a universal equalizer. To support further study, we release all model checkpoints from this work to enable practitioners to measure relative alongside traditional scaling laws, in order to better prioritize robustness challenges in light of the bitter lesson.",

We present a comprehensive study of three prefix-based methods for zero-shot cross-lingual transfer from English to 35+ high- and low-resource languages. Our analysis further explores transfer across linguistic families and scripts, as well as the impact of scaling model sizes from 1B to 24B. With Llama 3.1 8B, prefix methods outperform LoRA-baselines by up to 6% on the Belebele benchmark. Similar improvements were observed with Mistral v0.3 7B as well.

Existing static sparse methods such as sliding windows or global tokens utilizes the sparsity of attention to reduce the cost of attention, but poorly adapts to the content-dependent variations in attention due to their staticity. While previous work has proposed several dynamic approaches to improve flexibility, they still depend on predefined templates or heuristic mechanisms. Such strategies reduce generality and prune tokens that remain contextually important, limiting their accuracy across diverse tasks. To tackle these bottlenecks of existing methods for long-context modeling, we introduce Dynamic Hierarchical Sparse Attention (DHSA), a data-driven framework that dynamically predicts attention sparsity online without retraining. Our proposed DHSA adaptively segments sequences into variable-length chunks, then computes chunk representations by aggregating the token embeddings within each chunk. To avoid the bias introduced by varying chunk lengths, we apply length-normalized aggregation that scales the averaged embeddings by the square root of the chunk size. Finally, DHSA upsamples the chunk-level similarity scores to token level similarities to calculate importance scores that determine which token-level interactions should be preserved. Our experiments on Gemma2 with Needle-in-a-Haystack Test and LongBench show that DHSA matches dense attention in accuracy, while reducing prefill latency by 20-60% and peak memory usage by 35%. Compared to other representative baselines such as block sparse attention, DHSA achieves consistently higher accuracy (6-18% relative gains) with comparable or lower cost, offering an efficient and adaptable solution for long-context on-device LLMs.",

However, current dLLMs suffer from fixed generation lengths, which indicates the generation lengths of dLLMs have to be determined before decoding as a hyper-parameter, leading to issues in efficiency and flexibility. To solve these problems, in this work, we propose to train a diffusion LLM with native variable generation lengths, abbreviated as dLLM-Var. Concretely, we aim to train a model to accurately predict the [EOS] token in the generated text, which makes a dLLM be able to natively infer in a block diffusion manner, while still maintaining the ability of global bi-directional (full) attention and high parallelism. Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a 30.1x speedup over traditional dLLM inference paradigms and a 2.4x speedup relative to autoregressive models such as Qwen and Llama. Our method achieves higher accuracy and faster inference, elevating dLLMs beyond mere academic novelty and supporting their practical use in real-world applications. Codes and models have been released.",

        "summary": "Autoformalization, which translates natural language mathematics into machine-verifiable formal statements, is critical for using formal mathematical reasoning to solve math problems stated in natural language. While Large Language Models can generate syntactically correct formal statements, they often fail to preserve the original problem's semantic intent. This limitation arises from the LLM approaches' treating autoformalization as a simplistic translation task which lacks mechanisms for self-reflection and iterative refinement that human experts naturally employ. To address these issues, we propose ReForm, a Reflective Autoformalization method that tightly integrates semantic consistency evaluation into the autoformalization process. This enables the model to iteratively generate formal statements, assess its semantic fidelity, and self-correct identified errors through progressive refinement. To effectively train this reflective model, we introduce Prospective Bounded Sequence Optimization (PBSO), which employs different rewards at different sequence positions to ensure that the model develops both accurate autoformalization and correct semantic validations, preventing superficial critiques that would undermine the purpose of reflection. Extensive experiments across four autoformalization benchmarks demonstrate that ReForm achieves an average improvement of 17.2 percentage points over the strongest baselines. To further ensure evaluation reliability, we introduce ConsistencyCheck, a benchmark of 859 expert-annotated items that not only validates LLMs as judges but also reveals that autoformalization is inherently difficult: even human experts produce semantic errors in up to 38.5% of cases.",

        "summary": "Frontier AI agents show increasing promise as scientific research assistants, and may eventually be useful for extended, open-ended research workflows. However, in order to use agents for novel research, we must first assess the underlying faithfulness and correctness of their work. To evaluate agents as research assistants, we introduce ReplicationBench, an evaluation framework that tests whether agents can replicate entire research papers drawn from the astrophysics literature. Astrophysics, where research relies heavily on archival data and computational study while requiring little real-world experimentation, is a particularly useful testbed for AI agents in scientific research. We split each paper into tasks which require agents to replicate the paper's core contributions, including the experimental setup, derivations, data analysis, and codebase. Each task is co-developed with the original paper authors and targets a key scientific result, enabling objective evaluation of both faithfulness (adherence to original methods) and correctness (technical accuracy of results). ReplicationBench is extremely challenging for current frontier language models: even the best-performing language models score under 20%. We analyze ReplicationBench trajectories in collaboration with domain experts and find a rich, diverse set of failure modes for agents in scientific research. ReplicationBench establishes the first benchmark of paper-scale, expert-validated astrophysics research tasks, reveals insights about agent performance generalizable to other domains of data-driven science, and provides a scalable framework for measuring AI agents' reliability in scientific research.",

Our experiments focus on the ATCO2 corpus from the challenging Air Traffic Control (ATC) communications domain, characterized by non-native speech, noise, and specialized phraseology. Using about 5,000 hours of untranscribed speech for BEARD and 2 hours of transcribed speech for fine-tuning, the proposed approach significantly outperforms previous baseline and fine-tuned model, achieving a relative improvement of 12% compared to the fine-tuned model.

However, this linguistic evolution has remained largely unexplored in NLP due to a lack of accessible historical corpora. To address this gap, we introduce the Open Korean Historical Corpus, a large-scale, openly licensed dataset spanning 1,300 years and 6 languages, as well as under-represented writing systems like Korean-style Sinitic (Idu) and Hanja-Hangul mixed script. This corpus contains 18 million documents and 5 billion tokens from 19 sources, ranging from the 7th century to 2025. We leverage this resource to quantitatively analyze major linguistic shifts: (1) Idu usage peaked in the 1860s before declining sharply; (2) the transition from Hanja to Hangul was a rapid transformation starting around 1890; and (3) North Korea's lexical divergence causes modern tokenizers to produce up to 51 times higher out-of-vocabulary rates. This work provides a foundational resource for quantitative diachronic analysis by capturing the history of the Korean language. Moreover, it can serve as a pre-training corpus for large language models, potentially improving their understanding of Sino-Korean vocabulary in modern Hangul as well as archaic writing systems.",

        "summary": "Many words are ambiguous in terms of their part of speech (POS). However, when a word appears in a text, this ambiguity is generally much reduced. Disambiguating POS involves using context to reduce the number of POS associated with words, and is one of the main challenges of lexical tagging. The problem of labeling words by POS frequently arises in natural language processing, for example for spelling correction, grammar or style checking, expression recognition, text-to-speech conversion, text corpus analysis, etc. Lexical tagging systems are thus useful as an initial component of many natural language processing systems. A number of recent lexical tagging systems produce multiple solutions when the text is lexically ambiguous or the uniquely correct solution cannot be found. These contributions aim to guarantee a zero silence rate: the correct tag(s) for a word must never be discarded. This objective is unrealistic for systems that tag each word uniquely. This article concerns a lexical disambiguation method adapted to the objective of a zero silence rate and implemented in Silberztein's INTEX system (1993). We present here a formal description of this method. We show that to verify a local disambiguation grammar in this framework, it is not sufficient to consider the transducer paths separately: one needs to verify their interactions. Similarly, if a combination of multiple transducers is used, the result cannot be predicted by considering them in isolation. Furthermore, when examining the initial labeling of a text as produced by INTEX, ideas for disambiguation rules come spontaneously, but grammatical intuitions may turn out to be inaccurate, often due to an unforeseen construction or ambiguity. If a zero silence rate is targeted, local grammars must be carefully tested. This is where a detailed specification of what a grammar will do once applied to texts would be necessary.",

Traditional methods that mimic reference confidence expressions often fail to capture the reasoning needed for accurate confidence assessment. We propose natural language critiques as a solution, ideally suited for confidence calibration, as precise gold confidence labels are hard to obtain and often require multiple generations. This paper studies how natural language critiques can enhance verbalized confidence, addressing: (1) What to critique: uncertainty (question-focused) or confidence (answer-specific)? Analysis shows confidence suits multiple-choice tasks, while uncertainty excels in open-ended scenarios. (2) How to critique: self-critique or critique calibration training? We propose Self-Critique, enabling LLMs to critique and optimize their confidence beyond mere accuracy, and CritiCal, a novel Critique Calibration training method that leverages natural language critiques to improve confidence calibration, moving beyond direct numerical optimization. Experiments show that CritiCal significantly outperforms Self-Critique and other competitive baselines, even surpassing its teacher model, GPT-4o, in complex reasoning tasks. CritiCal also shows robust generalization in out-of-distribution settings, advancing LLM's reliability.",

Detecting and evaluating these biases can be challenging because they are often implicit rather than explicit in nature, so developing evaluation methods that assess the implicit knowledge representations of LLMs is essential. We present a novel word association network methodology for evaluating implicit biases in LLMs based on simulating semantic priming within LLM-generated word association networks. Our prompt-based approach taps into the implicit relational structures encoded in LLMs, providing both quantitative and qualitative assessments of bias. Unlike most prompt-based evaluation methods, our method enables direct comparisons between various LLMs and humans, providing a valuable point of reference and offering new insights into the alignment of LLMs with human cognition. To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we apply it to both humans and several widely used LLMs to investigate social biases related to gender, religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, and political party. Our results reveal both convergences and divergences between LLM and human biases, providing new perspectives on the potential risks of using LLMs. Our methodology contributes to a systematic, scalable, and generalizable framework for evaluating and comparing biases across multiple LLMs and humans, advancing the goal of transparent and socially responsible language technologies.",

We present PerFine, a unified, training-free critique-refine framework that enhances personalization through iterative, profile-grounded feedback. In each iteration, an LLM generator produces a draft conditioned on the retrieved profile, and a critic LLM - also conditioned on the same profile - provides structured feedback on tone, vocabulary, sentence structure, and topicality. The generator then revises, while a novel knockout strategy retains the stronger draft across iterations. We further study additional inference-time strategies such as Best-of-N and Topic Extraction to balance quality and efficiency. Across Yelp, Goodreads, and Amazon datasets, PerFine consistently improves personalization over PGraphRAG, with GEval gains of +7-13%, steady improvements over 3-5 refinement iterations, and scalability with increasing critic size. These results highlight that post-hoc, profile-aware feedback offers a powerful paradigm for personalized LLM generation that is both training-free and model-agnostic.",

To address this gap, we introduce a novel adversarial paraphrasing task: generating grammatically correct paraphrases that preserve the original query meaning while degrading segmentation performance. To evaluate the quality of adversarial paraphrases, we develop a comprehensive automatic evaluation protocol validated with human studies. Furthermore, we introduce SPARTA-a black-box, sentence-level optimization method that operates in the low-dimensional semantic latent space of a text autoencoder, guided by reinforcement learning. SPARTA achieves significantly higher success rates, outperforming prior methods by up to 2x on both the ReasonSeg and LLMSeg-40k datasets. We use SPARTA and competitive baselines to assess the robustness of advanced reasoning segmentation models.

In SynthWorlds, we construct parallel corpora representing two worlds with identical interconnected structure: a real-mapped world, where models may exploit parametric knowledge, and a synthetic-mapped world, where such knowledge is meaningless. On top of these corpora, we design two mirrored tasks as case studies: multi-hop question answering and page navigation, which maintain equal reasoning difficulty across worlds. Experiments in parametric-only (e.g., closed-book QA) and knowledge-augmented (e.g., retrieval-augmented) LM settings reveal a persistent knowledge advantage gap, defined as the performance boost models gain from memorized parametric world knowledge. Knowledge acquisition and integration mechanisms reduce but do not eliminate this gap, highlighting opportunities for system improvements.

        "summary": "Recent efforts leverage knowledge distillation techniques to develop lightweight and practical sentiment analysis models. These methods are grounded in human-written instructions and large-scale user texts. Despite the promising results, two key challenges remain: (1) manually written instructions are limited in diversity and quantity, making them insufficient to ensure comprehensive coverage of distilled knowledge; (2) large-scale user texts incur high computational cost, hindering the practicality of these methods. To this end, we introduce COMPEFFDIST, a comprehensive and efficient distillation framework for sentiment analysis. Our framework consists of two key modules: attribute-based automatic instruction construction and difficulty-based data filtering, which correspondingly tackle the aforementioned challenges. Applying our method across multiple model series (Llama-3, Qwen-3, and Gemma-3), we enable 3B student models to match the performance of 20x larger teacher models on most tasks. In addition, our approach greatly outperforms baseline methods in data efficiency, attaining the same performance level with only 10% of the data.",

We provide comparison to a Seq2Seq and LLM-based approach, showing encouraging results in our much smaller learning setting. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our transformation to an unseen simplification dataset (MedEASI), as well as datasets from languages outside the training data (ES,DE).

CoV-Eval constructs tasks by first defining verifiable targets within real-world scenarios, then systematically generating corresponding queries, textual materials, and constraints based on these targets. This ensures that tasks are both realistic and objectively assessable, enabling rigorous assessment of model capabilities in meeting complex real-world constraints. LongWeave supports customizable input/output lengths (up to 64K/8K tokens) across seven distinct tasks. Evaluation on 23 LLMs shows that even state-of-the-art models encounter significant challenges in long-form generation as real-world complexity and output length increase.",

        "summary": "Training critiquing language models to assess and provide feedback on model outputs is a promising way to improve LLMs for complex reasoning tasks. However, existing approaches typically rely on stronger supervisors for annotating critique data. To address this, we propose Critique-RL, an online RL approach for developing critiquing language models without stronger supervision. Our approach operates on a two-player paradigm: the actor generates a response, the critic provides feedback, and the actor refines the response accordingly. We first reveal that relying solely on indirect reward signals from the actor's outputs for RL optimization often leads to unsatisfactory critics: while their helpfulness (i.e., providing constructive feedback) improves, the discriminability (i.e., determining whether a response is high-quality or not) remains poor, resulting in marginal performance gains. To overcome this, Critique-RL adopts a two-stage optimization strategy. In stage I, it reinforces the discriminability of the critic with direct rule-based reward signals; in stage II, it introduces indirect rewards based on actor refinement to improve the critic's helpfulness, while maintaining its discriminability via appropriate regularization. Extensive experiments across various tasks and models show that Critique-RL delivers substantial performance improvements. For example, it achieves a 9.02% gain on in-domain tasks and a 5.70% gain on out-of-domain tasks for Qwen2.5-7B, highlighting its potential.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), particularly with algorithms like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has proven highly effective in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, a critical bottleneck in current pipelines lies in the limited diversity of sampled trajectories during group rollouts. Homogeneous trajectories and their associated rewards would diminish the return signals for policy updates, thereby hindering effective policy learning. This lack of diversity stems primarily from token-level stochastic sampling, where local variations are likely to collapse into near-identical reasoning paths. To address this limitation, we propose Lookahead Tree-Based Rollouts (LATR), a novel rollout strategy designed to explicitly promotes trajectory-level diversity by enforcing branching into different candidate tokens likely to yield distinct continuations. Specifically, LATR iteratively operates in three stages: (1) branching at high-uncertainty generation steps, (2) performing lookahead simulation for each new branch, and (3) pruning branches that exhibits prolonged similarity during simulation. Compared with stochastic Sampling, LATR accelerates policy learning by 131% on average and improves final pass@1 performance by 4.2% on both GRPO and Dynamic sAmpling Policy Optimization (DAPO) algorithms across different reasoning tasks.

We apply a structured evaluation framework to measure the translation performance of commonly seen LLMs -- GPT, Claude, Deepseek and Grok -- across different internal symbolic partitions generated by a hierarchical reinforcement learning algorithm in the Ant Maze and Ant Fall environments. Our findings reveal that although LLMs demonstrate some ability to translate natural language into a symbolic representation of the environment dynamics, their performance is highly sensitive to partition granularity and task complexity.

This insight is based on prior theoretical and empirical work showing that the curvature for memorized training points is much sharper than non memorized, meaning ordering weight components from high to low curvature can reveal a distinction without explicit labels. This motivates a weight editing procedure that suppresses far more recitation of untargeted memorized data more effectively than a recent unlearning method (BalancedSubnet), while maintaining lower perplexity. Since the basis of curvature has a natural interpretation for shared structure in model weights, we analyze the editing procedure extensively on its effect on downstream tasks in LMs, and find that fact retrieval and arithmetic are specifically and consistently negatively affected, even though open book fact retrieval and general logical reasoning is conserved. We posit these tasks rely heavily on specialized directions in weight space rather than general purpose mechanisms, regardless of whether those individual datapoints are memorized. We support this by showing a correspondence between task data's activation strength with low curvature components that we edit out, and the drop in task performance after the edit. Our work enhances the understanding of memorization in neural networks with practical applications towards removing it, and provides evidence for idiosyncratic, narrowly-used structures involved in solving tasks like math and fact retrieval.",

We propose a model that represents the text modality using an encoder extracted from our own pre-trained model named CATT. The speech component is handled by the encoder module of the OpenAI Whisper base model. Our solution is designed following two integration strategies. The former consists of fusing the speech tokens with the input at an early stage, where the 1500 frames of the audio segment are averaged over 10 consecutive frames, resulting in 150 speech tokens. To ensure embedding compatibility, these averaged tokens are processed through a linear projection layer prior to merging them with the text tokens. Contextual encoding is guaranteed by the CATT encoder module. The latter strategy relies on cross-attention, where text and speech embeddings are fused. The cross-attention output is then fed to the CATT classification head for token-level diacritic prediction. To further improve model robustness, we randomly deactivate the speech input during training, allowing the model to perform well with or without speech. Our experiments show that the proposed approach achieves a word error rate (WER) of 0.25 and a character error rate (CER) of 0.9 on the development set. On the test set, our model achieved WER and CER scores of 0.55 and 0.13, respectively.",

Existing research usually categorizes hallucination by their external properties rather than by the LLMs' underlying internal properties. This external focus overlooks that hallucinations may require tailored mitigation strategies based on their underlying mechanism. We propose a framework for categorizing hallucinations along two axes: knowledge and certainty. Since parametric knowledge and certainty may vary across models, our categorization method involves a model-specific dataset construction process that differentiates between those types of hallucinations. Along the knowledge axis, we distinguish between hallucinations caused by a lack of knowledge and those occurring despite the model having the knowledge of the correct response. To validate our framework along the knowledge axis, we apply steering mitigation, which relies on the existence of parametric knowledge to manipulate model activations. This addresses the lack of existing methods to validate knowledge categorization by showing a significant difference between the two hallucination types. We further analyze the distinct knowledge and hallucination patterns between models, showing that different hallucinations do occur despite shared parametric knowledge. Turning to the certainty axis, we identify a particularly concerning subset of hallucinations where models hallucinate with certainty despite having the correct knowledge internally. We introduce a new evaluation metric to measure the effectiveness of mitigation methods on this subset, revealing that while some methods perform well on average, they fail disproportionately on these critical cases. Our findings highlight the importance of considering both knowledge and certainty in hallucination analysis and call for targeted mitigation approaches that consider the hallucination underlying factors.",

A key problem is enabling effective and efficient knowledge transfer across LLMs of different scales, which is essential for achieving greater flexibility and broader applicability in transferring knowledge between LLMs. Due to neural incompatibility, referring to the architectural and parametric differences between LLMs of varying scales, existing methods that directly reuse layer parameters are severely limited. In this paper, we identify the semantic alignment in latent space as the fundamental prerequisite for LLM cross-scale knowledge transfer. Instead of directly using the layer parameters, our approach takes activations as the medium of layer-wise knowledge transfer. Leveraging the semantics in latent space, our approach is simple and outperforms prior work, better aligning model behaviors across varying scales. Evaluations on four benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method. Further analysis reveals the key factors easing cross-scale knowledge transfer and provides insights into the nature of latent semantic alignment.",

We present MuSaG, the first German multimodal sarcasm detection dataset, consisting of 33 minutes of manually selected and human-annotated statements from German television shows. Each instance provides aligned text, audio, and video modalities, annotated separately by humans, enabling evaluation in unimodal and multimodal settings. We benchmark nine open-source and commercial models, spanning text, audio, vision, and multimodal architectures, and compare their performance to human annotations.

        "summary": "We present Ko-MuSR, the first benchmark to comprehensively evaluate multistep, soft reasoning in long Korean narratives while minimizing data contamination. Built following MuSR, Ko-MuSR features fully Korean narratives, reasoning chains, and multiple-choice questions verified by human annotators for logical consistency and answerability. Evaluations of four large language models -- two multilingual and two Korean-specialized -- show that multilingual models outperform Korean-focused ones even in Korean reasoning tasks, indicating cross-lingual generalization of reasoning ability. Carefully designed prompting strategies, which combine few-shot examples, reasoning traces, and task-specific hints, further boost accuracy, approaching human-level performance. Ko-MuSR offers a solid foundation for advancing Korean NLP by enabling systematic evaluation of long-context reasoning and prompting strategies.",

        "summary": "While traditional line-level filtering techniques, such as line-level deduplication and trailing-punctuation filters, are commonly used, these basic methods can sometimes discard valuable content, negatively affecting downstream performance. In this paper, we introduce two methods-pattern-aware line-level deduplication (PLD) and pattern-aware trailing punctuation filtering (PTF)-by enhancing the conventional filtering techniques. Our approach not only considers line-level signals but also takes into account their sequential distribution across documents, enabling us to retain structurally important content that might otherwise be removed. We evaluate these proposed methods by training small language models (1 B parameters) in both English and Korean. The results demonstrate that our methods consistently improve performance on multiple-choice benchmarks and significantly enhance generative question-answering accuracy on both SQuAD v1 and KorQuAD v1.",

        "summary": "The Bengali language, spoken extensively across South Asia and among diasporic communities, exhibits considerable dialectal diversity shaped by geography, culture, and history. Phonological and pronunciation-based classifications broadly identify five principal dialect groups: Eastern Bengali, Manbhumi, Rangpuri, Varendri, and Rarhi. Within Bangladesh, further distinctions emerge through variation in vocabulary, syntax, and morphology, as observed in regions such as Chittagong, Sylhet, Rangpur, Rajshahi, Noakhali, and Barishal. Despite this linguistic richness, systematic research on the computational processing of Bengali dialects remains limited. This study seeks to document and analyze the phonetic and morphological properties of these dialects while exploring the feasibility of building computational models particularly Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems tailored to regional varieties. Such efforts hold potential for applications in virtual assistants and broader language technologies, contributing to both the preservation of dialectal diversity and the advancement of inclusive digital tools for Bengali-speaking communities.

        "summary": "To date, there exist almost no culturally-specific evaluation benchmarks for large language models (LLMs) that cover a large number of languages and cultures. In this paper, we present Global PIQA, a participatory commonsense reasoning benchmark for over 100 languages, constructed by hand by 335 researchers from 65 countries around the world. The 116 language varieties in Global PIQA cover five continents, 14 language families, and 23 writing systems. In the non-parallel split of Global PIQA, over 50% of examples reference local foods, customs, traditions, or other culturally-specific elements. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs perform well on Global PIQA in aggregate, but they exhibit weaker performance in lower-resource languages (up to a 37% accuracy gap, despite random chance at 50%). Open models generally perform worse than proprietary models. Global PIQA highlights that in many languages and cultures, everyday knowledge remains an area for improvement, alongside more widely-discussed capabilities such as complex reasoning and expert knowledge. Beyond its uses for LLM evaluation, we hope that Global PIQA provides a glimpse into the wide diversity of cultures in which human language is embedded.",

Unfortunately, existing MT benchmarks are not capable of exposing failures in multilingual LLMs. To disclose hallucination in multilingual LLMs, we introduce a diagnostic framework with a taxonomy that separates Instruction Detachment from Source Detachment. Guided by this taxonomy, we create HalloMTBench, a multilingual, human-verified benchmark across 11 English-to-X directions. We employed 4 frontier LLMs to generate candidates and scrutinize these candidates with an ensemble of LLM judges, and expert validation. In this way, we curate 5,435 high-quality instances.

Results reveal distinct ``hallucination triggers'' -- unique failure patterns reflecting model scale, source length sensitivity, linguistic biases, and Reinforcement-Learning (RL) amplified language mixing.

This paper introduces Pie, a programmable LLM serving system designed for flexibility and efficiency. Pie decomposes the traditional generation loop into fine-grained service handlers exposed via an API and delegates control of the generation process to user-provided programs, called inferlets. This enables applications to implement new KV cache strategies, bespoke generation logic, and seamlessly integrate computation and I/O-entirely within the application, without requiring modifications to the serving system. Pie executes inferlets using WebAssembly, benefiting from its lightweight sandboxing. Our evaluation shows Pie matches state-of-the-art performance on standard tasks (3-12% latency overhead) while significantly improving latency and throughput (1.3x-3.4x higher) on agentic workflows by enabling application-specific optimizations.",

We present a method to train large multimodal models to form conventions, enabling efficient communication. Our approach uses simulated reference games between models, and requires no additional human-produced data. In repeated reference games involving photographs and tangram images, our method enables models to communicate efficiently with people: reducing the message length by up to 41% while increasing success by 15% over the course of the interaction.

        "summary": "Knowledge Distillation (KD) has become a cornerstone technique for compressing Large Language Models (LLMs) into smaller, more efficient student models. However, conventional KD approaches typically apply the distillation loss uniformly across all tokens, regardless of the teacher's confidence. This indiscriminate mimicry can introduce noise, as the student is forced to learn from the teacher's uncertain or high-entropy predictions, which may ultimately harm student performance-especially when the teacher is much larger and more powerful. To address this, we propose Speculative Knowledge Distillation (SpecKD), a novel, plug-and-play framework that introduces a dynamic, token-level gating mechanism inspired by the \"propose-and-verify\" paradigm of speculative decoding. At each step, the student's token proposal is verified against the teacher's distribution; the distillation loss is selectively applied only to \"accepted\" tokens, while \"rejected\" tokens are masked out. Extensive experiments on diverse text generation tasks show that SpecKD consistently and significantly outperforms strong KD baselines, leading to more stable training and more capable student models, and achieving state-of-the-art results.",

Existing methods typically fine-tune LLMs to abstain from answering questions beyond their knowledge scope.

To this end, we propose a novel reinforcement learning framework built on $\\textbf{\\underline{Fi}ne-grained \\underline{S}emantic \\underline{Co}nfidence \\underline{Re}ward (\\Ours)}$, which guides LLMs to abstain via sample-specific confidence. Specifically, our method operates by sampling multiple candidate answers and conducting semantic clustering, then training the LLM to retain answers within high-confidence clusters and discard those within low-confidence ones, thereby promoting accurate post-hoc abstention. Additionally, we propose a new metric for evaluating the reliability of abstention fine-tuning tasks more comprehensively.

        "summary": "The task of information extraction (IE) is to extract structured knowledge from text. However, it is often not straightforward to utilize IE output due to the mismatch between the IE ontology and the downstream application needs. We propose a new formulation of IE TEXT2DB that emphasizes the integration of IE output and the target database (or knowledge base). Given a user instruction, a document set, and a database, our task requires the model to update the database with values from the document set to satisfy the user instruction. This task requires understanding user instructions for what to extract and adapting to the given DB/KB schema for how to extract on the fly. To evaluate this new task, we introduce a new benchmark featuring common demands such as data infilling, row population, and column addition. In addition, we propose an LLM agent framework OPAL (Observe-PlanAnalyze LLM) which includes an Observer component that interacts with the database, the Planner component that generates a code-based plan with calls to IE models, and the Analyzer component that provides feedback regarding code quality before execution. Experiments show that OPAL can successfully adapt to diverse database schemas by generating different code plans and calling the required IE models. We also highlight difficult cases such as dealing with large databases with complex dependencies and extraction hallucination, which we believe deserve further investigation.

Researchers find it efficient to use large language models (LLMs) techniques like RAG for EBM tasks.

Therefore, inspired by the meta-analysis used in EBM, we provide a new method to re-rank and filter the medical evidence. This method presents multiple principles to filter the best evidence for LLMs to diagnose. We employ a combination of several EBM methods to emulate the meta-analysis, which includes reliability analysis, heterogeneity analysis, and extrapolation analysis. These processes allow the users to retrieve the best medical evidence for the LLMs. Ultimately, we evaluate these high-quality articles and show an accuracy improvement of up to 11.4% in our experiments and results. Our method successfully enables RAG to extract higher-quality and more reliable evidence from the PubMed dataset.

        "summary": "Evidence-based medicine (EBM) research has always been of paramount importance. It is important to find appropriate medical theoretical support for the needs from physicians or patients to reduce the occurrence of medical accidents. This process is often carried out by human querying relevant literature databases, which lacks objectivity and efficiency. Therefore, researchers utilize retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to search for evidence and generate responses automatically. However, current RAG methods struggle to handle complex queries in real-world clinical scenarios. For example, when queries lack certain information or use imprecise language, the model may retrieve irrelevant evidence and generate unhelpful answers. To address this issue, we present the PICOs-RAG to expand the user queries into a better format. Our method can expand and normalize the queries into professional ones and use the PICO format, a search strategy tool present in EBM, to extract the most important information used for retrieval. This approach significantly enhances retrieval efficiency and relevance, resulting in up to an 8.8\\% improvement compared to the baseline evaluated by our method. Thereby the PICOs-RAG improves the performance of the large language models into a helpful and reliable medical assistant in EBM.",

LLMs can retrieve relevant medical articles to generate more professional responses efficiently. However, current RAG applications still face problems. They generate incorrect information, such as hallucinations, and they fail to use external knowledge correctly. To solve these issues, we propose a new method named M-Eval. This method is inspired by the heterogeneity analysis approach used in Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM). Our approach can check for factual errors in RAG responses using evidence from multiple sources. First, we extract additional medical literature from external knowledge bases. Then, we retrieve the evidence documents generated by the RAG system. We use heterogeneity analysis to check whether the evidence supports different viewpoints in the response. In addition to verifying the accuracy of the response, we also assess the reliability of the evidence provided by the RAG system. Our method shows an improvement of up to 23.31% accuracy across various LLMs. This work can help detect errors in current RAG-based medical systems. It also makes the applications of LLMs more reliable and reduces diagnostic errors.",

In this paper, we switch the point of view to evaluation, and address an additional blind spot which reveals itself when the multilingual LLM is fully finetuned with parallel multilingual dataset before unlearning. Here, language confusion occurs whereby a model responds in language different from that of the input prompt. Language confusion is a problematic phenomenon in unlearning, causing the standard reference-based metrics to fail. We tackle this phenomenon in three steps: (1) introduce N-gram-based Language-Mix (N-Mix) score to quantitatively show the language confusion is pervasive and consistent in multilingual LLMs, (2) demonstrate that reference-based metrics result in false negatives when N-Mix score is high, and(3) suggest the need of new type of unlearning evaluation that can directly assess the content of the generated sentences. We call this type of metrics as semantic-based metric.",

Our system requires no training labels or model fine-tuning, instead automatically generating and refining prompts for evaluating attribute quality across tens of thousands of product category-attribute pairs. Starting from a seed of human-crafted prompts, the cascade progressively optimizes instructions to meet catalog-specific requirements. This approach bridges the gap between general language understanding and domain-specific knowledge at scale in complex industrial catalogs. Our extensive empirical evaluations shows the auto-prompt cascade improves precision and recall by $8-10\\%$ over traditional chain-of-thought prompting. Notably, it achieves these gains while reducing domain expert effort from 5.1 hours to 3 minutes per attribute - a $99\\%$ reduction. Additionally, the cascade generalizes effectively across five languages and multiple quality assessment tasks, consistently maintaining performance gains.",

Despite significant progress in the development of methods and models that refrain from using stereotypical information in their decision-making, recent work has shown that approaches used for bias alignment are brittle. In this work, we introduce a novel and general augmentation framework that involves three plug-and-play steps and is applicable to a number of fairness evaluation benchmarks. Through application of augmentation to a fairness evaluation dataset (Bias Benchmark for Question Answering (BBQ)), we find that Large Language Models (LLMs), including state-of-the-art open and closed weight models, are susceptible to perturbations to their inputs, showcasing a higher likelihood to behave stereotypically. Furthermore, we find that such models are more likely to have biased behavior in cases where the target demographic belongs to a community less studied by the literature, underlining the need to expand the fairness and safety research to include more diverse communities.",

In this paper, we introduce AfriMTEB -- a regional expansion of MMTEB covering 59 languages, 14 tasks, and 38 datasets, including six newly added datasets.

Our system follows an agentic framework with two components: Planner agent that generates stepwise natural language plans, and SQL agent that converts these plans into executable SQL. Since SQL agent reliably adheres to the plan, our refinements focus on the planner. Unlike prior methods that rely on multiple sub-agents for planning and suffer from orchestration overhead, we introduce a feedback-guided meta-prompting strategy to refine a single planner. Failure cases from a held-out set are clustered with human input, and an LLM distills them into corrective guidelines that are integrated into the planner's system prompt, improving generalization without added complexity. For the multilingual scenario, to address transliteration and entity mismatch issues, we incorporate entity-linking guidelines that generate alternative surface forms for entities and explicitly include them in the plan. Finally, we enhance reliability through plan diversification: multiple candidate plans are generated for each query, with the SQL agent producing a query for each plan, and final output selected via majority voting over their executions.",

        "summary": "Large language model agents are increasingly used in multi-turn conversational settings to interact with and execute tasks in dynamic environments. However, a key limitation is their temporal blindness: they, by default, operate with a stationary context, failing to account for the real-world time elapsed between messages. This becomes a critical liability when an agent must decide whether to invoke a tool based on how much time has passed since the last observation. Without temporal awareness, agents often either over-rely on previous context (skipping necessary tool calls), or under-rely on it (unnecessarily repeating tool calls). To study this challenge, we introduce TicToc-v1, a test set of multi-turn user-agent trajectories across 34 scenarios with varying time sensitivity. Each trajectory ends with a user question, where the need for a tool call depends on the amount of time elapsed since the last message. To give LLMs temporal context, we augment dialogue messages with explicit timestamps, bridging the gap between static dialogue and evolving environments. We then collected human preferences for these samples, creating two subsets: one where humans preferred relying on the previous observation (prefer-noTool), and another where they preferred a new tool call (prefer-Tool). We evaluated how well LLM tool-calling decisions align with human preferences under varying time intervals on TicToc-v1. Our analysis show that without time information, most models perform only slightly better than random, with the top alignment rate being just over 60%. While adding timestamps leads to a slight improvement, particularly for larger models, the improvement is modest, peaking at around 65%. We also show that naive, prompt-based alignment have limited effectiveness. Our findings highlight the need for specific post-training alignment to align multi-turn LLM tool use with human temporal perception.",

To address this gap, we collect a motion capture dataset of American Sign Language (ASL) STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) dialogue that enables quantitative comparison between dyadic interactive signing, solo signed lecture, and interpreted articles. Using continuous kinematic features, we disentangle dialogue-specific entrainment from individual effort reduction and show spatiotemporal changes across repeated mentions of STEM terms. On average, dialogue signs are 24.6%-44.6% shorter in duration than the isolated signs, and show significant reductions absent in monologue contexts. Finally, we evaluate sign embedding models on their ability to recognize STEM signs and approximate how entrained the participants become over time.

Using figurative language as a proxy for cultural nuance and local knowledge, we design evaluation tasks for contextual understanding, pragmatic use, and connotation interpretation in Arabic and English. We evaluate 22 open- and closed-source LLMs on Egyptian Arabic idioms, multidialectal Arabic proverbs, and English proverbs. Our results show a consistent hierarchy: the average accuracy for Arabic proverbs is 4.29% lower than for English proverbs, and performance for Egyptian idioms is 10.28% lower than for Arabic proverbs. For the pragmatic use task, accuracy drops by 14.07% relative to understanding, though providing contextual idiomatic sentences improves accuracy by 10.66%. Models also struggle with connotative meaning, reaching at most 85.58% agreement with human annotators on idioms with 100% inter-annotator agreement. These findings demonstrate that figurative language serves as an effective diagnostic for cultural reasoning: while LLMs can often interpret figurative meaning, they face challenges in using it appropriately.

        "summary": "Despite rapid progress in Multi-modal Large Language Models and Large Audio-Language Models, existing audio benchmarks largely test semantics that can be recovered from text captions, masking deficits in fine-grained perceptual reasoning. We formalize audio 4D intelligence that is defined as reasoning over sound dynamics in time and 3D space, and introduce STAR-Bench to measure it. STAR-Bench combines a Foundational Acoustic Perception setting (six attributes under absolute and relative regimes) with a Holistic Spatio-Temporal Reasoning setting that includes segment reordering for continuous and discrete processes and spatial tasks spanning static localization, multi-source relations, and dynamic trajectories. Our data curation pipeline uses two methods to ensure high-quality samples. For foundational tasks, we use procedurally synthesized and physics-simulated audio. For holistic data, we follow a four-stage process that includes human annotation and final selection based on human performance. Unlike prior benchmarks where caption-only answering reduces accuracy slightly, STAR-Bench induces far larger drops (-31.5\\% temporal, -35.2\\% spatial), evidencing its focus on linguistically hard-to-describe cues. Evaluating 19 models reveals substantial gaps compared with humans and a capability hierarchy: closed-source models are bottlenecked by fine-grained perception, while open-source models lag across perception, knowledge, and reasoning. Our STAR-Bench provides critical insights and a clear path forward for developing future models with a more robust understanding of the physical world.",

        "summary": "While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) excel at visual understanding, they often struggle in complex scenarios that require visual planning and imagination. Inspired by how humans use sketching as a form of visual thinking to develop and communicate ideas, we introduce Latent Sketchpad, a framework that equips MLLMs with an internal visual scratchpad. The internal visual representations of MLLMs have traditionally been confined to perceptual understanding. We repurpose them to support generative visual thought without compromising reasoning ability. Building on frontier MLLMs, our approach integrates visual generation directly into their native autoregressive reasoning process. It allows the model to interleave textual reasoning with the generation of visual latents. These latents guide the internal thought process and can be translated into sketch images for interpretability. To realize this, we introduce two components: a Context-Aware Vision Head autoregressively produces visual representations, and a pretrained Sketch Decoder renders these into human-interpretable images. We evaluate the framework on our new dataset MazePlanning. Experiments across various MLLMs show that Latent Sketchpad delivers comparable or even superior reasoning performance to their backbone. It further generalizes across distinct frontier MLLMs, including Gemma3 and Qwen2.5-VL. By extending model's textual reasoning to visual thinking, our framework opens new opportunities for richer human-computer interaction and broader applications.

While these agents hold great promise for advancing digital automation, their potential for unsafe operations, such as system compromise and privacy leakage, is raising significant concerns. Detecting these safety concerns across the vast and complex operational space of mobile environments presents a formidable challenge that remains critically underexplored. To establish a foundation for mobile agent safety research, we introduce MobileRisk-Live, a dynamic sandbox environment accompanied by a safety detection benchmark comprising realistic trajectories with fine-grained annotations. Built upon this, we propose OS-Sentinel, a novel hybrid safety detection framework that synergistically combines a Formal Verifier for detecting explicit system-level violations with a VLM-based Contextual Judge for assessing contextual risks and agent actions. Experiments show that OS-Sentinel achieves 10%-30% improvements over existing approaches across multiple metrics. Further analysis provides critical insights that foster the development of safer and more reliable autonomous mobile agents.",

PRDBench features rich data sources, high task complexity, and flexible metrics. We further employ an Agent-as-a-Judge paradigm to score agent outputs, enabling the evaluation of various test types beyond unit tests.

Addressing this is challenging due to the scarcity of high-quality data and the limitations of existing methods: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) often compromises general capabilities, while reinforcement fine-tuning (RFT) prioritizes textual reasoning over visual perception. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel two-stage task that structures visual perception learning as a coarse-to-fine progressive process. Based on this task formulation, we develop ViPER, a self-bootstrapping framework specifically designed to enable iterative evolution through self-critiquing and self-prediction. By synergistically integrating image-level and instance-level reconstruction with a two-stage reinforcement learning strategy, ViPER establishes a closed-loop training paradigm, where internally synthesized data directly fuel the enhancement of perceptual ability. Applied to the Qwen2.5-VL family, ViPER produces the Qwen-Viper series. With an average gain of 1.7% on seven comprehensive benchmarks spanning various tasks and up to 6.0% on fine-grained perception, Qwen-Viper consistently demonstrates superior performance across different vision-language scenarios while maintaining generalizability. Beyond enabling self-improvement in perceptual capabilities, ViPER provides concrete evidence for the reciprocal relationship between generation and understanding, a breakthrough to developing more autonomous and capable VLMs.",

To address this challenge, we reformulate reasoning in LVLMs as posterior inference and propose a scalable training algorithm based on amortized variational inference. By leveraging diversity-seeking reinforcement learning algorithms, we introduce a novel sparse reward function for token-level learning signals that encourage diverse, high-likelihood latent CoT, overcoming deterministic sampling limitations and avoiding reward hacking. Additionally, we implement a Bayesian inference-scaling strategy that replaces costly Best-of-N and Beam Search with a marginal likelihood to efficiently rank optimal rationales and answers.

It combines three key ideas: (1) the online multi-response generation and normalization of GRPO, (2) the implicit reward formulation of DPO, and (3) the implicit-explicit reward alignment principle of UNA. By jointly normalizing the implicit and explicit rewards, GIFT eliminates an otherwise intractable term that prevents effective use of implicit rewards. This normalization transforms the complex reward maximization objective into a simple mean squared error (MSE) loss between the normalized reward functions, converting a non-convex optimization problem into a convex, stable, and analytically differentiable formulation. Unlike offline methods such as DPO and UNA, GIFT remains on-policy and thus retains exploration capability. Compared to GRPO, it requires fewer hyperparameters, converges faster, and generalizes better with significantly reduced training overfitting.

Experiments on the Librispeech biasing benchmark show that our method effectively filters out majority of the candidate phrases, and significantly improves recognition accuracy under different biasing conditions when the scores are used in shallow fusion biasing.

To address this new setting, we present RoboOmni, a Perceiver-Thinker-Talker-Executor framework based on end-to-end omni-modal LLMs that unifies intention recognition, interaction confirmation, and action execution. RoboOmni fuses auditory and visual signals spatiotemporally for robust intention recognition, while supporting direct speech interaction. To address the absence of training data for proactive intention recognition in robotic manipulation, we build OmniAction, comprising 140k episodes, 5k+ speakers, 2.4k event sounds, 640 backgrounds, and six contextual instruction types.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated impressive multimodal reasoning capabilities, yet their understanding of purely numerical time-series signals remains limited. Existing approaches mainly focus on forecasting or trend description, without uncovering the latent events that drive numerical changes or explaining the reasoning process behind them. In this work, we introduce the task of number-to-event reasoning and decoding, which aims to infer interpretable structured events from numerical inputs, even when current text is unavailable. To address the data scarcity and semantic alignment challenges, we propose a reasoning-aware framework that integrates an agent-guided event extractor (AGE), a marked multivariate Hawkes-based synthetic generator (EveDTS), and a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline combining a time-series encoder with a structured decoder. Our model explicitly reasons over numerical changes, generates intermediate explanations, and outputs structured event hypotheses. Experiments on multi-domain datasets show that our method substantially outperforms strong LLM baselines in event-level precision and recall. These results suggest a new direction for bridging quantitative reasoning and semantic understanding, enabling LLMs to explain and predict events directly from numerical dynamics.",

While prior studies integrate medical knowledge to improve prediction accuracy, they overlook the opportunity to simultaneously expand such knowledge through predictive processes. We develop a Closed-Loop Large Language Model (LLM)-Knowledge Graph framework that integrates prediction and knowledge expansion in an iterative learning cycle. In the knowledge-aware depression detection phase, the LLM jointly performs depression detection and entity extraction, while the knowledge graph represents and weights these entities to refine prediction performance. In the knowledge refinement and expansion phase, new entities, relationships, and entity types extracted by the LLM are incorporated into the knowledge graph under expert supervision, enabling continual knowledge evolution. Using large-scale UGC, the framework enhances both predictive accuracy and medical understanding. Expert evaluations confirmed the discovery of clinically meaningful symptoms, comorbidities, and social triggers complementary to existing literature. We conceptualize and operationalize prediction-through-learning and learning-through-prediction as mutually reinforcing processes, advancing both methodological and theoretical understanding in predictive analytics. The framework demonstrates the co-evolution of computational models and domain knowledge, offering a foundation for adaptive, data-driven knowledge systems applicable to other dynamic risk monitoring contexts.",

In this paper, we first propose BERT-ViT-EF, a novel model that combines powerful Transformer-based encoders BERT for textual input and ViT for visual input through an early fusion strategy. This approach facilitates deeper cross-modal interactions and more effective joint representation learning. To further enhance the model's capability, we propose an extension called the Dual Transformer Contrastive Network (DTCN), which builds upon BERT-ViT-EF. DTCN incorporates an additional Transformer encoder layer after BERT to refine textual context (before fusion) and employs contrastive learning to align text and image representations, fostering robust multimodal feature learning. Empirical results on two widely used MSA benchmarks MVSA-Single and TumEmo demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. DTCN achieves best accuracy (78.4%) and F1-score (78.3%) on TumEmo, and delivers competitive performance on MVSA-Single, with 76.6% accuracy and 75.9% F1-score. These improvements highlight the benefits of early fusion and deeper contextual modeling in Transformer-based multimodal sentiment analysis.",

Despite its empirical success, the theoretical understanding of RLHF is still limited, as learning the KL-regularized target with only preference feedback poses additional challenges compared with canonical RL. Existing works mostly study the reward-based Bradley-Terry (BT) preference model, and extend classical designs utilizing optimism or pessimism. This work, instead, considers the general preference model (whose practical relevance has been observed recently) and obtains performance guarantees with major, order-wise improvements over existing ones. Surprisingly, these results are derived from algorithms that directly use the empirical estimates (i.e., greedy sampling), as opposed to constructing optimistic or pessimistic estimates in previous works. This insight has a deep root in the unique structural property of the optimal policy class under the KL-regularized target, and we further specialize it to the BT model, highlighting the surprising sufficiency of greedy sampling in RLHF.",

That is surprising, as this framework is naturally suited for hierarchical control applications in general, and autonomous driving tasks in specific. Therefore, in this work the options framework is applied and tailored to autonomous driving tasks on highways. More specifically, we define dedicated options for longitudinal and lateral manoeuvres with embedded safety and comfort constraints. This way, prior domain knowledge can be incorporated into the learning process and the learned driving behaviour can be constrained more easily. We propose several setups for hierarchical control with options and derive practical algorithms following state-of-the-art reinforcement learning techniques. By separately selecting actions for longitudinal and lateral control, the introduced policies over combined and hybrid options obtain the same expressiveness and flexibility that human drivers have, while being easier to interpret than classical policies over continuous actions. Of all the investigated approaches, these flexible policies over hybrid options perform the best under varying traffic conditions, outperforming the baseline policies over actions.",

Yet, these methods recover only the linear span of top eigenfunctions of the kernel, whereas exact spectral decomposition is essential for understanding feature ordering and importance. In this work, we propose a general framework to extract ordered and identifiable eigenfunctions, based on modular building blocks designed to satisfy key desiderata, including compatibility with the contextual kernel and scalability to modern settings. We then show how two main methodological paradigms, low-rank approximation and Rayleigh quotient optimization, align with this framework for eigenfunction extraction. Finally, we validate our approach on synthetic kernels and demonstrate on real-world image datasets that the recovered eigenvalues act as effective importance scores for feature selection, enabling principled efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs via adaptive-dimensional representations.",

        "summary": "Accurately predicting the three-dimensional structures of protein-ligand complexes remains a fundamental challenge in computational drug discovery that limits the pace and success of therapeutic design. Deep learning methods have recently shown strong potential as structural prediction tools, achieving promising accuracy across diverse biomolecular systems. However, their performance and utility are constrained by scarce experimental data, inefficient architectures, physically invalid poses, and the limited ability to exploit auxiliary information available at inference. To address these issues, we introduce Pearl (Placing Every Atom in the Right Location), a foundation model for protein-ligand cofolding at scale. Pearl addresses these challenges with three key innovations: (1) training recipes that include large-scale synthetic data to overcome data scarcity; (2) architectures that incorporate an SO(3)-equivariant diffusion module to inherently respect 3D rotational symmetries, improving generalization and sample efficiency, and (3) controllable inference, including a generalized multi-chain templating system supporting both protein and non-polymeric components as well as dual unconditional/conditional modes. Pearl establishes a new state-of-the-art performance in protein-ligand cofolding. On the key metric of generating accurate (RMSD < 2 √Ö) and physically valid poses, Pearl surpasses AlphaFold 3 and other open source baselines on the public Runs N' Poses and PoseBusters benchmarks, delivering 14.5% and 14.2% improvements, respectively, over the next best model. In the pocket-conditional cofolding regime, Pearl delivers $3.6\\times$ improvement on a proprietary set of challenging, real-world drug targets at the more rigorous RMSD < 1 √Ö threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that model performance correlates directly with synthetic dataset size used in training.",

        "summary": "Predicting causal structure from time series data is crucial for understanding complex phenomena in physiology, brain connectivity, climate dynamics, and socio-economic behaviour. Causal discovery in time series is hindered by the combinatorial complexity of identifying true causal relationships, especially as the number of variables and time points grow. A common approach to simplify the task is the so-called ordering-based methods. Traditional ordering methods inherently limit the representational capacity of the resulting model. In this work, we fix this issue by leveraging multiple valid causal orderings, instead of a single one as standard practice. We propose DOTS (Diffusion Ordered Temporal Structure), using diffusion-based causal discovery for temporal data. By integrating multiple orderings, DOTS effectively recovers the transitive closure of the underlying directed acyclic graph, mitigating spurious artifacts inherent in single-ordering approaches. We formalise the problem under standard assumptions such as stationarity and the additive noise model, and leverage score matching with diffusion processes to enable efficient Hessian estimation. Extensive experiments validate the approach. Empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that DOTS outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, offering a scalable and robust approach to temporal causal discovery. On synthetic benchmarks ($d{=}\\!3-\\!6$ variables, $T{=}200\\!-\\!5{,}000$ samples), DOTS improves mean window-graph $F1$ from $0.63$ (best baseline) to $0.81$. On the CausalTime real-world benchmark ($d{=}20\\!-\\!36$), while baselines remain the best on individual datasets, DOTS attains the highest average summary-graph $F1$ while halving runtime relative to graph-optimisation methods. These results establish DOTS as a scalable and accurate solution for temporal causal discovery.",

However, extracting reliable HIs remains challenging due to variability in material properties, stochastic damage evolution, and diverse damage modes. Manufacturing defects (e.g., disbonds) and in-service incidents (e.g., bird strikes) further complicate this process. This study presents a comprehensive data-driven framework that learns HIs via two learning approaches integrated with multi-domain signal processing. Because ground-truth HIs are unavailable, a semi-supervised and an unsupervised approach are proposed: (i) a diversity deep semi-supervised anomaly detection (Diversity-DeepSAD) approach augmented with continuous auxiliary labels used as hypothetical damage proxies, which overcomes the limitation of prior binary labels that only distinguish healthy and failed states while neglecting intermediate degradation, and (ii) a degradation-trend-constrained variational autoencoder (DTC-VAE), in which the monotonicity criterion is embedded via an explicit trend constraint. Guided waves with multiple excitation frequencies are used to monitor single-stiffener composite structures under fatigue loading. Time, frequency, and time-frequency representations are explored, and per-frequency HIs are fused via unsupervised ensemble learning to mitigate frequency dependence and reduce variance. Using fast Fourier transform features, the augmented Diversity-DeepSAD model achieved 81.6% performance, while DTC-VAE delivered the most consistent HIs with 92.3% performance, outperforming existing baselines.",

In this paper, we propose DistDF, which achieves alignment by alternatively minimizing a discrepancy between the conditional forecast and label distributions. Because conditional discrepancies are difficult to estimate from finite time-series observations, we introduce a newly proposed joint-distribution Wasserstein discrepancy for time-series forecasting, which provably upper bounds the conditional discrepancy of interest. This discrepancy admits tractable, differentiable estimation from empirical samples and integrates seamlessly with gradient-based training.

        "summary": "With the widespread adoption of LLMs, LoRA has become a dominant method for PEFT, and its initialization methods have attracted increasing attention. However, existing methods have notable limitations: many methods do not incorporate target-domain data, while gradient-based methods exploit data only at a shallow level by relying on one-step gradient decomposition, which remains unsatisfactory due to the weak empirical performance of the one-step fine-tuning model that serves as their basis, as well as the fact that these methods either lack a rigorous theoretical foundation or depend heavily on restrictive isotropic assumptions. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework for data-aware LoRA initialization based on asymptotic analysis. Starting from a general optimization objective that minimizes the expectation of the parameter discrepancy between the fine-tuned and target models, we derive an optimization problem with two components: a bias term, which is related to the parameter distance between the fine-tuned and target models, and is approximated using a Fisher-gradient formulation to preserve anisotropy; and a variance term, which accounts for the uncertainty introduced by sampling stochasticity through the Fisher information. By solving this problem, we obtain an optimal initialization strategy for LoRA. Building on this theoretical framework, we develop an efficient algorithm, LoRA-DA, which estimates the terms in the optimization problem from a small set of target domain samples and obtains the optimal LoRA initialization. Empirical results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoRA-DA consistently improves final accuracy over existing initialization methods. Additional studies show faster, more stable convergence, robustness across ranks, and only a small initialization overhead for LoRA-DA. The source code will be released upon publication.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning algorithms are typically designed for discrete-time dynamics, even though the underlying real-world control systems are often continuous in time. In this paper, we study the problem of continuous-time reinforcement learning, where the unknown system dynamics are represented using nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). We leverage probabilistic models, such as Gaussian processes and Bayesian neural networks, to learn an uncertainty-aware model of the underlying ODE. Our algorithm, COMBRL, greedily maximizes a weighted sum of the extrinsic reward and model epistemic uncertainty. This yields a scalable and sample-efficient approach to continuous-time model-based RL. We show that COMBRL achieves sublinear regret in the reward-driven setting, and in the unsupervised RL setting (i.e., without extrinsic rewards), we provide a sample complexity bound. In our experiments, we evaluate COMBRL in both standard and unsupervised RL settings and demonstrate that it scales better, is more sample-efficient than prior methods, and outperforms baselines across several deep RL tasks.",

        "summary": "Make-on-demand combinatorial synthesis libraries (CSLs) like Enamine REAL have significantly enabled drug discovery efforts. However, their large size presents a challenge for virtual screening, where the goal is to identify the top compounds in a library according to a computational objective (e.g., optimizing docking score) subject to computational constraints under a limited computational budget. For current library sizes -- numbering in the tens of billions of compounds -- and scoring functions of interest, a routine virtual screening campaign may be limited to scoring fewer than 0.1% of the available compounds, leaving potentially many high scoring compounds undiscovered. Furthermore, as constraints (and sometimes objectives) change during the course of a virtual screening campaign, existing virtual screening algorithms typically offer little room for amortization. We propose the approximate-but-exhaustive search protocol for CSLs, or APEX. APEX utilizes a neural network surrogate that exploits the structure of CSLs in the prediction of objectives and constraints to make full enumeration on a consumer GPU possible in under a minute, allowing for exact retrieval of approximate top-$k$ sets. To demonstrate APEX's capabilities, we develop a benchmark CSL comprised of more than 10 million compounds, all of which have been annotated with their docking scores on five medically relevant targets along with physicohemical properties measured with RDKit such that, for any objective and set of constraints, the ground truth top-$k$ compounds can be identified and compared against the retrievals from any virtual screening algorithm. We show APEX's consistently strong performance both in retrieval accuracy and runtime compared to alternative methods.",

Despite rapid progress in generative modeling, there is limited attention to comprehensive evaluation, leaving unclear how reliable, safe, and useful synthetic data truly are. Existing evaluations remain fragmented, typically limited to population-level representativeness or record-level privacy, without considering group-level variations or task-specific utility. To address this gap, we propose a Representativeness-Privacy-Utility (RPU) framework that systematically evaluates synthetic trip data across three complementary dimensions and three hierarchical levels (record, group, population). The framework integrates a consistent set of metrics to quantify similarity, disclosure risk, and practical usefulness, enabling transparent and balanced assessment of synthetic data quality. We apply the framework to benchmark twelve representative generation methods, spanning conventional statistical models, deep generative networks, and privacy-enhanced variants. Results show that synthetic data do not inherently guarantee privacy and there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" model, the trade-off between privacy and representativeness/utility is obvious. Conditional Tabular generative adversarial network (CTGAN) provide the most balanced trade-off and is suggested for practical applications. The RPU framework provides a systematic and reproducible basis for researchers and practitioners to compare synthetic data generation techniques and select appropriate methods in public transport applications.",

This work proposes a novel two-step data-centric approach to enhance the performance of ML models by improving data quality and filtering low-confidence predictions. The first step involves leveraging Instance Hardness (IH) to filter problematic instances during training, thereby refining the dataset. The second step introduces a confidence-based rejection mechanism during inference, ensuring that only reliable predictions are retained. We evaluate our approach using three real-world healthcare datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness at improving model reliability while balancing predictive performance and rejection rate. Additionally, we use alternative criteria - influence values for filtering and uncertainty for rejection - as baselines to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method. The results demonstrate that integrating IH filtering with confidence-based rejection effectively enhances model performance while preserving a large proportion of instances.

We analyze how prompt design, architectural choices, and training strategies influence multimodal ICL. To our knowledge, we are the first to analyze how attention patterns in VLMs vary with an increasing number of in-context demonstrations. Our results reveal that training on imag-text interleaved data enhances ICL performance but does not imply effective integration of visual and textual information from demonstration examples. In contrast, instruction tuning improves instruction-following but can reduce reliance on in-context demonstrations, suggesting a trade-off between instruction alignment and in-context adaptation. Attention analyses further show that current VLMs primarily focus on textual cues and fail to leverage visual information, suggesting a limited capacity for multimodal integration. These findings highlight key limitations in the ICL abilities of current VLMs and provide insights for enhancing their ability to learn from multimodal in-context examples.",

Our method estimates the number of clusters more accurately than handcrafted model selection procedures such as AIC, BIC and Variational Inference (VI), and achieves clustering quality competitive with VI while being orders of magnitude faster.

In extensive experiments on artificial and real-life data, we demonstrate how EDC is able to discover both the structure of the target equation as well as the value of its parameters, outperforming the current state-of-the-art ED-based classification methods in binary classification and achieving performance comparable to the state of the art in binary classification. We suggest a grammar of modest complexity that appears to work well on the tested datasets but argue that the exact grammar -- and thus the complexity of the models -- is configurable, and especially domain-specific expressions can be included in the pattern language, where that is required. The presented grammar consists of a series of summands (additive terms) that include linear, quadratic and exponential terms, as well as products of two features (producing hyperbolic curves ideal for capturing XOR-like dependencies). The experiments demonstrate that this grammar allows fairly flexible decision boundaries while not so rich to cause overfitting.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models capable of handling extended contexts are in high demand, yet their inference remains challenging due to substantial Key-Value cache size and high memory bandwidth requirements. Previous research has demonstrated that KV cache exhibits low-rank characteristics within the hidden dimension, suggesting the potential for effective compression. However, due to the widely adopted Rotary Position Embedding mechanism in modern LLMs, naive low-rank compression suffers severe accuracy degradation or creates a new speed bottleneck, as the low-rank cache must first be reconstructed in order to apply RoPE. In this paper, we introduce two key insights: first, the application of RoPE to the key vectors increases their variance, which in turn results in a higher rank; second, after the key vectors are transformed into the latent space, they largely maintain their representation across most layers. Based on these insights, we propose the Sparse Attention in Latent Space framework. SALS projects the KV cache into a compact latent space via low-rank projection, and performs sparse token selection using RoPE-free query-key interactions in this space. By reconstructing only a small subset of important tokens, it avoids the overhead of full KV cache reconstruction. We comprehensively evaluate SALS on various tasks using two large-scale models: LLaMA2-7b-chat and Mistral-7b, and additionally verify its scalability on the RULER-128k benchmark with LLaMA3.1-8B-Instruct. Experimental results demonstrate that SALS achieves SOTA performance by maintaining competitive accuracy. Under different settings, SALS achieves 6.4-fold KV cache compression and 5.7-fold speed-up in the attention operator compared to FlashAttention2 on the 4K sequence. For the end-to-end throughput performance, we achieves 1.4-fold and 4.5-fold improvement compared to GPT-fast on 4k and 32K sequences, respectively.",

Most of the research in this field focuses on embedding-based methods, often leveraging convolutional neural net architectures. These solutions act as black boxes, limiting insight. In this paper, we explore an extension to an established rule-based framework, TLogic, that yields a high accuracy in combination with explainable predictions. This offers transparency and allows the end-user to critically evaluate the rules applied at the end of the prediction stage. The new rule format incorporates entity category as a key component with the purpose of limiting rule application only to relevant entities.

        "summary": "Reward models (RMs) are central to reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), providing the critical supervision signals that align large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. While generative reward models (GRMs) offer greater interpretability than traditional scalar RMs, current training paradigms remain limited. Pair-wise methods rely on binary good-versus-bad labels, which cause mismatches for point-wise inference and necessitate complex pairing strategies for effective application in RLHF. On the other hand, point-wise methods require more elaborate absolute labeling with rubric-driven criteria, resulting in poor adaptability and high annotation costs. In this work, we propose the Preference-Aware Task-Adaptive Reward Model (PaTaRM), a unified framework that integrates a preference-aware reward (PAR) mechanism with dynamic rubric adaptation. PaTaRM leverages relative preference information from pairwise data to construct robust point-wise training signals, eliminating the need for explicit point-wise labels. Simultaneously, it employs a task-adaptive rubric system that flexibly generates evaluation criteria for both global task consistency and instance-specific fine-grained reasoning. This design enables efficient, generalizable, and interpretable reward modeling for RLHF. Extensive experiments show that PaTaRM achieves an average relative improvement of 4.7% on RewardBench and RMBench across Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-14B models. Furthermore, PaTaRM boosts downstream RLHF performance, with an average improvement of 13.6% across IFEval and InFoBench benchmarks, confirming its effectiveness and robustness.

In contrast, the sparse Information Directed Sampling (IDS) algo- rithm satisfies a Bayesian regret bound that has the optimal rate in both regimes simultaneously. In this work, we explore the use of Sparse Optimistic Informa- tion Directed Sampling (SOIDS) to achieve the same adaptivity in the worst-case setting, without Bayesian assumptions. Through a novel analysis that enables the use of a time-dependent learning rate, we show that SOIDS can optimally balance information and regret.

Existing methods almost exclusively rely on global criteria to estimate the risk of privacy failure associated to a model, offering only quantitative non interpretable insights. The absence of rigorous evaluation methods for data privacy at the sample-level may hinder the practical deployment of synthetic data in real-world applications. Using extreme value statistics on nearest-neighbor distances, we propose PRIVET, a generic sample-based, modality-agnostic algorithm that assigns an individual privacy leak score to each synthetic sample. We empirically demonstrate that PRIVET reliably detects instances of memorization and privacy leakage across diverse data modalities, including settings with very high dimensionality, limited sample sizes such as genetic data and even under underfitting regimes. We compare our method to existing approaches under controlled settings and show its advantage in providing both dataset level and sample level assessments through qualitative and quantitative outputs.

        "summary": "In dynamical system modeling, traditional numerical methods are limited by high computational costs, while modern data-driven approaches struggle with data scarcity and distribution shifts. To address these fundamental limitations, we first propose SPARK, a physics-guided quantitative augmentation plugin. Specifically, SPARK utilizes a reconstruction autoencoder to integrate physical parameters into a physics-rich discrete state dictionary. This state dictionary then acts as a structured dictionary of physical states, enabling the creation of new, physically-plausible training samples via principled interpolation in the latent space. Further, for downstream prediction, these augmented representations are seamlessly integrated with a Fourier-enhanced Graph ODE, a combination designed to robustly model the enriched data distribution while capturing long-term temporal dependencies. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that SPARK significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, particularly in challenging out-of-distribution scenarios and data-scarce regimes, proving the efficacy of our physics-guided augmentation paradigm.",

        "summary": "Federated Learning has seen an increased deployment in real-world scenarios recently, as it enables the distributed training of machine learning models without explicit data sharing between individual clients. Yet, the introduction of the so-called gradient inversion attacks has fundamentally challenged its privacy-preserving properties. Unfortunately, as these attacks mostly rely on direct data optimization without any formal guarantees, the vulnerability of real-world systems remains in dispute and requires tedious testing for each new federated deployment. To overcome these issues, recently the SPEAR attack was introduced, which is based on a theoretical analysis of the gradients of linear layers with ReLU activations. While SPEAR is an important theoretical breakthrough, the attack's practicality was severely limited by its exponential runtime in the batch size b. In this work, we fill this gap by applying State-of-the-Art techniques from Sparsely-Used Dictionary Learning to make the problem of gradient inversion on linear layers with ReLU activations tractable. Our experiments demonstrate that our new attack, SPEAR++, retains all desirable properties of SPEAR, such as robustness to DP noise and FedAvg aggregation, while being applicable to 10x bigger batch sizes.",

However, existing subtitle generation methods primarily speech-based transcription or OCR-based extraction suffer from several shortcomings, including poor synchronization, incorrect or harmful text, inconsistent formatting, inappropriate reading speeds, and the inability to adapt to dynamic audio-visual contexts. Current approaches often address isolated issues, leaving post-editing as a labor-intensive and time-consuming process. In this paper, we introduce V-SAT (Video Subtitle Annotation Tool), a unified framework that automatically detects and corrects a wide range of subtitle quality issues. By combining Large Language Models(LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), Image Processing, and Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), V-SAT leverages contextual cues from both audio and video. Subtitle quality improved, with the SUBER score reduced from 9.6 to 3.54 after resolving all language mode issues and F1-scores of ~0.80 for image mode issues. Human-in-the-loop validation ensures high-quality results, providing the first comprehensive solution for robust subtitle annotation.",

These systems operate far from equilibrium, where energy dissipation and time irreversibility are key to their behavior, but are difficult to quantify from data. Learning accurate and interpretable models of such dynamics remains a major challenge: the models must be expressive enough to describe diverse processes, yet constrained enough to remain physically meaningful and mathematically identifiable. Here, we introduce I-OnsagerNet, a neural framework that learns dissipative stochastic dynamics directly from trajectories while ensuring both interpretability and uniqueness. I-OnsagerNet extends the Onsager principle to guarantee that the learned potential is obtained from the stationary density and that the drift decomposes cleanly into time-reversible and time-irreversible components, as dictated by the Helmholtz decomposition. Our approach enables us to calculate the entropy production and to quantify irreversibility, offering a principled way to detect and quantify deviations from equilibrium. Applications to polymer stretching in elongational flow and to stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics reveal new insights, including super-linear scaling of barrier heights and sub-linear scaling of entropy production rates with the strain rate, and the suppression of irreversibility with increasing batch size. I-OnsagerNet thus establishes a general, data-driven framework for discovering and interpreting non-equilibrium dynamics.",

Parameter identification of electrochemical battery models is widely recognized as a powerful method for battery health assessment. However, conventional metaheuristic approaches suffer from high computational cost and slow convergence, and recent machine learning methods are limited by their reliance on constant current data, which may not be available in practice. To overcome these challenges, we propose deep learning-based framework for parameter identification of electrochemical battery models. The proposed framework combines a neural surrogate model of the single particle model with electrolyte (NeuralSPMe) and a deep learning-based fixed-point iteration method. NeuralSPMe is trained on realistic EV load profiles to accurately predict lithium concentration dynamics under dynamic operating conditions while a parameter update network (PUNet) performs fixed-point iterative updates to significantly reduce both the evaluation time per sample and the overall number of iterations required for convergence. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that the proposed framework accelerates the parameter identification by more than 2000 times, achieves superior sample efficiency and more than 10 times higher accuracy compared to conventional metaheuristic algorithms, particularly under dynamic load scenarios encountered in practical applications.",

Causal CNNs are shown to capture spectral features both implicitly and explicitly, offering enhanced interpretability for tasks involving dynamic systems. Leveraging the associative property of convolution, we further show that the entire network can be reduced to an equivalent single-layer filter resembling an FIR filter optimized via least-squares criteria. This equivalence yields new insights into the spectral learning behavior of CNNs trained on signals with sparse frequency content. The approach is validated on both simulated beam dynamics and real-world bridge vibration datasets, underlining its relevance for modeling and identifying physical systems governed by dynamic responses.",

Through a carefully designed ablation study, we observe that certain words (termed concepts) and their associated documents are more important. Based on this insight, we propose Graph-Guided Concept Selection (G2ConS). Its core comprises a chunk selection method and an LLM-independent concept graph. The former selects salient document chunks to reduce KG construction costs; the latter closes knowledge gaps introduced by chunk selection at zero cost.

Specifically, we introduce the Information-Minimum Denoising Score Entropy (I-MDSE) relation, which links mutual information between data and its diffused version to the minimum denoising score entropy (DSE) loss. We extend this theory to masked diffusion and establish the Information-Minimum Denoising Cross-Entropy (I-MDCE) relation, connecting cross-entropy losses to mutual information in discrete masked processes. These results provide a time-integral decomposition of the log-likelihood of the data in terms of optimal score-based losses, showing that commonly used losses such as DSE and DCE are not merely variational bounds but tight and principled estimators of log-likelihood. The I-MDCE decomposition further enables practical extensions, including time-free formula, conditional likelihood estimation in prompt-response tasks, and coupled Monte Carlo estimation of likelihood ratios. Experiments on synthetic and real-world data confirm the accuracy, variance stability, and utility of our estimators. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/Dongjae0324/infodis.",

However, we analyze that FP8 quantization offers speedup primarily for large-dimensional matrix multiplications, while inherent quantization overheads diminish speedup when applied to low-rank adaptation (LoRA), which uses small-dimensional matrices for efficient fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs). To address this limitation, we propose FALQON, a novel framework that eliminates the quantization overhead from separate LoRA computational paths by directly merging LoRA adapters into an FP8-quantized backbone during fine-tuning. Furthermore, we reformulate the forward and backward computations for merged adapters to significantly reduce quantization overhead, and introduce a row-wise proxy update mechanism that efficiently integrates substantial updates into the quantized backbone. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that FALQON achieves approximately a 3$\\times$ training speedup over existing quantized LoRA methods with a similar level of accuracy, providing a practical solution for efficient large-scale model fine-tuning. Moreover, FALQON's end-to-end FP8 workflow removes the need for post-training quantization, facilitating efficient deployment. Code is available at https://github.com/iamkanghyunchoi/falqon.",

Here we present FolDE, an ALDE method designed to maximize end-of-campaign success. In simulations across 20 protein targets, FolDE discovers 23% more top 10% mutants than the best baseline ALDE method (p=0.005) and is 55% more likely to find top 1% mutants. FolDE achieves this primarily through naturalness-based warm-starting, which augments limited activity measurements with protein language model outputs to improve activity prediction.

        "summary": "Accurate and long-term spatiotemporal prediction for complex physical systems remains a fundamental challenge in scientific computing. While deep learning models, as powerful parametric approximators, have shown remarkable success, they suffer from a critical limitation: the accumulation of errors during long-term autoregressive rollouts often leads to physically implausible artifacts. This deficiency arises from their purely parametric nature, which struggles to capture the full constraints of a system's intrinsic dynamics. To address this, we introduce a novel \\textbf{Retrieval-Augmented Prediction (RAP)} framework, a hybrid paradigm that synergizes the predictive power of deep networks with the grounded truth of historical data. The core philosophy of RAP is to leverage historical evolutionary exemplars as a non-parametric estimate of the system's local dynamics. For any given state, RAP efficiently retrieves the most similar historical analog from a large-scale database. The true future evolution of this analog then serves as a \\textbf{reference target}. Critically, this target is not a hard constraint in the loss function but rather a powerful conditional input to a specialized dual-stream architecture. It provides strong \\textbf{dynamic guidance}, steering the model's predictions towards physically viable trajectories. In extensive benchmarks across meteorology, turbulence, and fire simulation, RAP not only surpasses state-of-the-art methods but also significantly outperforms a strong \\textbf{analog-only forecasting baseline}. More importantly, RAP generates predictions that are more physically realistic by effectively suppressing error divergence in long-term rollouts.",

We introduce CA-GAN, a novel generative framework specifically engineered to address these challenges for real-world tabular datasets.

This study revisits negative transfer through the lens of causally disentangled learning, emphasizing cross-domain discriminative disagreement on non-causal environmental features as a critical factor. Our theoretical analysis reveals that overreliance on non-causal environmental features as the environment evolves can cause discriminative disagreements~(termed \\emph{environmental disagreement}), thereby resulting in negative transfer. To address this, we propose Reducing Environmental Disagreement~(RED), which disentangles each sample into domain-invariant causal features and domain-specific non-causal environmental features via adversarially training domain-specific environmental feature extractors in the opposite domains. Subsequently, RED estimates and reduces environmental disagreement based on domain-specific non-causal environmental features.

Our framework uniquely synthesizes three key concepts: (1) a generalized loss-based outlyingness measure (PLO) that replaces the fixed metric with flexible, adaptive loss functions like our proposed SVM-like loss; (2) a global kernel PCA stage to linearize non-linear data structures; and (3) a subsequent local clustering stage to handle multi-modal distributions. Comprehensive 5-fold cross-validation experiments on 10 benchmark datasets, with automated hyperparameter optimization, demonstrate that Two-Stage LKPLO achieves state-of-the-art performance. It significantly outperforms strong baselines on datasets with challenging structures where existing methods fail, most notably on multi-cluster data (Optdigits) and complex, high-dimensional data (Arrhythmia). Furthermore, an ablation study empirically confirms that the synergistic combination of both the kernelization and localization stages is indispensable for its superior performance.

In this paper, we address a central challenge of SSL for CO: solving problems with discrete constraints. We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that enables us to solve discrete constrained optimization problems with neural networks. Concretely, we leverage algorithmic techniques from the literature on convex geometry and Carath√©odory's theorem to decompose neural network outputs into convex combinations of polytope corners that correspond to feasible sets. This decomposition-based approach enables self-supervised training but also ensures efficient quality-preserving rounding of the neural net output into feasible solutions. Extensive experiments in cardinality-constrained optimization show that our approach can consistently outperform neural baselines. We further provide worked-out examples of how our method can be applied beyond cardinality-constrained problems to a diverse set of combinatorial optimization tasks, including finding independent sets in graphs, and solving matroid-constrained problems.",

        "summary": "Spatio-Temporal Multivariate time series Forecast (STMF) uses the time series of $n$ spatially distributed variables in a period of recent past to forecast their values in a period of near future. It has important applications in spatio-temporal sensing forecast such as road traffic prediction and air pollution prediction. Recent papers have addressed a practical problem of missing variables in the model input, which arises in the sensing applications where the number $m$ of sensors is far less than the number $n$ of locations to be monitored, due to budget constraints. We observe that the state of the art assumes that the $m$ variables (i.e., locations with sensors) in the model input are pre-determined and the important problem of how to choose the $m$ variables in the input has never been studied. This paper fills the gap by studying a new problem of STMF with chosen variables, which optimally selects $m$-out-of-$n$ variables for the model input in order to maximize the forecast accuracy. We propose a unified framework that jointly performs variable selection and model optimization for both forecast accuracy and model efficiency. It consists of three novel technical components: (1) masked variable-parameter pruning, which progressively prunes less informative variables and attention parameters through quantile-based masking; (2) prioritized variable-parameter replay, which replays low-loss past samples to preserve learned knowledge for model stability; (3) dynamic extrapolation mechanism, which propagates information from variables selected for the input to all other variables via learnable spatial embeddings and adjacency information. Experiments on five real-world datasets show that our work significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness of joint variable selection and model optimization.",

Global sampling ensures stability by covering the entire domain but requires many samples and is computationally expensive, whereas local sampling improves efficiency by focusing on high-residual regions but may neglect well-learned areas, reducing robustness. We propose a Global-Local Fusion (GLF) Sampling Strategy that combines the strengths of both approaches. Specifically, new collocation points are generated by perturbing training points with Gaussian noise scaled inversely to the residual, thereby concentrating samples in difficult regions while preserving exploration. To further reduce computational overhead, a lightweight linear surrogate is introduced to approximate the global residual-based distribution, achieving similar effectiveness at a fraction of the cost. Together, these components, residual-adaptive sampling and residual-based approximation, preserve the stability of global methods while retaining the efficiency of local refinement. Extensive experiments on benchmark PDEs demonstrate that GLF consistently improves both accuracy and efficiency compared with global and local sampling strategies. This study provides a practical and scalable framework for enhancing the reliability and efficiency of PINNs in solving complex and high-dimensional PDEs.",

We validate the model performance on three public functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) datasets, and the results show that it outperforms existing mainstream methods in multiple indicators.

We propose Safe Text embedding Guidance (STG), a training-free approach to improve the safety of diffusion models by guiding the text embeddings during sampling. STG adjusts the text embeddings based on a safety function evaluated on the expected final denoised image, allowing the model to generate safer outputs without additional training. Theoretically, we show that STG aligns the underlying model distribution with safety constraints, thereby achieving safer outputs while minimally affecting generation quality. Experiments on various safety scenarios, including nudity, violence, and artist-style removal, show that STG consistently outperforms both training-based and training-free baselines in removing unsafe content while preserving the core semantic intent of input prompts.

This study introduces a novel method to use Automatic Identification System (AIS) vessel tracking data to predict the number of barges in tow using Machine Learning (ML). To train and test the model, barge instances were manually annotated from satellite scenes across the Lower Mississippi River. Labeled images were matched to AIS vessel tracks using a spatiotemporal matching procedure. A comprehensive set of 30 AIS-derived features capturing vessel geometry, dynamic movement, and trajectory patterns were created and evaluated using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to identify the most predictive variables. Six regression models, including ensemble, kernel-based, and generalized linear approaches, were trained and evaluated. The Poisson Regressor model yielded the best performance, achieving a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.92 barges using 12 of the 30 features. The feature importance analysis revealed that metrics capturing vessel maneuverability such as course entropy, speed variability and trip length were most predictive of barge count. The proposed approach provides a scalable, readily implementable method for enhancing Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), with strong potential applications in lock scheduling, port management, and freight planning. Future work will expand the proof of concept presented here to explore model transferability to other inland rivers with differing operational and environmental conditions.",

Recent deep learning methods provide an efficient approach to address this challenge by iteratively updating neural networks. These methods' performance relies heavily on the spectral distribution of the given operator: larger gaps between the operator's eigenvalues will improve precision, thus tailored spectral transformations that leverage the spectral distribution can enhance their performance. Based on this observation, we propose the Spectral Transformation Network (STNet). During each iteration, STNet uses approximate eigenvalues and eigenfunctions to perform spectral transformations on the original operator, turning it into an equivalent but easier problem. Specifically, we employ deflation projection to exclude the subspace corresponding to already solved eigenfunctions, thereby reducing the search space and avoiding converging to existing eigenfunctions. Additionally, our filter transform magnifies eigenvalues in the desired region and suppresses those outside, further improving performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that STNet consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in accuracy.",

Here, we present SynCast, a high-resolution neural forecasting model that integrates meteorological and air composition data to improve predictions of both average and extreme pollution levels. Built on a regionally adapted transformer backbone and enhanced with a diffusion-based stochastic refinement module, SynCast captures the nonlinear dynamics driving PM spikes more accurately than existing approaches. Leveraging on harmonized ERA5 and CAMS datasets, our model shows substantial gains in forecasting fidelity across multiple PM variables (PM$_1$, PM$_{2.5}$, PM$_{10}$), especially under extreme conditions. We demonstrate that conventional loss functions underrepresent distributional tails (rare pollution events) and show that SynCast, guided by domain-aware objectives and extreme value theory, significantly enhances performance in highly impacted regions without compromising global accuracy.

We implement these metrics with an autorater prompt that enables any capable LLM to compute the legibility and coverage of existing CoTs.

We present these metrics, including our complete autorater prompt, as a tool for developers to track how design decisions impact monitorability. While the exact prompt we share is still a preliminary version under ongoing development, we are sharing it now in the hopes that others in the community will find it useful.

We present ChessQA, a comprehensive benchmark that assesses LLM chess understanding across five task categories (Structural, Motifs, Short Tactics, Position Judgment, and Semantic), which approximately correspond to the ascending abstractions that players master as they accumulate chess knowledge, from understanding basic rules and learning tactical motifs to correctly calculating tactics, evaluating positions, and semantically describing high-level concepts. In this way, ChessQA captures a more comprehensive picture of chess ability and understanding, going significantly beyond the simple move quality evaluations done previously, and offers a controlled, consistent setting for diagnosis and comparison. Furthermore, ChessQA is inherently dynamic, with prompts, answer keys, and construction scripts that can evolve as models improve. Evaluating a range of contemporary LLMs, we find persistent weaknesses across all five categories and provide results and error analyses by category.

To this end, we evaluate the performance of several computer vision models trained under varying privacy levels on a simple classification task, and then analyze the quality of private data reconstructions obtained from the intercepted gradients in a simulated FL environment. Our results demonstrate that DP-SGD significantly mitigates the risk of gradient leakage attacks, albeit with a moderate trade-off in model utility. In contrast, PDP-SGD maintains strong classification performance but proves ineffective as a practical defense against reconstruction attacks.

        "summary": "We study the problem of training neural networks with quantized parameters. Learning low-precision quantized parameters by enabling computation of gradients via the Straight-Through Estimator (STE) can be challenging. While the STE enables back-propagation, which is a first-order method, recent works have explored the use of zeroth-order (ZO) gradient descent for fine-tuning. We note that the STE provides high-quality biased gradients, and ZO gradients are unbiased but can be expensive. We thus propose First-Order-Guided Zeroth-Order Gradient Descent (FOGZO) that reduces STE bias while reducing computations relative to ZO methods. Empirically, we show FOGZO improves the tradeoff between quality and training time in Quantization-Aware Pre-Training. Specifically, versus STE at the same number of iterations, we show a 1-8\\% accuracy improvement for DeiT Tiny/Small, 1-2\\% accuracy improvement on ResNet 18/50, and 1-22 perplexity point improvement for LLaMA models with up to 0.3 billion parameters. For the same loss, FOGZO yields a 796$\\times$ reduction in computation versus n-SPSA for a 2-layer MLP on MNIST. Code is available at https://github.com/1733116199/fogzo.",

In this study, we introduce gCDMI, a novel multi-group causal discovery method that leverages group-level interventions on trained deep neural networks and employs model invariance testing to infer causal relationships. Our approach involves three key steps. First, we use deep learning to jointly model the structural relationships among groups of all time series. Second, we apply group-wise interventions to the trained model. Finally, we conduct model invariance testing to determine the presence of causal links among variable groups. We evaluate our method on simulated datasets, demonstrating its superior performance in identifying group-level causal relationships compared to existing methods. Additionally, we validate our approach on real-world datasets, including brain networks and climate ecosystems. Our results highlight that applying group-level interventions to deep learning models, combined with invariance testing, can effectively reveal complex causal structures, offering valuable insights for domains such as neuroscience and climate science.",

Yet, existing MIP approaches for regression tasks are either limited to purely binary features or become computationally intractable when continuous, large-scale data are involved. Naively binarizing continuous features sacrifices global optimality and often yields needlessly deep trees. We recast the optimal regression-tree training as a two-stage optimization problem and propose Reduced-Space Optimal Regression Trees (RS-ORT) - a specialized branch-and-bound (BB) algorithm that branches exclusively on tree-structural variables. This design guarantees the algorithm's convergence and its independence from the number of training samples. Leveraging the model's structure, we introduce several bound tightening techniques - closed-form leaf prediction, empirical threshold discretization, and exact depth-1 subtree parsing - that combine with decomposable upper and lower bounding strategies to accelerate the training. The BB node-wise decomposition enables trivial parallel execution, further alleviating the computational intractability even for million-size datasets. Based on the empirical studies on several regression benchmarks containing both binary and continuous features, RS-ORT also delivers superior training and testing performance than state-of-the-art methods. Notably, on datasets with up to 2,000,000 samples with continuous features, RS-ORT can obtain guaranteed training performance with a simpler tree structure and a better generalization ability in four hours.",

Traditional maintenance, often based on scheduled inspections, struggles to capture anomalies in multi-dimensional real-time CAN Bus data. This study employs a graph-based feature selection method to analyze relationships among CAN Bus parameters of electric buses and investigates the prediction performance of targeted alarms using artificial intelligence techniques. The raw data collected over two years underwent extensive preprocessing to ensure data quality and consistency. A hybrid graph-based feature selection tool was developed by combining statistical filtering (Pearson correlation, Cramer's V, ANOVA F-test) with optimization-based community detection algorithms (InfoMap, Leiden, Louvain, Fast Greedy). Machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost, were optimized through grid and random search with data balancing via SMOTEEN and binary search-based down-sampling. Model interpretability was achieved using LIME to identify the features influencing predictions. The results demonstrate that the developed system effectively predicts vehicle alarms, enhances feature interpretability, and supports proactive maintenance strategies aligned with Industry 4.0 principles.",

The PDE loss is computed in the full resolution (pixel) space by decoding the latent representation and is designed to enforce physical consistency through a finite-difference approximation of an effective advection-diffusion balance. Empirical observations indicate that conventional diffusion training already yields low PDE residuals, and we investigate how fine-tuning with this additional loss further regularizes the model and enhances the physical plausibility of the generated fields.

While low-rank adaptation (LoRA) effectively curtails this cost by confining the weight updates to a low-dimensional subspace, such a restriction can hinder effectiveness and slow convergence. This contribution deals with these limitations by accumulating progressively a high-rank weight update from consecutive low-rank increments. Specifically, the per update optimal low-rank matrix is identified to minimize the loss function and closely approximate full fine-tuning. To endow efficient and seamless optimization without restarting, this optimal choice is formed by appropriately scaling the columns of the original low-rank matrix. Rigorous performance guarantees reveal that the optimal scaling can be found analytically. Extensive numerical tests with popular LLMs scaling up to 12 billion parameters demonstrate a consistent performance gain and fast convergence relative to state-of-the-art LoRA variants on diverse tasks including natural language understanding, commonsense reasoning, and mathematical problem solving.",

This study tackles such difficulties using the Tennessee Eastman Process, a well-established benchmark known for its intricate dynamics, to develop an innovative fault detection framework. Initial attempts with standard models revealed limitations in both performance and interpretability, prompting a shift toward a more tractable approach. By employing SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), we transform the problem into a more manageable and transparent form, pinpointing the most critical process features driving fault predictions. This reduction in complexity unlocks the ability to apply causal analysis through Directed Acyclic Graphs, generated by multiple algorithms, to uncover the underlying mechanisms of fault propagation. The resulting causal structures align strikingly with SHAP findings, consistently highlighting key process elements-like cooling and separation systems-as pivotal to fault development. Together, these methods not only enhance detection accuracy but also provide operators with clear, actionable insights into fault origins, a synergy that, to our knowledge, has not been previously explored in this context. This dual approach bridges predictive power with causal understanding, offering a robust tool for monitoring complex manufacturing environments and paving the way for smarter, more interpretable fault detection in industrial systems.",

In this study, we introduce a physics-informed operator learning approach by extending the Resolution Independent Neural Operator (RINO) framework to a fully data-free setup, addressing both challenges simultaneously. Here, the arbitrarily (but sufficiently finely) discretized input functions are projected onto a latent embedding space (i.e., a vector space of finite dimensions), using pre-trained basis functions. The operator associated with the underlying partial differential equations (PDEs) is then approximated by a simple multi-layer perceptron (MLP), which takes as input a latent code along with spatiotemporal coordinates to produce the solution in the physical space. The PDEs are enforced via a finite difference solver in the physical space. The validation and performance of the proposed method are benchmarked on several numerical examples with multi-resolution data, where input functions are sampled at varying resolutions, including both coarse and fine discretizations.",

Prior work on binary classification suggests that Adam exhibits a ``richness bias,'' which can help it learn nonlinear decision boundaries closer to the Bayes-optimal decision boundary relative to gradient descent. However, the coordinate-wise preconditioning scheme employed by Adam renders the overall method sensitive to orthogonal transformations of feature space. We show that this sensitivity can manifest as a reversal of Adam's competitive advantage: even small rotations of the underlying data distribution can make Adam forfeit its richness bias and converge to a linear decision boundary that is farther from the Bayes-optimal decision boundary than the one learned by gradient descent. To alleviate this issue, we show that a recently proposed reparameterization method -- which applies an orthogonal transformation to the optimization objective -- endows any first-order method with equivariance to data rotations, and we empirically demonstrate its ability to restore Adam's bias towards rich decision boundaries.",

We train SAEs on audio autoencoder latents, then learn linear mappings from SAE features to discretized acoustic properties (pitch, amplitude, and timbre). This enables both controllable manipulation and analysis of the AI music generation process, revealing how acoustic properties emerge during synthesis.

Here, we systematically compare FuXi-ENS with ECMWF-ENS using all 90 global TCs in 2018, examining their performance in TC-related physical variables, track and intensity forecasts, and the associated dynamical and thermodynamical fields. FuXi-ENS demonstrates clear advantages in predicting TC-related physical variables, and achieves more accurate track forecasts with reduced ensemble spread, though it still underestimates intensity relative to observations.

To test these hypotheses, we compare Cobweb/4V with neural baselines, including CobwebNN, a neural implementation of the Cobweb framework introduced in this work. Experiments on datasets of varying complexity (MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, MedMNIST, and CIFAR-10) show that adaptive restructuring enhances learning plasticity, sparse updates help mitigate interference, and the information-theoretic learning process preserves prior knowledge without revisiting past data.

In this work, we propose a principled framework that mitigates these biases in reward models while preserving the underlying factors that reflect intended preferences. We first provide a formulation of the data-generating process, assuming that the observed data (e.g., text) is generated from both spurious and non-spurious latent variables. We show that, interestingly, these non-spurious latent variables can be theoretically identified from data, regardless of whether a surrogate for the spurious latent variables is available. This further inspires a practical method that uses variational inference to recover these variables and leverages them to train reward models. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively mitigates spurious correlation issues and yields more robust reward models.",

        "summary": "The nonlinear nature of chaotic systems results in extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and highly intricate dynamical behaviors, posing fundamental challenges for accurately predicting their evolution. To overcome the limitation that conventional approaches fail to capture both local features and global dependencies in chaotic time series simultaneously, this study proposes a parallel predictive framework integrating Transformer and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks. The hybrid model employs a dual-branch architecture, where the Transformer branch mainly captures long-range dependencies while the BiLSTM branch focuses on extracting local temporal features. The complementary representations from the two branches are fused in a dedicated feature-fusion layer to enhance predictive accuracy. As illustrating examples, the model's performance is systematically evaluated on two representative tasks in the Lorenz system. The first is autonomous evolution prediction, in which the model recursively extrapolates system trajectories from the time-delay embeddings of the state vector to evaluate long-term tracking accuracy and stability. The second is inference of unmeasured variable, where the model reconstructs the unobserved states from the time-delay embeddings of partial observations to assess its state-completion capability. The results consistently indicate that the proposed hybrid framework outperforms both single-branch architectures across tasks, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness in chaotic system prediction.",

Without architectural safeguards, LLM agents exhibit catastrophic brittleness: identical capabilities produce wildly different outcomes depending solely on prompt framing. We present Chimera, a neuro-symbolic-causal architecture that integrates three complementary components - an LLM strategist, a formally verified symbolic constraint engine, and a causal inference module for counterfactual reasoning. We benchmark Chimera against baseline architectures (LLM-only, LLM with symbolic constraints) across 52-week simulations in a realistic e-commerce environment featuring price elasticity, trust dynamics, and seasonal demand. Under organizational biases toward either volume or margin optimization, LLM-only agents fail catastrophically (total loss of \\$99K in volume scenarios) or destroy brand trust (-48.6% in margin scenarios). Adding symbolic constraints prevents disasters but achieves only 43-87% of Chimera's profit. Chimera consistently delivers the highest returns (\\$1.52M and \\$1.96M respectively, some cases +\\$2.2M) while improving brand trust (+1.8% and +10.8%, some cases +20.86%), demonstrating prompt-agnostic robustness.

        "summary": "Bayesian Optimization is a widely used method for optimizing expensive black-box functions, relying on probabilistic surrogate models such as Gaussian Processes. The quality of the surrogate model is crucial for good optimization performance, especially in the few-shot setting where only a small number of batches of points can be evaluated. In this setting, the initialization plays a critical role in shaping the surrogate's predictive quality and guiding subsequent optimization. Despite this, practitioners typically rely on (quasi-)random designs to cover the input space. However, such approaches neglect two key factors: (a) space-filling designs may not be desirable to reduce predictive uncertainty, and (b) efficient hyperparameter learning during initialization is essential for high-quality prediction, which may conflict with space-filling designs. To address these limitations, we propose Hyperparameter-Informed Predictive Exploration (HIPE), a novel acquisition strategy that balances predictive uncertainty reduction with hyperparameter learning using information-theoretic principles. We derive a closed-form expression for HIPE in the Gaussian Process setting and demonstrate its effectiveness through extensive experiments in active learning and few-shot BO. Our results show that HIPE outperforms standard initialization strategies in terms of predictive accuracy, hyperparameter identification, and subsequent optimization performance, particularly in large-batch, few-shot settings relevant to many real-world Bayesian Optimization applications.",

To address these challenges, we propose a simple yet effective Decomposition-Based Loss function called DBLoss. This method uses exponential moving averages to decompose the time series into seasonal and trend components within the forecasting horizon, and then calculates the loss for each of these components separately, followed by weighting them. As a general loss function, DBLoss can be combined with any deep learning forecasting model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DBLoss significantly improves the performance of state-of-the-art models across diverse real-world datasets and provides a new perspective on the design of time series loss functions.",

Previous work has explored how dense models use \\textit{superposition} to represent more features than dimensions, and how superposition is a function of feature sparsity and feature importance. MoE models cannot be explained mechanistically through the same lens. We find that neither feature sparsity nor feature importance cause discontinuous phase changes, and that network sparsity (the ratio of active to total experts) better characterizes MoEs. We develop new metrics for measuring superposition across experts. Our findings demonstrate that models with greater network sparsity exhibit greater \\emph{monosemanticity}. We propose a new definition of expert specialization based on monosemantic feature representation rather than load balancing, showing that experts naturally organize around coherent feature combinations when initialized appropriately. These results suggest that network sparsity in MoEs may enable more interpretable models without sacrificing performance, challenging the common assumption that interpretability and capability are fundamentally at odds.",

STL first decomposes the original time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components. Then, a Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network models long term trends, an Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model captures seasonal periodicity, and an Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm predicts nonlinear residual fluctuations.

Using 998 traffic flow records from a New York City intersection between November and December 2015, results show that the LSTM ARIMA XGBoost hybrid model significantly outperforms standalone models including LSTM, ARIMA, and XGBoost across MAE, RMSE, and R squared metrics.

The model fuses wavelet time-frequency representations with transformer attention over meteorology, vegetation indices, topography, and land cover. On 2024 OCO-2 data, ST-ViWT attains R2 = 0.984 and RMSE = 0.468 ppm; 92.3 percent of gap-filled predictions lie within +/-1 ppm. Independent validation with TCCON shows robust generalization (bias = -0.14 ppm; r = 0.928), including faithful reproduction of the late-summer drawdown. Spatial analysis across 14 poultry regions reveals a moderate positive association between facility density and XCO2 (r = 0.43); high-density areas exhibit larger seasonal amplitudes (9.57 ppm) and enhanced summer variability. Compared with conventional interpolation and standard machine-learning baselines, ST-ViWT yields seamless 0.25 degree CO2 surfaces with explicit uncertainties, enabling year-round coverage despite sparse observations. The approach supports integration of satellite constraints with national inventories and precision livestock platforms to benchmark emissions, refine region-specific factors, and verify interventions.

While deep learning, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), has shown promise in medical image analysis for pneumonia detection, CNNs often suffer from high computational costs, limitations in feature representation, and challenges in generalizing from smaller datasets. To address these limitations, we explore the application of Quanvolutional Neural Networks (QNNs), leveraging quantum computing for enhanced feature extraction. This paper introduces a novel hybrid quantum-classical model for pneumonia detection using the PneumoniaMNIST dataset. Our approach utilizes a quanvolutional layer with a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC) to process 2x2 image patches, employing rotational Y-gates for data encoding and entangling layers to generate non-classical feature representations. These quantum-extracted features are then fed into a classical neural network for classification. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed QNN achieves a higher validation accuracy of 83.33 percent compared to a comparable classical CNN which achieves 73.33 percent. This enhanced convergence and sample efficiency highlight the potential of QNNs for medical image analysis, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data.

        "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) play a significant role in an increasing body of research on traffic forecasting due to their effectively capturing spatiotemporal patterns embedded in traffic data. A general assumption of training the said forecasting models via mean squared error estimation is that the errors across time steps and spatial positions are uncorrelated. However, this assumption does not really hold because of the autocorrelation caused by both the temporality and spatiality of traffic data. This gap limits the performance of DNN-based forecasting models and is overlooked by current studies. To fill up this gap, this paper proposes Spatiotemporally Autocorrelated Error Adjustment (SAEA), a novel and general framework designed to systematically adjust autocorrelated prediction errors in traffic forecasting. Unlike existing approaches that assume prediction errors follow a random Gaussian noise distribution, SAEA models these errors as a spatiotemporal vector autoregressive (VAR) process to capture their intrinsic dependencies. First, it explicitly captures both spatial and temporal error correlations by a coefficient matrix, which is then embedded into a newly formulated cost function. Second, a structurally sparse regularization is introduced to incorporate prior spatial information, ensuring that the learned coefficient matrix aligns with the inherent road network structure. Finally, an inference process with test-time error adjustment is designed to dynamically refine predictions, mitigating the impact of autocorrelated errors in real-time forecasting. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is verified on different traffic datasets. Results across a wide range of traffic forecasting models show that our method enhances performance in almost all cases.",

To this end, layer pruning has been proposed to reduce the computational overhead by directly removing redundant layers. However, existing layer pruning methods typically rely on hand-crafted metrics to evaluate and remove individual layers, while ignoring the dependencies between layers. This can disrupt the model's information flow and severely degrade performance. To address these issues, we propose CLP, a novel continuous layer pruning framework that introduces two key innovations: a differentiable concave gate algorithm that automatically identifies the best continuous layer segments for pruning via gradient-based optimization; and a cutoff endpoint tuning strategy that effectively restores model performance by fine-tuning only the layers adjacent to the pruned segments. Extensive experiments across multiple model architectures (including LLaMA2, LLaMA3 and Qwen) and sizes (from $7$B to $70$B parameters) show that CLP significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines. For example, at a pruning rate of $20\\%$, CLP achieves an average performance retention of $95.34\\%$ on LLaMA3-70B, outperforming baselines by $4.29\\%$-$30.52\\%$.

        "summary": "As the length of input text grows, the key-value (KV) cache in LLMs imposes prohibitive GPU memory costs and limits long-context inference on resource constrained devices. Existing approaches, such as KV quantization and pruning, reduce memory usage but suffer from numerical precision loss or suboptimal retention of key-value pairs. We introduce Low Rank Query and Key attention (LRQK), a two-stage framework that jointly decomposes the full-precision query and key matrices into compact rank-\\(r\\) factors during the prefill stage, and then uses these low-dimensional projections to compute proxy attention scores in \\(\\mathcal{O}(lr)\\) time at each decode step. By selecting only the top-\\(k\\) tokens and a small fixed set of recent tokens, LRQK employs a mixed GPU-CPU cache with a hit-and-miss mechanism that transfers only missing full-precision KV pairs, thereby preserving exact attention outputs while reducing CPU-GPU data movement. Extensive experiments on the RULER and LongBench benchmarks with LLaMA-3-8B and Qwen2.5-7B demonstrate that LRQK matches or surpasses leading sparse-attention methods in long context settings, while delivering significant memory savings with minimal loss in accuracy.

The quadratic complexity of transformer models demands substantial resources and increases latency during inference.

Our method incorporates spatially aware partitioning of particles based on kinematic features, thereby computing attention between regions of physical significance. Additionally, we employ convolutional layers to capture local correlations, informed by insights from jet physics. In addition to outperforming the standard linformer in jet classification tasks, SAL-T also achieves classification results comparable to full-attention transformers, while using considerably fewer resources with lower latency during inference. Experiments on a generic point cloud classification dataset (ModelNet10) further confirm this trend. Our code is available at https://github.com/aaronw5/SAL-T4HEP.",

To mitigate modality collapse caused by naive fusion, we introduce a Progressive Injection (PI) mechanism that asymmetrically integrates this prior into the sequence stream, preserving modality-specific modeling while enabling cross-modal enrichment. Built on a state space backbone, MuMo supports long-range dependency modeling and robust information propagation. Across 29 benchmark tasks from Therapeutics Data Commons (TDC) and MoleculeNet, MuMo achieves an average improvement of 2.7% over the best-performing baseline on each task, ranking first on 22 of them, including a 27% improvement on the LD50 task.

LLMCOMP first quantizes 3D fields into discrete tokens, arranges them via Z-order curves to preserve locality, and applies coverage-guided sampling to enhance training efficiency. An autoregressive transformer is then trained with spatial-temporal embeddings to model token transitions. During compression, the model performs top-k prediction, storing only rank indices and fallback corrections to ensure strict error bounds. Experiments on multiple reanalysis datasets show that LLMCOMP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art compressors, achieving up to 30% higher compression ratios under strict error bounds. These results highlight the potential of LLMs as general-purpose compressors for high-fidelity scientific data.",

We propose Ranked Choice Preference Optimization (RCPO), a unified framework that bridges preference optimization with (ranked) choice modeling via maximum likelihood estimation. The framework is flexible, supporting both utility-based and rank-based choice models. It subsumes several existing pairwise methods (e.g., DPO, SimPO), while providing principled training objectives for richer feedback formats. We instantiate this framework with two representative ranked choice models (Multinomial Logit and Mallows-RMJ). Empirical studies on Llama-3-8B-Instruct and Gemma-2-9B-it across AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard benchmarks show that RCPO consistently outperforms competitive baselines. RCPO shows how directly leveraging ranked preference data, combined with the right choice models, yields more effective alignment.

Recent efforts increasingly turn to code as a rich training source, given its inherent logical structure and diverse reasoning paradigms such as divide-and-conquer, topological ordering, and enumeration. However, reasoning in code is often expressed implicitly and entangled with syntactic or implementation noise, making direct training on raw code suboptimal.To address this, we introduce TracePile, a large-scale corpus of 2.6 million samples that transforms code execution into explicit, step-by-step chain-of-thought-style rationales, which we call Chain of Execution (CoE). The corpus spans domains including mathematics, classical algorithms and algorithmic competition, and is enriched with variable-tracing questions and code rewritings to enhance logical granularity and code diversity. We evaluate TracePile using three training setups: continue-pretraining, instruction tuning after pretraining, and two-stage finetuning. Experiments across four base models (LLaMA 3, LLaMA 3.1, Qwen-2.5, and Qwen-2.5 Coder) and 20 benchmarks covering math, code, logic, and algorithms demonstrate consistent improvements.

DiNo measures cophenetic distances via the most recent common ancestor of observation pairs, while RanBu applies kernel smoothing to Breiman's classical proximity measure. Both approaches operate entirely after forest training: no additional trees are grown, and tuning of the single bandwidth parameter $h$ requires only lightweight matrix-vector operations. Across three synthetic benchmarks and 25 public datasets, RanBu matches or exceeds the accuracy of full-depth random forests-particularly in high-noise settings-while reducing training plus inference time by up to 95\\%. DiNo achieves the best bias-variance trade-off in low-noise regimes at a modest computational cost. Both methods extend directly to quantile regression, maintaining accuracy with substantial speed gains.

For SO(3)-equivariant models such as MACE, there is little systematic evidence on whether reduced-precision arithmetic and GPU-optimized kernels can cut this cost without harming physical fidelity. This thesis aims to make MACE cheaper and faster while preserving accuracy by identifying computational bottlenecks and evaluating low-precision execution policies. We profile MACE end-to-end and per block, compare the e3nn and NVIDIA cuEquivariance backends, and assess FP64/FP32/BF16/FP16 settings (with FP32 accumulation) for inference, short NVT and long NPT water simulations, and toy training runs under reproducible, steady-state timing. cuEquivariance reduces inference latency by about $3\\times$. Casting only linear layers to BF16/FP16 within an FP32 model yields roughly 4x additional speedups, while energies and thermodynamic observables in NVT/NPT MD remain within run-to-run variability. Half-precision weights during training degrade force RMSE. Mixing e3nn and cuEq modules without explicit adapters causes representation mismatches. Fused equivariant kernels and mixed-precision inference can substantially accelerate state-of-the-art force fields with negligible impact on downstream MD. A practical policy is to use cuEquivariance with FP32 by default and enable BF16/FP16 for linear layers (keeping FP32 accumulations) for maximum throughput, while training remains in FP32. Further gains are expected on Ampere/Hopper GPUs (TF32/BF16) and from kernel-level FP16/BF16 paths and pipeline fusion.",

In camera-guided video generation with a predefined camera trajectory, this limitation leads to collisions with the generated scene, after which autoregression quickly collapses. To address this, we propose Generative View Stitching (GVS), which samples the entire sequence in parallel such that the generated scene is faithful to every part of the predefined camera trajectory. Our main contribution is a sampling algorithm that extends prior work on diffusion stitching for robot planning to video generation. While such stitching methods usually require a specially trained model, GVS is compatible with any off-the-shelf video model trained with Diffusion Forcing, a prevalent sequence diffusion framework that we show already provides the affordances necessary for stitching. We then introduce Omni Guidance, a technique that enhances the temporal consistency in stitching by conditioning on both the past and future, and that enables our proposed loop-closing mechanism for delivering long-range coherence. Overall, GVS achieves camera-guided video generation that is stable, collision-free, frame-to-frame consistent, and closes loops for a variety of predefined camera paths, including Oscar Reutersv√§rd's Impossible Staircase.

While prior work often imposes object-centric attention (e.g., Slot Attention) explicitly to probe these benefits, it remains unclear whether this ability naturally emerges in pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs). Intuitively, they could: recognizing which patches belong to the same object should be useful for downstream prediction and thus guide attention. Motivated by the quadratic nature of self-attention, we hypothesize that ViTs represent whether two patches belong to the same object, a property we term IsSameObject. We decode IsSameObject from patch embeddings across ViT layers using a similarity probe, which reaches over 90% accuracy. Crucially, this object-binding capability emerges reliably in self-supervised ViTs (DINO, MAE, CLIP), but markedly weaker in ImageNet-supervised models, suggesting that binding is not a trivial architectural artifact, but an ability acquired through specific pretraining objectives. We further discover that IsSameObject is encoded in a low-dimensional subspace on top of object features, and that this signal actively guides attention. Ablating IsSameObject from model activations degrades downstream performance and works against the learning objective, implying that emergent object binding naturally serves the pretraining objective. Our findings challenge the view that ViTs lack object binding and highlight how symbolic knowledge of \"which parts belong together\" emerges naturally in a connectionist system.",

        "summary": "For three decades statistical physics has been providing a framework to analyse neural networks. A long-standing question remained on its capacity to tackle deep learning models capturing rich feature learning effects, thus going beyond the narrow networks or kernel methods analysed until now. We positively answer through the study of the supervised learning of a multi-layer perceptron. Importantly, (i) its width scales as the input dimension, making it more prone to feature learning than ultra wide networks, and more expressive than narrow ones or with fixed embedding layers; and (ii) we focus on the challenging interpolation regime where the number of trainable parameters and data are comparable, which forces the model to adapt to the task. We consider the matched teacher-student setting. It provides the fundamental limits of learning random deep neural network targets and helps in identifying the sufficient statistics describing what is learnt by an optimally trained network as the data budget increases. A rich phenomenology emerges with various learning transitions. With enough data optimal performance is attained through model's \"specialisation\" towards the target, but it can be hard to reach for training algorithms which get attracted by sub-optimal solutions predicted by the theory. Specialisation occurs inhomogeneously across layers, propagating from shallow towards deep ones, but also across neurons in each layer. Furthermore, deeper targets are harder to learn. Despite its simplicity, the Bayesian-optimal setting provides insights on how the depth, non-linearity and finite (proportional) width influence neural networks in the feature learning regime that are potentially relevant way beyond it.",

        "summary": "Neural networks have become a popular tool in predictive modelling, more commonly associated with machine learning and artificial intelligence than with statistics. Generalised Additive Models (GAMs) are flexible non-linear statistical models that retain interpretability. Both are state-of-the-art in their own right, with their respective advantages and disadvantages. This paper analyses how these two model classes have performed on real-world tabular data. Following PRISMA guidelines, we conducted a systematic review of papers that performed empirical comparisons of GAMs and neural networks. Eligible papers were identified, yielding 143 papers, with 430 datasets. Key attributes at both paper and dataset levels were extracted and reported. Beyond summarising comparisons, we analyse reported performance metrics using mixed-effects modelling to investigate potential characteristics that can explain and quantify observed differences, including application area, study year, sample size, number of predictors, and neural network complexity. Across datasets, no consistent evidence of superiority was found for either GAMs or neural networks when considering the most frequently reported metrics (RMSE, $R^2$, and AUC). Neural networks tended to outperform in larger datasets and in those with more predictors, but this advantage narrowed over time. Conversely, GAMs remained competitive, particularly in smaller data settings, while retaining interpretability. Reporting of dataset characteristics and neural network complexity was incomplete in much of the literature, limiting transparency and reproducibility. This review highlights that GAMs and neural networks should be viewed as complementary approaches rather than competitors. For many tabular applications, the performance trade-off is modest, and interpretability may favour GAMs.",

Boundary conditions can be enforced either weakly by penalizing deviations in the loss function or strongly by training a solution structure that inherently matches the prescribed values and derivatives. The former approach is easy to implement but the latter can provide benefits with respect to accuracy and training times. However, previous approaches to strongly enforcing Neumann or Robin boundary conditions require a domain with a fully $C^1$ boundary and, as we demonstrate, can lead to instability if those boundary conditions are posed on a segment of the boundary that is piecewise $C^1$ but only $C^0$ globally. We introduce a generalization of the approach by Sukumar \\& Srivastava (doi: 10.1016/j.cma.2021.114333), and a new approach based on orthogonal projections that overcome this limitation. The performance of these new techniques is compared against weakly and semi-weakly enforced boundary conditions for the scalar Darcy flow equation and the stationary Navier-Stokes equations.",

        "summary": "Despite the popularity of reinforcement learning (RL) in wireless networks, existing approaches that rely on model-free RL (MFRL) and model-based RL (MBRL) are data inefficient and short-sighted. Such RL-based solutions cannot generalize to novel network states since they capture only statistical patterns rather than the underlying physics and logic from wireless data. These limitations become particularly challenging in complex wireless networks with high dynamics and long-term planning requirements. To address these limitations, in this paper, a novel dual-mind world model-based learning framework is proposed with the goal of optimizing completeness-weighted age of information (CAoI) in a challenging mmWave V2X scenario. Inspired by cognitive psychology, the proposed dual-mind world model encompasses a pattern-driven System 1 component and a logic-driven System 2 component to learn dynamics and logic of the wireless network, and to provide long-term link scheduling over reliable imagined trajectories. Link scheduling is learned through end-to-end differentiable imagined trajectories with logical consistency over an extended horizon rather than relying on wireless data obtained from environment interactions. Moreover, through imagination rollouts, the proposed world model can jointly reason network states and plan link scheduling. During intervals without observations, the proposed method remains capable of making efficient decisions. Extensive experiments are conducted on a realistic simulator based on Sionna with real-world physical channel, ray-tracing, and scene objects with material properties. Simulation results show that the proposed world model achieves a significant improvement in data efficiency and achieves strong generalization and adaptation to unseen environments, compared to the state-of-the-art RL baselines, and the world model approach with only System 1.",

        "summary": "Neutron irradiation produces, within a few picoseconds, displacement cascades that are sequences of atomic collisions generating point and extended defects which subsequently affects the long-term evolution of materials. The diversity of these defects, characterized morphologically and statistically, defines what is called the \"primary damage\". In this work, we present a fully unsupervised machine learning (ML) workflow that detects and classifies these defects directly from molecular dynamics data. Local environments are encoded by the Smooth Overlap of Atomic Positions (SOAP) vector, anomalous atoms are isolated with autoencoder neural networks (AE), embedded with Uniform Man- ifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) and clustered using Hierarchical Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (HDBSCAN). Applied to 80 keV displacement cascades in Ni, Fe70Ni10Cr20, and Zr, the AE successfully identify the small fraction of outlier atoms that participate in defect formation. HDBSCAN then partitions the UMAP latent space of AE-flagged SOAP de- scriptors into well defined groups representing vacancy- and interstitial-dominated regions and, within each, separates small from large aggregates, assigning 99.7 % of outliers to compact physical motifs. A signed cluster-identification score confirms this separation, and cluster size scales with net defect counts (R2 > 0.89). Statistical cross analyses between the ML outlier map and several conventional detectors (centrosymmetry, dislocation extraction, etc.) reveal strong overlap and complementary coverage, all achieved without template or threshold tuning. This ML workflow thus provides an efficient tool for the quantitative mapping of structural anomalies in materials, particularly those arising from irradiation damage in displacement cascades.",

        "summary": "The theory of training deep networks has become a central question of modern machine learning and has inspired many practical advancements. In particular, the gradient descent (GD) optimization algorithm has been extensively studied in recent years. A key assumption about GD has appeared in several recent works: the \\emph{GD map is non-singular} -- it preserves sets of measure zero under preimages. Crucially, this assumption has been used to prove that GD avoids saddle points and maxima, and to establish the existence of a computable quantity that determines the convergence to global minima (both for GD and stochastic GD). However, the current literature either assumes the non-singularity of the GD map or imposes restrictive assumptions, such as Lipschitz smoothness of the loss (for example, Lipschitzness does not hold for deep ReLU networks with the cross-entropy loss) and restricts the analysis to GD with small step-sizes. In this paper, we investigate the neural network map as a function on the space of weights and biases. We also prove, for the first time, the non-singularity of the gradient descent (GD) map on the loss landscape of realistic neural network architectures (with fully connected, convolutional, or softmax attention layers) and piecewise analytic activations (which includes sigmoid, ReLU, leaky ReLU, etc.) for almost all step-sizes. Our work significantly extends the existing results on the convergence of GD and SGD by guaranteeing that they apply to practical neural network settings and has the potential to unlock further exploration of learning dynamics.",

Two unique challenges stand out: (1) efficiently and accurately forecasting time series or detecting anomalies in large volumes automatically; and (2) ensuring interpretability of results to effectively incorporate business insights. We present ARIMA_PLUS, a novel framework to overcome these two challenges by a unique combination of (a) accurate and interpretable time series models and (b) scalable and fully managed system infrastructure. The model has a sequential and modular structure to handle different components of the time series, including holiday effects, seasonality, trend, and anomalies, which enables high interpretability of the results. Novel enhancements are made to each module, and a unified framework is established to address both forecasting and anomaly detection tasks simultaneously. In terms of accuracy, its comprehensive benchmark on the 42 public datasets in the Monash forecasting repository shows superior performance over not only well-established statistical alternatives (such as ETS, ARIMA, TBATS, Prophet) but also newer neural network models (such as DeepAR, N-BEATS, PatchTST, TimeMixer). In terms of infrastructure, it is directly built into the query engine of BigQuery in Google Cloud. It uses a simple SQL interface and automates tedious technicalities such as data cleaning and model selection. It automatically scales with managed cloud computational and storage resources, making it possible to forecast 100 million time series using only 1.5 hours with a throughput of more than 18000 time series per second. In terms of interpretability, we present several case studies to demonstrate time series insights it generates and customizability it offers.",

Our approach is motivated by differential cryptanalysis and reconstructs the PUF key bit-by-bit by observing the change in model accuracy, and eventually recovering the BNN model parameters. Evaluated on a BNN trained on the MNIST dataset, our attack could recover 85% of the PUF key, and recover the BNN model up to 93% classification accuracy compared to the original model's 96% accuracy. Our attack is very efficient and it takes a couple of minutes to recovery the PUF key and the model parameters.",

        "summary": "Hypotension in critically ill ICU patients is common and life-threatening. Escalation to catecholamine therapy marks a key management step, with both undertreatment and overtreatment posing risks. Most machine learning (ML) models predict hypotension using fixed MAP thresholds or MAP forecasting, overlooking the clinical decision behind treatment escalation. Predicting catecholamine initiation, the start of vasoactive or inotropic agent administration offers a more clinically actionable target reflecting real decision-making. Using the MIMIC-III database, we modeled catecholamine initiation as a binary event within a 15-minute prediction window. Input features included statistical descriptors from a two-hour sliding MAP context window, along with demographics, biometrics, comorbidities, and ongoing treatments. An Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model was trained and interpreted via SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The model achieved an AUROC of 0.822 (0.813-0.830), outperforming the hypotension baseline (MAP < 65, AUROC 0.686 [0.675-0.699]). SHAP analysis highlighted recent MAP values, MAP trends, and ongoing treatments (e.g., sedatives, electrolytes) as dominant predictors. Subgroup analysis showed higher performance in males, younger patients (<53 years), those with higher BMI (>32), and patients without comorbidities or concurrent medications. Predicting catecholamine initiation based on MAP dynamics, treatment context, and patient characteristics supports the critical decision of when to escalate therapy, shifting focus from threshold-based alarms to actionable decision support. This approach is feasible across a broad ICU cohort under natural event imbalance. Future work should enrich temporal and physiological context, extend label definitions to include therapy escalation, and benchmark against existing hypotension prediction systems.",

        "summary": "Data augmentation using generative models has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing performance in computer vision tasks. However, most existing augmentation approaches primarily focus on optimizing intrinsic data attributes -- such as fidelity and diversity -- to generate visually high-quality synthetic data, while often neglecting task-specific requirements. Yet, it is essential for data generators to account for the needs of downstream tasks, as training data requirements can vary significantly across different tasks and network architectures. To address these limitations, we propose UtilGen, a novel utility-centric data augmentation framework that adaptively optimizes the data generation process to produce task-specific, high-utility training data via downstream task feedback. Specifically, we first introduce a weight allocation network to evaluate the task-specific utility of each synthetic sample. Guided by these evaluations, UtilGen iteratively refines the data generation process using a dual-level optimization strategy to maximize the synthetic data utility: (1) model-level optimization tailors the generative model to the downstream task, and (2) instance-level optimization adjusts generation policies -- such as prompt embeddings and initial noise -- at each generation round. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets of varying complexity and granularity demonstrate that UtilGen consistently achieves superior performance, with an average accuracy improvement of 3.87% over previous SOTA. Further analysis of data influence and distribution reveals that UtilGen produces more impactful and task-relevant synthetic data, validating the effectiveness of the paradigm shift from visual characteristics-centric to task utility-centric data augmentation.",

        "summary": "Understanding and forecasting precipitation events in the Arctic maritime environments, such as Bear Island and Ny-√Ölesund, is crucial for assessing climate risk and developing early warning systems in vulnerable marine regions. This study proposes a probabilistic machine learning framework for modeling and predicting the dynamics and severity of precipitation. We begin by analyzing the scale-dependent relationships between precipitation and key atmospheric drivers (e.g., temperature, relative humidity, cloud cover, and air pressure) using wavelet coherence, which captures localized dependencies across time and frequency domains. To assess joint causal influences, we employ Synergistic-Unique-Redundant Decomposition, which quantifies the impact of interaction effects among each variable on future precipitation dynamics. These insights inform the development of data-driven forecasting models that incorporate both historical precipitation and causal climate drivers. To account for uncertainty, we employ the conformal prediction method, which enables the generation of calibrated non-parametric prediction intervals. Our results underscore the importance of utilizing a comprehensive framework that combines causal analysis with probabilistic forecasting to enhance the reliability and interpretability of precipitation predictions in Arctic marine environments.",

We propose Grace, a satellite-ground collaborative system designed for near-realtime LVLM inference in RS tasks. Accordingly, we deploy compact LVLM on satellites for realtime inference, but larger ones on ground stations (GSs) to guarantee end-to-end performance. Grace is comprised of two main phases that are asynchronous satellite-GS Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and a task dispatch algorithm. Firstly, we still the knowledge archive of GS RAG to satellite archive with tailored adaptive update algorithm during limited satellite-ground data exchange period. Secondly, propose a confidence-based test algorithm that either processes the task onboard the satellite or offloads it to the GS. Extensive experiments based on real-world satellite orbital data show that Grace reduces the average latency by 76-95% compared to state-of-the-art methods, without compromising inference accuracy.",

        "summary": "Behavioral cloning is a simple yet effective technique for learning sequential decision-making from demonstrations. Recently, it has gained prominence as the core of foundation models for the physical world, where achieving generalization requires countless demonstrations of a multitude of tasks. Typically, a human expert with full information on the task demonstrates a (nearly) optimal behavior. In this paper, we propose to hide some of the task's information from the demonstrator. This ``blindfolded'' expert is compelled to employ non-trivial exploration to solve the task. We show that cloning the blindfolded expert generalizes better to unseen tasks than its fully-informed counterpart. We conduct experiments of real-world robot peg insertion tasks with (limited) human demonstrations, alongside videogames from the Procgen benchmark. Additionally, we support our findings with theoretical analysis, which confirms that the generalization error scales with $\\sqrt{I/m}$, where $I$ measures the amount of task information available to the demonstrator, and $m$ is the number of demonstrated tasks. Both theory and practice indicate that cloning blindfolded experts generalizes better with fewer demonstrated tasks.

However, estimating stellar masses in star-forming regions is challenging because young stars are obscured by dense gas and the regions are highly inhomogeneous, making spherical dynamical estimates unreliable. Supervised machine learning could link such complex structures to stellar mass, but it requires large, high-quality labeled datasets from high-resolution magneto-hydrodynamical (MHD) simulations, which are computationally expensive. We address this by pretraining a vision transformer on one million synthetic fractal images using the self-supervised framework DINOv2, and then applying the frozen model to limited high-resolution MHD simulations. Our results demonstrate that synthetic pretraining improves frozen-feature regression stellar mass predictions, with the pretrained model performing slightly better than a supervised model trained on the same limited simulations. Principal component analysis of the extracted features further reveals semantically meaningful structures, suggesting that the model enables unsupervised segmentation of star-forming regions without the need for labeled data or fine-tuning.",

These memory-driven transfers inflate tail latency andviolate Service Level Agreements (SLAs) across k-ary n-cube base-line NoI topologies. To address this gap we introduce an InterferenceScore (IS) that quantifies worst-case slowdown under contention.We then formulate NoI synthesis as a multi-objective optimization(MOO) problem. We develop PARL (Partition-Aware ReinforcementLearner), a topology generator that balances throughput, latency,and power. PARL-generated topologies reduce contention at the memory cut, meet SLAs, and cut worst-case slowdown to 1.2 times while maintaining competitive mean throughput relative to link-rich meshes.

        "summary": "The visual representation of a pre-trained model prioritizes the classifiability on downstream tasks, while the widespread applications for pre-trained visual models have posed new requirements for representation interpretability. However, it remains unclear whether the pre-trained representations can achieve high interpretability and classifiability simultaneously. To answer this question, we quantify the representation interpretability by leveraging its correlation with the ratio of interpretable semantics within the representations. Given the pre-trained representations, only the interpretable semantics can be captured by interpretations, whereas the uninterpretable part leads to information loss. Based on this fact, we propose the Inherent Interpretability Score (IIS) that evaluates the information loss, measures the ratio of interpretable semantics, and quantifies the representation interpretability. In the evaluation of the representation interpretability with different classifiability, we surprisingly discover that the interpretability and classifiability are positively correlated, i.e., representations with higher classifiability provide more interpretable semantics that can be captured in the interpretations. This observation further supports two benefits to the pre-trained representations. First, the classifiability of representations can be further improved by fine-tuning with interpretability maximization. Second, with the classifiability improvement for the representations, we obtain predictions based on their interpretations with less accuracy degradation. The discovered positive correlation and corresponding applications show that practitioners can unify the improvements in interpretability and classifiability for pre-trained vision models.

We address this gap by introducing the Copula-Stein Discrepancy (CSD), a novel class of discrepancies tailored to the geometry of statistical dependence. By defining a Stein operator directly on the copula density, CSD leverages the generative structure of dependence, rather than relying on the joint density's score function. For the broad class of Archimedean copulas, this approach yields a closed-form Stein kernel derived from the scalar generator function. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis, proving that CSD (i) metrizes weak convergence of copula distributions, ensuring it detects any mismatch in dependence; (ii) has an empirical estimator that converges at the minimax optimal rate of $O_P(n^{-1/2})$; and (iii) is provably sensitive to differences in tail dependence coefficients. The framework is extended to general non-Archimedean copulas, including elliptical and vine copulas. Computationally, the exact CSD kernel evaluation scales linearly in dimension, while a novel random feature approximation reduces the $n$-dependence from quadratic $O(n^2)$ to near-linear $\\tilde{O}(n)$, making CSD a practical and theoretically principled tool for dependence-aware inference.",

Among PEFT paradigms, sparse tuning achieves remarkable performance by adjusting only the weights most relevant to downstream tasks, rather than densely tuning the entire weight matrix. Current methods follow a two-stage paradigm. First, it locates task-relevant weights by gradient information, which overlooks the parameter adjustments during fine-tuning and limits the performance. Second, it updates only the located weights by applying a sparse mask to the gradient of the weight matrix, which results in high memory usage due to the storage of all weight matrices in the optimizer. In this paper, we propose a one-stage method named SNELLA to overcome the above limitations. For memory usage, SNELLA selectively updates the weight matrix by adding it to another sparse matrix that is merged by two low-rank learnable matrices. We extend the low-rank decomposition by introducing nonlinear kernel functions, thereby increasing the rank of the resulting merged matrix to prevent the interdependency among weight updates, enabling better adaptation to downstream tasks. For locating task-relevant weights, we propose an adaptive bi-level sparsity allocation mechanism that encourages weights to compete across and inside layers based on their importance scores in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments are conducted on classification, segmentation, and generation tasks using different pre-trained vision models. The results show that SNELLA achieves SOTA performance with low memory usage. Notably, SNELLA obtains 1.8% (91.9% v.s. 90.1%) higher Top-1 accuracy on the FGVC benchmark compared to SPT-LoRA. Compared to previous methods, SNELLA achieves a memory reduction of 31.1%-39.9% across models with parameter scales from 86M to 632M.

        "summary": "Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs) are a class of neurons in the brains of vertebrates that encode environmental boundaries at specific distances and allocentric directions, playing a central role in forming place fields in the hippocampus. Most computational BVC models are restricted to two-dimensional (2D) environments, making them prone to spatial ambiguities in the presence of horizontal symmetries in the environment. To address this limitation, we incorporate vertical angular sensitivity into the BVC framework, thereby enabling robust boundary detection in three dimensions, and leading to significantly more accurate spatial localization in a biologically-inspired robot model. The proposed model processes LiDAR data to capture vertical contours, thereby disambiguating locations that would be indistinguishable under a purely 2D representation. Experimental results show that in environments with minimal vertical variation, the proposed 3D model matches the performance of a 2D baseline; yet, as 3D complexity increases, it yields substantially more distinct place fields and markedly reduces spatial aliasing. These findings show that adding a vertical dimension to BVC-based localization can significantly enhance navigation and mapping in real-world 3D spaces while retaining performance parity in simpler, near-planar scenarios.",

We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT) problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited resources when effectively configured.",

While such models have gained significant attention in fields like Earth Observation, their application to Mars science remains limited. A key enabler of progress in other domains has been the availability of standardized benchmarks that support systematic evaluation. In contrast, Mars science lacks such benchmarks and standardized evaluation frameworks, which have limited progress toward developing foundation models for Martian tasks. To address this gap, we introduce Mars-Bench, the first benchmark designed to systematically evaluate models across a broad range of Mars-related tasks using both orbital and surface imagery. Mars-Bench comprises 20 datasets spanning classification, segmentation, and object detection, focused on key geologic features such as craters, cones, boulders, and frost. We provide standardized, ready-to-use datasets and baseline evaluations using models pre-trained on natural images, Earth satellite data, and state-of-the-art vision-language models. Results from all analyses suggest that Mars-specific foundation models may offer advantages over general-domain counterparts, motivating further exploration of domain-adapted pre-training. Mars-Bench aims to establish a standardized foundation for developing and comparing machine learning models for Mars science.

This simple modification recovers consistent ordinal alignment under mild assumptions and achieves the first polynomial finite-sample error bounds in this setting. In realistic simulations of LLM alignment using digital twins, the sign estimator substantially reduces preference distortion over a panel of simulated personas, cutting (angular) estimation error by nearly 35% and decreasing disagreement with true population preferences from 12% to 8% compared to standard RLHF. Our method also compares favorably to panel data heuristics that explicitly model user heterogeneity and require tracking individual-level preference data-all while maintaining the implementation simplicity of existing LLM alignment pipelines.",

Using sufficient dimension reduction, we decompose the feature space into target-relevant, sensitive, and shared components, and control the fairness-utility trade-off by selectively removing sensitive information. We provide a theoretical analysis of how prediction error and fairness gaps evolve as shared subspaces are added, and employ influence functions to quantify their effects on the asymptotic behavior of parameter estimates.

        "summary": "Scene-level captioning in instructional videos can enhance learning by requiring an understanding of both visual cues and temporal structure. By aligning visual cues with textual guidance, this understanding supports procedural learning and multimodal reasoning, providing a richer context for skill acquisition. However, captions that fail to capture this structure may lack coherence and quality, which can create confusion and undermine the video's educational intent. To address this gap, we introduce DynaStride, a pipeline to generate coherent, scene-level captions without requiring manual scene segmentation. Using the YouCookII dataset's scene annotations, DynaStride performs adaptive frame sampling and multimodal windowing to capture key transitions within each scene. It then employs a multimodal chain-of-thought process to produce multiple action-object pairs, which are refined and fused using a dynamic stride window selection algorithm that adaptively balances temporal context and redundancy. The final scene-level caption integrates visual semantics and temporal reasoning in a single instructional caption. Empirical evaluations against strong baselines, including VLLaMA3 and GPT-4o, demonstrate consistent gains on both N-gram-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR) and semantic similarity measures (BERTScore, CLIPScore). Qualitative analyses further show that DynaStride produces captions that are more temporally coherent and informative, suggesting a promising direction for improving AI-powered instructional content generation.",

        "summary": "This paper studies group target trajectory intent as the outcome of a cooperative game where the complex-spatio trajectories are modeled using an NLP-based generative model. In our framework, the group intent is specified by the characteristic function of a cooperative game, and allocations for players in the cooperative game are specified by either the core, the Shapley value, or the nucleolus. The resulting allocations induce probability distributions that govern the coordinated spatio-temporal trajectories of the targets that reflect the group's underlying intent. We address two key questions: (1) How can the intent of a group trajectory be optimally formalized as the characteristic function of a cooperative game? (2) How can such intent be inferred from noisy observations of the targets? To answer the first question, we introduce a Fisher-information-based characteristic function of the cooperative game, which yields probability distributions that generate coordinated spatio-temporal patterns. As a generative model for these patterns, we develop an NLP-based generative model built on formal grammar, enabling the creation of realistic multi-target trajectory data. To answer the second question, we train a Graph Transformer Neural Network (GTNN) to infer group trajectory intent-expressed as the characteristic function of the cooperative game-from observational data with high accuracy. The self-attention function of the GTNN depends on the track estimates. Thus, the formulation and algorithms provide a multi-layer approach that spans target tracking (Bayesian signal processing) and the GTNN (for group intent inference).",

        "summary": "Text watermarking for large language models (LLMs) enables model owners to verify text origin and protect intellectual property. While watermarking methods for closed-source LLMs are relatively mature, extending them to open-source models remains challenging, as developers cannot control the decoding process. Consequently, owners of open-source LLMs lack practical means to verify whether text was generated by their models. A core difficulty lies in embedding watermarks directly into model weights without hurting detectability. A promising idea is to distill watermarks from a closed-source model into an open one, but this suffers from (i) poor detectability due to mismatch between learned and predefined patterns, and (ii) fragility to downstream modifications such as fine-tuning or model merging. To overcome these limitations, we propose PRO, a Precise and Robust text watermarking method for open-source LLMs. PRO jointly trains a watermark policy model with the LLM, producing patterns that are easier for the model to learn and more consistent with detection criteria. A regularization term further simulates downstream perturbations and penalizes degradation in watermark detectability, ensuring robustness under model edits. Experiments on open-source LLMs (e.g., LLaMA-3.2, LLaMA-3, Phi-2) show that PRO substantially improves both watermark detectability and resilience to model modifications.",

We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning, enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap, enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively. Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym.

        "summary": "Quantifying the uncertainty in the output of a neural network is essential for deployment in scientific or engineering applications where decisions must be made under limited or noisy data. Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) provide a framework for this purpose by constructing a Bayesian posterior distribution over the network parameters. However, the prior, which is of key importance in any Bayesian setting, is rarely meaningful for BNNs. This is because the complexity of the input-to-output map of a BNN makes it difficult to understand how certain distributions enforce any interpretable constraint on the output space. Gaussian processes (GPs), on the other hand, are often preferred in uncertainty quantification tasks due to their interpretability. The drawback is that GPs are limited to small datasets without advanced techniques, which often rely on the covariance kernel having a specific structure. To address these challenges, we introduce a new class of priors for BNNs, called Mercer priors, such that the resulting BNN has samples which approximate that of a specified GP. The method works by defining a prior directly over the network parameters from the Mercer representation of the covariance kernel, and does not rely on the network having a specific structure. In doing so, we can exploit the scalability of BNNs in a meaningful Bayesian way.",

        "summary": "Distance-based methods involve the computation of distance values between features and are a well-established paradigm in machine learning. In anomaly detection, anomalies are identified by their large distance from normal data points. However, the performance of these methods often hinges on a single, user-selected distance metric (e.g., Euclidean), which may not be optimal for the complex, high-dimensional feature spaces common in astronomy. Here, we introduce a novel anomaly detection method, Distance Multi-Metric Anomaly Detection (DiMMAD), which uses an ensemble of distance metrics to find novelties. Using multiple distance metrics is effectively equivalent to using different geometries in the feature space. By using a robust ensemble of diverse distance metrics, we overcome the metric-selection problem, creating an anomaly score that is not reliant on any single definition of distance. We demonstrate this multi-metric approach as a tool for simple, interpretable scientific discovery on astronomical time series -- (1) with simulated data for the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time, and (2) real data from the Zwicky Transient Facility. We find that DiMMAD excels at out-of-distribution anomaly detection -- anomalies in the data that might be new classes -- and beats other state-of-the-art methods in the goal of maximizing the diversity of new classes discovered. For rare in-distribution anomaly detection, DiMMAD performs similarly to other methods, but may allow for improved interpretability. All our code is open source: DiMMAD is implemented within DistClassiPy: https://github.com/sidchaini/distclassipy/, while all code to reproduce the results of this paper is available here: https://github.com/sidchaini/dimmad/.",

Where a Bayesian treatment is usually associated with high-quality predictions and uncertainties, the practical reality has been the opposite, with unstable training, poor predictive power, and subpar calibration. Building upon recent work on reparametrizations of neural networks, we propose a simple variational family that considers two independent linear subspaces of the parameter space. These represent functional changes inside and outside the support of training data. This allows us to build a fully-correlated approximate posterior reflecting the overparametrization that tunes easy-to-interpret hyperparameters. We develop scalable numerical routines that maximize the associated evidence lower bound (ELBO) and sample from the approximate posterior. Empirically, we observe state-of-the-art performance across tasks, models, and datasets compared to a wide array of baseline methods. Our results show that approximate Bayesian inference applied to deep neural networks is far from a lost cause when constructing inference mechanisms that reflect the geometry of reparametrizations.",

In practice, we typically employ the pairwise $t$-test to compare outcomes between the treatment and control groups, thereby assessing the effectiveness of a given strategy. To be trustworthy, these experiments must keep Type I error (i.e., false positive rate) under control; otherwise, we may launch harmful strategies. However, in real-world applications, we find that A/B testing often fails to deliver reliable results. When the data distribution departs from normality or when the treatment and control groups differ in sample size, the commonly used pairwise $t$-test is no longer trustworthy. In this paper, we quantify how skewed, long tailed data and unequal allocation distort error rates and derive explicit formulas for the minimum sample size required for the $t$-test to remain valid. We find that many online feedback metrics require hundreds of millions samples to ensure reliable A/B testing. Thus we introduce an Edgeworth-based correction that provides more accurate $p$-values when the available sample size is limited. Offline experiments on a leading A/B testing platform corroborate the practical value of our theoretical minimum sample size thresholds and demonstrate that the corrected method substantially improves the reliability of A/B testing in real-world conditions.",

        "summary": "As a window for urban sensing, human mobility contains rich spatiotemporal information that reflects both residents' behavior preferences and the functions of urban areas. The analysis of human mobility has attracted the attention of many researchers. However, existing methods often address specific tasks from a particular perspective, leading to insufficient modeling of human mobility and limited applicability of the learned knowledge in various downstream applications. To address these challenges, this paper proposes to push massive amounts of human mobility data into a spatiotemporal model, discover latent semantics behind mobility behavior and support various urban sensing tasks. Specifically, a large-scale and widely covering human mobility data is collected through the ubiquitous base station system and a framework named General-purpose and Dynamic Human Mobility Embedding (GDHME) for urban sensing is introduced. The framework follows the self-supervised learning idea and contains two major stages. In stage 1, GDHME treats people and regions as nodes within a dynamic graph, unifying human mobility data as people-region-time interactions. An encoder operating in continuous-time dynamically computes evolving node representations, capturing dynamic states for both people and regions. Moreover, an autoregressive self-supervised task is specially designed to guide the learning of the general-purpose node embeddings. In stage 2, these representations are utilized to support various tasks. To evaluate the effectiveness of our GDHME framework, we further construct a multi-task urban sensing benchmark. Offline experiments demonstrate GDHME's ability to automatically learn valuable node features from vast amounts of data. Furthermore, our framework is used to deploy the JiuTian ChuanLiu Big Model, a system that has been presented at the 2023 China Mobile Worldwide Partner Conference.",

We extract I-V data from fabricated armchair and zigzag devices, fit high-order polynomials to emulate diode behavior in software, and train KANs on vision benchmarks using these learned basis functions.

Existing data synthesis methods, such as random environment sampling or multi-agent role-playing, are not powerful enough to generate high-quality data in real-world environments. Practical challenges come in three folds: targeted model training, isolation of tool architecture, and multi-turn logical dependency. To address these structural deficiencies, we present FunReason-MT, a novel data synthesis framework for real-world multi-turn tool use.

        "summary": "Neuromorphic computing systems are set to revolutionize energy-constrained robotics by achieving orders-of-magnitude efficiency gains, while enabling native temporal processing. Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) represent a promising algorithmic approach for these systems, yet their application to complex control tasks faces two critical challenges: (1) the non-differentiable nature of spiking neurons necessitates surrogate gradients with unclear optimization properties, and (2) the stateful dynamics of SNNs require training on sequences, which in reinforcement learning (RL) is hindered by limited sequence lengths during early training, preventing the network from bridging its warm-up period. We address these challenges by systematically analyzing surrogate gradient slope settings, showing that shallower slopes increase gradient magnitude in deeper layers but reduce alignment with true gradients. In supervised learning, we find no clear preference for fixed or scheduled slopes. The effect is much more pronounced in RL settings, where shallower slopes or scheduled slopes lead to a 2.1x improvement in both training and final deployed performance. Next, we propose a novel training approach that leverages a privileged guiding policy to bootstrap the learning process, while still exploiting online environment interactions with the spiking policy. Combining our method with an adaptive slope schedule for a real-world drone position control task, we achieve an average return of 400 points, substantially outperforming prior techniques, including Behavioral Cloning and TD3BC, which achieve at most --200 points under the same conditions.

        "summary": "With the rapid development of LLM-based agents, there is a growing trend to incorporate agent-specific data into the pre-training stage of LLMs, aiming to better align LLMs with real-world autonomous task execution. However, current pre-training benchmarks primarily focus on isolated and static skills, e.g., common knowledge or mathematical/code reasoning, and fail to reflect model's agentic capabilities. On the other hand, agent benchmarks are typically designed for post-trained models, requiring multi-turn task execution abilities that base models struggle to support. Thus, there is a compelling need for a benchmark that can evaluate agentic potentials during pre-training and guide the model training more effectively. To address this gap, we propose APTBench, a framework that converts real-world agent tasks and successful trajectories into multiple-choice or text completion questions tailored for base models. It focuses on core agentic abilities, e.g., planning and action, and covers key agent scenarios, software engineering and deep research. Compared to existing general-purpose benchmarks, APTBench offers a more predictive signal of a model's downstream performance as an agent, while remaining significantly more lightweight and cost-effective than full-scale, end-to-end agent evaluations after post-training.",

Current LLM reasoning, hindered by computationally inefficient sequential generation and rigid reasoning strategies, creates a critical bottleneck for the Web services. Existing approaches typically optimize the LLM reasoning for either efficiency or quality but struggle to achieve both, and thus fail to meet the dual requirements of modern Web platforms. To overcome these limitations, we propose Orion, a novel and efficient reasoning framework that enables dependency-aware query decomposition and logic-parallel content expansion. Concretely, Orion decomposes a single query reasoning process into two synergistic phases: (1) \\textit{key point generation}, which distills logically structured key points through retrieval-augmented few-shot prompting, and (2) \\textit{content parallel expansion}, which concurrently elaborates on these points based on a dependency graph to ensure logical consistency. Furthermore, Orion introduces a pipeline scheduling mechanism that exploits the complementary computational characteristics of the two phases (generation imposes pressure on GPU computing and expansion stresses on GPU memory) across multiple queries, enabling cross-query parallelism and dramatically improving reasoning performance (\\ie, efficiency and quality). Experiments on diverse benchmarks show that Orion not only delivers up to 4.33x higher token generation speed and 3.42x lower answer latency over the baselines but also improves reasoning quality by up to 18.75% through explicitly modeling inter-point dependencies.",

By minimizing error across large datasets, most systems deliver strong aggregate accuracy yet falter at the margins: patients with rare variants, multimorbidity, or underrepresented demographics. This average patient fallacy erodes both equity and trust. We propose a different design: a multi-agent ecosystem for N-of-1 decision support. In this environment, agents clustered by organ systems, patient populations, and analytic modalities draw on a shared library of models and evidence synthesis tools. Their results converge in a coordination layer that weighs reliability, uncertainty, and data density before presenting the clinician with a decision-support packet: risk estimates bounded by confidence ranges, outlier flags, and linked evidence. Validation shifts from population averages to individual reliability, measured by error in low-density regions, calibration in the small, and risk--coverage trade-offs. Anticipated challenges include computational demands, automation bias, and regulatory fit, addressed through caching strategies, consensus checks, and adaptive trial frameworks. By moving from monolithic models to orchestrated intelligence, this approach seeks to align medical AI with the first principle of medicine: care that is transparent, equitable, and centered on the individual.",

Modern artificial neural networks now rival humans in language, perception, and reasoning, yet it is still largely unknown whether these artificial systems organize information as the brain does. Existing brain-AI alignment studies have shown the striking correspondence between the two systems, but such comparisons remain bound to specific inputs and tasks, offering no common ground for comparing how AI models with different kinds of modalities-vision, language, or multimodal-are intrinsically organized. Here we introduce a groundbreaking concept of Brain-like Space: a unified geometric space in which every AI model can be precisely situated and compared by mapping its intrinsic spatial attention topological organization onto canonical human functional brain networks, regardless of input modality, task, or sensory domain. Our extensive analysis of 151 Transformer-based models spanning state-of-the-art large vision models, large language models, and large multimodal models uncovers a continuous arc-shaped geometry within this space, reflecting a gradual increase of brain-likeness; different models exhibit distinct distribution patterns within this geometry associated with different degrees of brain-likeness, shaped not merely by their modality but by whether the pretraining paradigm emphasizes global semantic abstraction and whether the positional encoding scheme facilitates deep fusion across different modalities. Moreover, the degree of brain-likeness for a model and its downstream task performance are not \"identical twins\". The Brain-like Space provides the first unified framework for situating, quantifying, and comparing intelligence across domains, revealing the deep organizational principles that bridge machines and the brain.",

This paper provides VDSAgents, a multi-agent system grounded in the Predictability-Computability-Stability (PCS) principles proposed in the Veridical Data Science (VDS) framework. Guided by PCS principles, the system implements a modular workflow for data cleaning, feature engineering, modeling, and evaluation.

We evaluate VDSAgents on nine datasets with diverse characteristics, comparing it with state-of-the-art end-to-end data science systems, such as AutoKaggle and DataInterpreter, using DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4o as backends.

Studies show that gLLMs can outperform both crowd workers and trained coders, such as research assistants, on various coding tasks relevant to communication science, often at a fraction of the time and cost. Additionally, gLLMs can decode implicit meanings and contextual information, be instructed using natural language, deployed with only basic programming skills, and require little to no annotated data beyond a validation dataset - constituting a paradigm shift in automated content analysis. Despite their potential, the integration of gLLMs into the methodological toolkit of communication research remains underdeveloped.

This paper synthesizes emerging research on gLLM-assisted quantitative content analysis and proposes a comprehensive best-practice guide to navigate these challenges.

This task can be seen as a form of claim verification, where the claim corresponds to a future event and the task is to assess the plausibility of that event. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent framework for claim verification, whereby different agents may disagree on claim veracity and bring specific evidence for and against the claims, represented as quantitative bipolar argumentation frameworks (QBAFs). We then instantiate the framework for supporting claim verification, with a variety of agents realised with Large Language Models (LLMs): (1) ArgLLM agents, an existing approach for claim verification that generates and evaluates QBAFs; (2) RbAM agents, whereby LLM-empowered Relation-based Argument Mining (RbAM) from external sources is used to generate QBAFs; (3) RAG-ArgLLM agents, extending ArgLLM agents with a form of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) of arguments from external sources. Finally, we conduct experiments with two standard judgmental forecasting datasets, with instances of our framework with two or three agents, empowered by six different base LLMs. We observe that combining evidence from agents can improve forecasting accuracy, especially in the case of three agents, while providing an explainable combination of evidence for claim verification.",

        "summary": "Despite the strong reasoning ability of large language models~(LLMs), they are prone to errors and hallucinations. As a result, how to check their outputs effectively and efficiently has become a critical problem in their applications. Existing checking methods heavily rely on external resources, such as trained verifiers (e.g., process/outcome reward models) or elaborate prompts, which lead to high computational overhead and are only applicable to specific domains. In this paper, we investigate whether the internal behaviors of LLMs have already implied the credibility of their reasoning paths. Specifically, we find that the rank of the correlation matrix between the input problem and the output reasoning path is a robust indicator of reasoning correctness. Different from other correctness indicators for LLMs, the calculation of the correlation matrix only relies on the LLM itself, which avoids the hassle of training a separate model or designing complicated prompts. Based on it, we design a simple, plug-and-play Self-Indicator method to reweight candidate reasoning paths, which achieves significant performance improvements than other voting and verification methods with very few computational overhead. Our experiments across multiple LLMs of varying scales and model families have further shown the effectiveness of Self-Indicator. It achieves over 75% accuracy in distinguishing correct reasoning paths from incorrect ones, and, in turn, improves the accuracies on three reasoning benchmarks by more than 8%.",

The primary usage of abstractions for MCTS is to enhance the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) value during the tree policy by aggregating visits and returns of an abstract node. However, this direct usage of abstractions does not take the case into account where multiple actions with the same parent might be in the same abstract node, as these would then all have the same UCB value, thus requiring a tiebreak rule. In state-of-the-art abstraction algorithms such as pruned On the Go Abstractions (pruned OGA), this case has not been noticed, and a random tiebreak rule was implicitly chosen.

Based on these findings, we propose UniPlanner, the first planning framework designed for multi-dataset integration in autonomous vehicle decision-making.

Second, the Gradient-Free Trajectory Mapper (GFTM) learns robust history-future correlations from multiple datasets, transforming historical trajectories into universal planning priors. Its gradient-free design ensures the introduction of valuable priors while preventing shortcut learning, making the planning knowledge safely transferable.

However, significant limitations remain: MLLMs generalize poorly across digital-physical spaces and embodiments; vision-language-action models (VLAs) produce low-level actions yet lack robust high-level embodied reasoning; and most embodied large language models (ELLMs) are constrained to digital-space with poor generalization to the physical world. Thus, unified models that operate seamlessly across digital and physical spaces while generalizing across embodiments and tasks remain absent. We introduce the \\textbf{Boundless Large Model (BLM$_1$)}, a multimodal spatial foundation model that preserves instruction following and reasoning, incorporates embodied knowledge, and supports robust cross-embodiment control. BLM$_1$ integrates three key capabilities -- \\textit{cross-space transfer, cross-task learning, and cross-embodiment generalization} -- via a two-stage training paradigm. Stage I injects embodied knowledge into the MLLM through curated digital corpora while maintaining language competence. Stage II trains a policy module through an intent-bridging interface that extracts high-level semantics from the MLLM to guide control, without fine-tuning the MLLM backbone. This process is supported by a self-collected cross-embodiment demonstration suite spanning four robot embodiments and six progressively challenging tasks. Evaluations across digital and physical benchmarks show that a single BLM$_1$ instance outperforms four model families -- MLLMs, ELLMs, VLAs, and GMLMs -- achieving $\\sim\\!\\textbf{6%}$ gains in digital tasks and $\\sim\\!\\textbf{3%}$ in physical tasks.",

While there have been a few recent evaluation datasets that capture the characteristics of hard-to-search but easy-to-verify problems -- requiring the integration of ambiguous, indirect, and cross-domain cues -- these data resources remain scarce and are mostly designed for evaluation, making them unsuitable for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL). Meanwhile, manually curating non-trivially retrievable questions -- where answers cannot be found through a single direct query but instead require multi-hop reasoning over oblique and loosely connected evidence -- incurs prohibitive human costs and fails to scale, creating a critical data bottleneck for training high-capability retrieval-and-reasoning agents. To address this, we present an automated framework for generating high-difficulty, training-ready multi-hop questions from semi-structured knowledge sources. The system (i) grows diverse, logically labeled evidence clusters through Natural Language Inference (NLI)-based relation typing and diversity-aware expansion; (ii) applies reverse question construction to compose oblique cues so that isolated signals are underinformative but their combination uniquely identifies the target entity; and (iii) enforces quality with a two-step evaluation pipeline that combines multi-model consensus filtering with structured constraint decomposition and evidence-based matching. The result is a scalable process that yields complex, retrieval-resistant yet verifiable questions suitable for SFT/RL training as well as challenging evaluation, substantially reducing human curation effort while preserving the difficulty profile of strong evaluation benchmarks.",

        "summary": "Incident management (IM) is central to the reliability of large-scale cloud systems. Yet manual IM, where on-call engineers examine metrics, logs, and traces is labor-intensive and error-prone in the face of massive and heterogeneous observability data. Existing automated IM approaches often struggle to generalize across systems, provide limited interpretability, and incur high deployment costs, which hinders adoption in practice. In this paper, we present OpsAgent, a lightweight, self-evolving multi-agent system for IM that employs a training-free data processor to convert heterogeneous observability data into structured textual descriptions, along with a multi-agent collaboration framework that makes diagnostic inference transparent and auditable. To support continual capability growth, OpsAgent also introduces a dual self-evolution mechanism that integrates internal model updates with external experience accumulation, thereby closing the deployment loop. Comprehensive experiments on the OPENRCA benchmark demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and show that OpsAgent is generalizable, interpretable, cost-efficient, and self-evolving, making it a practically deployable and sustainable solution for long-term operation in real-world cloud systems.",

However, analyzing vast amounts of diverse log data remains significantly challenging, as high costs, lack of in-house expertise, and time constraints make even basic analysis difficult for many organizations. This study introduces LLMLogAnalyzer, a clustering-based log analysis chatbot that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) and Machine Learning (ML) algorithms to simplify and streamline log analysis processes. This innovative approach addresses key LLM limitations, including context window constraints and poor structured text handling capabilities, enabling more effective summarization, pattern extraction, and anomaly detection tasks. LLMLogAnalyzer is evaluated across four distinct domain logs and various tasks. Results demonstrate significant performance improvements over state-of-the-art LLM-based chatbots, including ChatGPT, ChatPDF, and NotebookLM, with consistent gains ranging from 39% to 68% across different tasks. The system also exhibits strong robustness, achieving a 93% reduction in interquartile range (IQR) when using ROUGE-1 scores, indicating significantly lower result variability. The framework's effectiveness stems from its modular architecture comprising a router, log recognizer, log parser, and search tools. This design enhances LLM capabilities for structured text analysis while improving accuracy and robustness, making it a valuable resource for both cybersecurity experts and non-technical users.",

Despite its rapid advancement, achieving effective generalization across heterogeneous time series data remains a significant challenge. Existing methods have made progress by extending single-domain models, yet often fall short when facing domain-specific trend shifts and inconsistent periodic patterns. We argue that a key limitation lies in treating temporal series as undifferentiated sequence, without explicitly decoupling their inherent structural components. To address this, we propose OneCast, a structured and modular forecasting framework that decomposes time series into seasonal and trend components, each modeled through tailored generative pathways. Specifically, the seasonal component is captured by a lightweight projection module that reconstructs periodic patterns via interpretable basis functions. In parallel, the trend component is encoded into discrete tokens at segment level via a semantic-aware tokenizer, and subsequently inferred through a masked discrete diffusion mechanism. The outputs from both branches are combined to produce a final forecast that captures seasonal patterns while tracking domain-specific trends. Extensive experiments across eight domains demonstrate that OneCast mostly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "summary": "Shifts in individual movement patterns following disruptive events can reveal changing demands for community resources. However, predicting such shifts before disruptive events remains challenging for several reasons. First, measures are lacking for individuals' heterogeneous social infrastructure resilience (SIR), which directly influences their movement patterns, and commonly used features are often limited or unavailable at scale, e.g., sociodemographic characteristics. Second, the complex interactions between individual movement patterns and spatial contexts have not been sufficiently captured. Third, individual-level movement may be spatially sparse and not well-suited to traditional decision-making methods for movement predictions. This study incorporates individuals' SIR into a conditioned deep learning model to capture the complex relationships between individual movement patterns and local spatial context using large-scale, sparse individual-level data. Our experiments demonstrate that incorporating individuals' SIR and spatial context can enhance the model's ability to predict post-event individual movement patterns. The conditioned model can capture the divergent shifts in movement patterns among individuals who exhibit similar pre-event patterns but differ in SIR.",

In real-world applications -- from biology to medicine and social science -- causal effects depend on regime (age, country, dose, genotype, or lab protocol). Our proposed judo calculus formalizes this context dependence formally as local truth: a causal claim is proven true on a cover of regimes, not everywhere at once. The Lawvere-Tierney modal operator j chooses which regimes are relevant; j-stability means the claim holds constructively and consistently across that family. We describe an algorithmic and implementation framework for judo calculus, combining it with standard score-based, constraint-based, and gradient-based causal discovery methods. We describe experimental results on a range of domains, from synthetic to real-world datasets from biology and economics. Our experimental results show the computational efficiency gained by the decentralized nature of sheaf-theoretic causal discovery, as well as improved performance over classical causal discovery methods.",

        "summary": "Agents are rapidly advancing in automating digital work, but enterprises face a harder challenge: moving beyond prototypes to deployed systems that deliver measurable business value. This path is complicated by fragmented frameworks, slow development, and the absence of standardized evaluation practices. Generalist agents have emerged as a promising direction, excelling on academic benchmarks and offering flexibility across task types, applications, and modalities. Yet, evidence of their use in production enterprise settings remains limited. This paper reports IBM's experience developing and piloting the Computer Using Generalist Agent (CUGA), which has been open-sourced for the community (https://github.com/cuga-project/cuga-agent). CUGA adopts a hierarchical planner--executor architecture with strong analytical foundations, achieving state-of-the-art performance on AppWorld and WebArena. Beyond benchmarks, it was evaluated in a pilot within the Business-Process-Outsourcing talent acquisition domain, addressing enterprise requirements for scalability, auditability, safety, and governance. To support assessment, we introduce BPO-TA, a 26-task benchmark spanning 13 analytics endpoints. In preliminary evaluations, CUGA approached the accuracy of specialized agents while indicating potential for reducing development time and cost. Our contribution is twofold: presenting early evidence of generalist agents operating at enterprise scale, and distilling technical and organizational lessons from this initial pilot. We outline requirements and next steps for advancing research-grade architectures like CUGA into robust, enterprise-ready systems.",

This work addresses the problem of decentralized goal assignment for multi-agent path planning, where agents independently generate ranked preferences over goals based on structured representations of the environment, including grid visualizations and scenario data. After this reasoning phase, agents exchange their goal rankings, and assignments are determined by a fixed, deterministic conflict-resolution rule (e.g., agent index ordering), without negotiation or iterative coordination. We systematically compare greedy heuristics, optimal assignment, and large language model (LLM)-based agents in fully observable grid-world settings. Our results show that LLM-based agents, when provided with well-designed prompts and relevant quantitative information, can achieve near-optimal makespans and consistently outperform traditional heuristics. These findings underscore the potential of language models for decentralized goal assignment in multi-agent path planning and highlight the importance of information structure in such systems.",

Sequential prompting methods are prone to context drift, loss of goal information, and recurrent failure cycles, while hierarchical prompting methods often weaken cross-level continuity or incur substantial runtime overhead. We introduce ReCAP (Recursive Context-Aware Reasoning and Planning), a hierarchical framework with shared context for reasoning and planning in LLMs. ReCAP combines three key mechanisms: (i) plan-ahead decomposition, in which the model generates a full subtask list, executes the first item, and refines the remainder; (ii) structured re-injection of parent plans, maintaining consistent multi-level context during recursive return; and (iii) memory-efficient execution, bounding the active prompt so costs scale linearly with task depth. Together these mechanisms align high-level goals with low-level actions, reduce redundant prompting, and preserve coherent context updates across recursion. Experiments demonstrate that ReCAP substantially improves subgoal alignment and success rates on various long-horizon reasoning benchmarks, achieving a 32% gain on synchronous Robotouille and a 29% improvement on asynchronous Robotouille under the strict pass@1 protocol.",

Consequently, their rapid adoption in computational pathology was expected to deliver comparable breakthroughs in cancer diagnosis, prognostication, and multimodal retrieval. However, recent systematic evaluations reveal fundamental weaknesses: low diagnostic accuracy, poor robustness, geometric instability, heavy computational demands, and concerning safety vulnerabilities. This short paper examines these shortcomings and argues that they stem from deeper conceptual mismatches between the assumptions underlying generic foundation modeling in mainstream AI and the intrinsic complexity of human tissue. Seven interrelated causes are identified: biological complexity, ineffective self-supervision, overgeneralization, excessive architectural complexity, lack of domain-specific innovation, insufficient data, and a fundamental design flaw related to tissue patch size. These findings suggest that current pathology foundation models remain conceptually misaligned with the nature of tissue morphology and call for a fundamental rethinking of the paradigm itself.",

ME-POMDPs represent a finite set of POMDPs that share the same state, action, and observation spaces, but may arbitrarily vary in their transition, observation, and reward models. Such models arise, for instance, when multiple domain experts disagree on how to model a problem. The goal is to find a single policy that is robust against any choice of POMDP within the set, i.e., a policy that maximizes the worst-case reward across all POMDPs. We generalize and expand on existing work in the following way. First, we show that ME-POMDPs can be generalized to POMDPs with sets of initial beliefs, which we call adversarial-belief POMDPs (AB-POMDPs). Second, we show that any arbitrary ME-POMDP can be reduced to a ME-POMDP that only varies in its transition and reward functions or only in its observation and reward functions, while preserving (optimal) policies. We then devise exact and approximate (point-based) algorithms to compute robust policies for AB-POMDPs, and thus ME-POMDPs.

        "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are one of the most promising bio-inspired neural networks models and have drawn increasing attention in recent years. The event-driven communication mechanism of SNNs allows for sparse and theoretically low-power operations on dedicated neuromorphic hardware. However, the binary nature of instantaneous spikes also leads to considerable information loss in SNNs, resulting in accuracy degradation. To address this issue, we propose a multi-level spiking neuron model able to provide both low-quantization error and minimal inference latency while approaching the performance of full precision Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Experimental results with popular network architectures and datasets, show that multi-level spiking neurons provide better information compression, allowing therefore a reduction in latency without performance loss. When compared to binary SNNs on image classification scenarios, multi-level SNNs indeed allow reducing by 2 to 3 times the energy consumption depending on the number of quantization intervals. On neuromorphic data, our approach allows us to drastically reduce the inference latency to 1 timestep, which corresponds to a compression factor of 10 compared to previously published results. At the architectural level, we propose a new residual architecture that we call Sparse-ResNet. Through a careful analysis of the spikes propagation in residual connections we highlight a spike avalanche effect, that affects most spiking residual architectures. Using our Sparse-ResNet architecture, we can provide state-of-the-art accuracy results in image classification while reducing by more than 20% the network activity compared to the previous spiking ResNets.",

        "summary": "Quantum networks rely on both quantum and classical channels for coordinated operation. Current architectures employ entanglement distribution and key exchange over quantum channels but often assume that classical communication is sufficiently secure. In practice, classical channels protected by traditional cryptography remain vulnerable to quantum adversaries, since large-scale quantum computers could break widely used public-key schemes and reduce the effective security of symmetric cryptography. This perspective presents a quantum-resistant network architecture that secures classical communication with post-quantum cryptographic techniques while supporting entanglement-based communication over quantum channels. Beyond cryptographic protection, the framework incorporates continuous monitoring of both quantum and classical layers, together with orchestration across heterogeneous infrastructures, to ensure end-to-end security. Collectively, these mechanisms provide a pathway toward scalable, robust, and secure quantum networks that remain dependable against both classical and quantum-era threats.",

        "summary": "Extracting features from the speech is the most critical process in speech signal processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC) are the most widely used features in the majority of the speaker and speech recognition applications, as the filtering in this feature is similar to the filtering taking place in the human ear. But the main drawback of this feature is that it provides only the frequency information of the signal but does not provide the information about at what time which frequency is present. The wavelet transform, with its flexible time-frequency window, provides time and frequency information of the signal and is an appropriate tool for the analysis of non-stationary signals like speech. On the other hand, because of its uniform frequency scaling, a typical wavelet transform may be less effective in analysing speech signals, have poorer frequency resolution in low frequencies, and be less in line with human auditory perception. Hence, it is necessary to develop a feature that incorporates the merits of both MFCC and wavelet transform. A great deal of studies are trying to combine both these features. The present Wavelet Transform based Mel-scaled feature extraction methods require more computation when a wavelet transform is applied on top of Mel-scale filtering, since it adds extra processing steps. Here we are proposing a method to extract Mel scale features in time domain combining the concept of wavelet transform, thus reducing the computational burden of time-frequency conversion and the complexity of wavelet extraction. Combining our proposed Time domain Mel frequency Wavelet Coefficient(TMFWC) technique with the reservoir computing methodology has significantly improved the efficiency of audio signal processing.",

        "summary": "As machine learning (ML) models become increasingly deployed through cloud infrastructures, the confidentiality of user data during inference poses a significant security challenge. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) has emerged as a compelling cryptographic technique that enables computation on encrypted data, allowing predictions to be generated without decrypting sensitive inputs. However, the integration of HE within large scale cloud native pipelines remains constrained by high computational overhead, orchestration complexity, and model compatibility issues. This paper presents a systematic framework for the design and optimization of cloud native homomorphic encryption workflows that support privacy-preserving ML inference. The proposed architecture integrates containerized HE modules with Kubernetes-based orchestration, enabling elastic scaling and parallel encrypted computation across distributed environments. Furthermore, optimization strategies including ciphertext packing, polynomial modulus adjustment, and operator fusion are employed to minimize latency and resource consumption while preserving cryptographic integrity. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed system achieves up to 3.2times inference acceleration and 40% reduction in memory utilization compared to conventional HE pipelines. These findings illustrate a practical pathway for deploying secure ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) systems that guarantee data confidentiality under zero-trust cloud conditions.",

        "summary": "Fixed beamforming is widely used in practice since it does not depend on the estimation of noise statistics and provides relatively stable performance. However, a single beamformer cannot adapt to varying acoustic conditions, which limits its interference suppression capability. To address this, adaptive convex combination (ACC) algorithms have been introduced, where the outputs of multiple fixed beamformers are linearly combined to improve robustness. Nevertheless, ACC often fails in highly non-stationary scenarios, such as rapidly moving interference, since its adaptive updates cannot reliably track rapid changes. To overcome this limitation, we propose a frame-online neural fusion framework for multiple distortionless differential beamformers, which estimates the combination weights through a neural network. Compared with conventional ACC, the proposed method adapts more effectively to dynamic acoustic environments, achieving stronger interference suppression while maintaining the distortionless constraint.",

This success, however, has not translated as effectively to the visual domain, where models, including LLMs, continue to struggle with compositional understanding, sample efficiency, and general-purpose problem-solving. We investigate Video Diffusion Models (VDMs) as a promising direction for bridging this gap. Pretraining on spatiotemporal data endows these models with strong inductive biases for structure and dynamics, which we hypothesize can support broad task adaptability. To test this, we design a controlled evaluation in which both a pretrained LLM and a pretrained VDM are equipped with lightweight adapters and presented with tasks in their natural modalities. Across benchmarks including ARC-AGI, ConceptARC, visual games, route planning, and cellular automata, VDMs demonstrate higher data efficiency than their language counterparts.

Conventional recommenders, dominated by massive embedding tables, tend to plateau as embedding dimensions grow.

Yet most industrial deployments remain proprietary, leaving two fundamental questions open: (1) Do the expected scaling laws hold on public benchmarks? (2) What is the minimal post-training recipe that enables competitive performance? We present MiniOneRec, to the best of our knowledge, the first fully open-source generative recommendation framework, which provides an end-to-end workflow spanning SID construction, supervised fine-tuning, and recommendation-oriented reinforcement learning. We generate SIDs via a Residual Quantized VAE and post-train Qwen backbones ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters on the Amazon Review dataset. Our experiments reveal a consistent downward trend in both training and evaluation losses with increasing model size, validating the parameter efficiency of the generative approach. To further enhance performance, we propose a lightweight yet effective post-training pipeline that (1) enforces full-process SID alignment and (2) applies reinforcement learning with constrained decoding and hybrid rewards. Together, these techniques yield significant improvements in both ranking accuracy and candidate diversity.",

        "summary": "Remote sensing applications increasingly rely on deep learning for scene classification. However, their performance is often constrained by the scarcity of labeled data and the high cost of annotation across diverse geographic and sensor domains. While recent vision-language models like CLIP have shown promise by learning transferable representations at scale by aligning visual and textual modalities, their direct application to remote sensing remains suboptimal due to significant domain gaps and the need for task-specific semantic adaptation. To address this critical challenge, we systematically explore prompt learning as a lightweight and efficient adaptation strategy for few-shot remote sensing image scene classification. We evaluate several representative methods, including Context Optimization, Conditional Context Optimization, Multi-modal Prompt Learning, and Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints. These approaches reflect complementary design philosophies: from static context optimization to conditional prompts for enhanced generalization, multi-modal prompts for joint vision-language adaptation, and semantically regularized prompts for stable learning without forgetting. We benchmark these prompt-learning methods against two standard baselines: zero-shot CLIP with hand-crafted prompts and a linear probe trained on frozen CLIP features. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark remote sensing datasets, including cross-dataset generalization tests, we demonstrate that prompt learning consistently outperforms both baselines in few-shot scenarios. Notably, Prompting with Self-Regulating Constraints achieves the most robust cross-domain performance. Our findings underscore prompt learning as a scalable and efficient solution for bridging the domain gap in satellite and aerial imagery, providing a strong foundation for future research in this field.",

In this framework, the UAV transmits integrated sensing and communication signals to provide communication services to ground users, while simultaneously collecting echoes that are uploaded to the DT server to progressively construct virtual environments (VEs). These VEs accelerate model training and are continuously updated with real-time UAV sensing data during deployment, supporting decision-making and enhancing flight safety. Based on this framework, we further develop a trajectory design scheme that integrates simulated annealing for efficient user scheduling with the twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient algorithm for continuous trajectory design, aiming to minimize mission completion time while ensuring obstacle avoidance. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves faster convergence, higher flight safety, and shorter mission completion time compared with baseline methods, providing a robust and efficient solution for LAWN deployment in unknown environments.",

To address this challenge, we present a training-free framework that combines an object-centric approach with self-refinement to improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to synthesize explicit layouts from input prompts, and we inject these layouts into the image generation process, where a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned outcome iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding with self-refine-based inference-time scaling, our framework achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared to recent text-to-image models.

        "summary": "Navigating to a designated goal using visual information is a fundamental capability for intelligent robots. Most classical visual navigation methods are restricted to single-goal, single-modality, and closed set goal settings. To address the practical demands of multi-modal, open-vocabulary goal queries and multi-goal visual navigation, we propose LagMemo, a navigation system that leverages a language 3D Gaussian Splatting memory. During exploration, LagMemo constructs a unified 3D language memory. With incoming task goals, the system queries the memory, predicts candidate goal locations, and integrates a local perception-based verification mechanism to dynamically match and validate goals during navigation. For fair and rigorous evaluation, we curate GOAT-Core, a high-quality core split distilled from GOAT-Bench tailored to multi-modal open-vocabulary multi-goal visual navigation. Experimental results show that LagMemo's memory module enables effective multi-modal open-vocabulary goal localization, and that LagMemo outperforms state-of-the-art methods in multi-goal visual navigation.

Unlike prior approaches that rely on classifier-based or classifier-free guidance, MGAudio enables the generative model to guide itself through a dedicated training objective designed for video-conditioned audio generation. The framework integrates three main components: (1) a scalable flow-based Transformer model, (2) a dual-role alignment mechanism where the audio-visual encoder serves both as a conditioning module and as a feature aligner to improve generation quality, and (3) a model-guided objective that enhances cross-modal coherence and audio realism. MGAudio achieves state-of-the-art performance on VGGSound, reducing FAD to 0.40, substantially surpassing the best classifier-free guidance baselines, and consistently outperforms existing methods across FD, IS, and alignment metrics. It also generalizes well to the challenging UnAV-100 benchmark. These results highlight model-guided dual-role alignment as a powerful and scalable paradigm for conditional video-to-audio generation.

To structure and synthesize findings, we introduce the SCOUR framework, encompassing Surveillance mechanisms, Consent and awareness, Operational data flow, Usage and exploitation, and Regulatory and technical safeguards. Findings reveal that smart devices have been covertly capturing personal data, especially with smart toys and voice-activated smart gadgets built for youth. These issues are worsened by unclear data collection practices and insufficient transparency in smart device applications. Balancing privacy and utility in smart devices is crucial, as youth are becoming more aware of privacy breaches and value their personal data more.

Despite this progress, relying solely on real-world data limits the variety of driving scenarios for training. Synthetic scenario generation has emerged as a promising solution to enrich the diversity of training data; however, its application within E2E AD models remains largely unexplored. This is primarily due to the absence of a designated ego vehicle and the associated sensor inputs, such as camera or LiDAR, typically provided in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, we introduce SynAD, the first framework designed to enhance real-world E2E AD models using synthetic data. Our method designates the agent with the most comprehensive driving information as the ego vehicle in a multi-agent synthetic scenario. We further project path-level scenarios onto maps and employ a newly developed Map-to-BEV Network to derive bird's-eye-view features without relying on sensor inputs. Finally, we devise a training strategy that effectively integrates these map-based synthetic data with real driving data. Experimental results demonstrate that SynAD effectively integrates all components and notably enhances safety performance. By bridging synthetic scenario generation and E2E AD, SynAD paves the way for more comprehensive and robust autonomous driving models.",

We introduce a lifecycle-aware framework that systematically incorporates intermediate artifacts such as requirements analysis, state machine modeling, and pseudocode into both the training and inference stages. This design aligns code generation with standard software development phases and enables more structured reasoning. Experiments show that lifecycle-level fine-tuning improves code correctness by up to 75% over the same model before fine-tuning, with performance gains compounding across intermediate stages. Multi-step inference consistently surpasses single-step generation, demonstrating the effectiveness of intermediate scaffolding. Notably, open-source LLMs, once fine-tuned under our framework, match or slightly outperform models pretrained on code.

Traditional image guardrail models, constrained by predefined categories, often misclassify content due to their pure feature-based learning without semantic reasoning.

To address these limitations, we introduce SafeVision, a novel image guardrail that integrates human-like reasoning to enhance adaptability and transparency. Our approach incorporates an effective data collection and generation framework, a policy-following training pipeline, and a customized loss function. We also propose a diverse QA generation and training strategy to enhance learning effectiveness. SafeVision dynamically aligns with evolving safety policies at inference time, eliminating the need for retraining while ensuring precise risk assessments and explanations. Recognizing the limitations of existing unsafe image benchmarks, which either lack granularity or cover limited risks, we introduce VisionHarm, a high-quality dataset comprising two subsets: VisionHarm Third-party (VisionHarm-T) and VisionHarm Comprehensive(VisionHarm-C), spanning diverse harmful categories. Through extensive experiments, we show that SafeVision achieves state-of-the-art performance on different benchmarks. SafeVision outperforms GPT-4o by 8.6% on VisionHarm-T and by 15.5% on VisionHarm-C, while being over 16x faster.

One of them is precise and iterative object editing. In many of the current methods, trying to edit the generated image (for example, changing the color of a particular object in the scene or changing the background while keeping other elements unchanged) by changing the conditioning signals often leads to unintended global changes in the scene. In this work, we take the first steps to address the above challenges. Taking inspiration from the Universal Scene Descriptor (USD) standard developed in the computer graphics community, we introduce the \"Neural Universal Scene Descriptor\" or Neural USD. In this framework, we represent scenes and objects in a structured, hierarchical manner. This accommodates diverse signals, minimizes model-specific constraints, and enables per-object control over appearance, geometry, and pose. We further apply a fine-tuning approach which ensures that the above control signals are disentangled from one another. We evaluate several design considerations for our framework, demonstrating how Neural USD enables iterative and incremental workflows. More information at: https://escontrela.me/neural_usd .",

By performing cryptographic operations natively on GPUs using dedicated compute units (e.g., Intel Arc's XMX units, NVIDIA's Tensor Cores), our solution eliminates the potential architectural bottlenecks that could plague traditional CPU-based verification systems when dealing with large models. This approach leverages the same GPU-based high-memory bandwidth and parallel processing primitives that power ML workloads ensuring integrity checks keep pace with model execution even for massive models exceeding 100GB. This framework establishes a common integrity verification mechanism that works consistently across different GPU vendors and hardware configurations. By anticipating future capabilities for creating secure channels between trusted execution environments and GPU accelerators, we provide a hardware-agnostic foundation that enterprise teams can deploy regardless of their underlying CPU and GPU infrastructures.",

Emerging data sources, such as NASA's FIRMS satellite imagery and Volunteered Geographic Information, offer potential improvements by enabling dynamic fire spread prediction. This study proposes a Multimodal Fire Spread Prediction Framework (MFiSP) that integrates social media data and remote sensing observations to enhance forecast accuracy. By adapting fuel map manipulation strategies between assimilation cycles, the framework dynamically adjusts fire behavior predictions to align with the observed rate of spread. We evaluate the efficacy of MFiSP using synthetically generated fire event polygons across multiple scenarios, analyzing individual and combined impacts on forecast perimeters.

Besides its technical aspect, interoperability has also an economic side, as development time efforts are required to build the interoperability artifacts. Objectives: With the recent advances in the field of large language models (LLMs), we aim at analyzing the effectiveness of LLM-based strategies to make systems interoperate autonomously, at runtime, without human intervention. Method: We selected 13 open source LLMs and curated four versions of a dataset in the agricultural interoperability use case. We performed three runs of each model with each version of the dataset, using two different strategies. Then we compared the effectiveness of the models and the consistency of their results across multiple runs. Results: qwen2.5-coder:32b was the most effective model using both strategies DIRECT (average pass@1 >= 0.99) and CODEGEN (average pass@1 >= 0.89) in three out of four dataset versions. In the fourth dataset version, which included an unit conversion, all models using the strategy DIRECT failed, whereas using CODEGEN qwen2.5-coder:32b succeeded with an average pass@1 = 0.75. Conclusion: Some LLMs can make systems interoperate autonomously. Further evaluation in different domains is recommended, and further research on reliability strategies should be conducted.",

This model takes advantage of both intrinsic and extrinsic characteristics of the camera. The findings of this study underscore the significance of the dataset constitution protocol, particularly with respect to the integration of negative images and the consideration of temporal leakage.

Existing Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) studies focus mainly on query-specific behaviors, leading to unstable attacks with lower success rates.

This challenge can be overcome by exploiting a common vulnerability: leakage of the agent's internal prompt, which turns the attack into a constrained white-box optimization problem. We present QueryIPI, the first query-agnostic IPI method for coding agents. QueryIPI refines malicious tool descriptions through an iterative, prompt-based process informed by the leaked internal prompt. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI achieves up to 87 percent success, outperforming baselines, and the generated malicious descriptions also transfer to real-world systems, highlighting a practical security risk to modern LLM-based coding agents.",

        "summary": "Security in code generation remains a pivotal challenge when applying large language models (LLMs). This paper introduces RefleXGen, an innovative method that significantly enhances code security by integrating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques with guided self-reflection mechanisms inherent in LLMs. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on fine-tuning LLMs or developing specialized secure code datasets - processes that can be resource-intensive - RefleXGen iteratively optimizes the code generation process through self-assessment and reflection without the need for extensive resources. Within this framework, the model continuously accumulates and refines its knowledge base, thereby progressively improving the security of the generated code. Experimental results demonstrate that RefleXGen substantially enhances code security across multiple models, achieving a 13.6% improvement with GPT-3.5 Turbo, a 6.7% improvement with GPT-4o, a 4.5% improvement with CodeQwen, and a 5.8% improvement with Gemini. Our findings highlight that improving the quality of model self-reflection constitutes an effective and practical strategy for strengthening the security of AI-generated code.",

        "summary": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standardized interface enabling seamless integration between Large Language Models (LLMs) and external data sources and tools. While MCP significantly reduces development complexity and enhances agent capabilities, its openness and extensibility introduce critical security vulnerabilities that threaten system trustworthiness and user data protection. This paper systematically analyzes the security landscape of MCP-based systems, identifying three principal threat categories: (1) agent hijacking attacks stemming from protocol design deficiencies; (2) traditional web vulnerabilities in MCP servers; and (3) supply chain security. To address these challenges, we comprehensively survey existing defense strategies, examining both proactive server-side scanning approaches, ranging from layered detection pipelines and agentic auditing frameworks to zero-trust registry systems, and runtime interaction monitoring solutions that provide continuous oversight and policy enforcement. Our analysis reveals that MCP security fundamentally represents a paradigm shift where the attack surface extends from traditional code execution to semantic interpretation of natural language metadata, necessitating novel defense mechanisms tailored to this unique threat model.",

Predicting how AI will reshape work requires understanding not just its capabilities, but how it is actually being adopted. This study investigates which intrinsic task characteristics drive users' decisions to delegate work to AI systems. Methodology: This study utilizes the Anthropic Economic Index dataset of four million Claude AI interactions mapped to O*NET tasks. We systematically scored each task across seven key dimensions: Routine, Cognitive, Social Intelligence, Creativity, Domain Knowledge, Complexity, and Decision Making using 35 parameters. We then employed multivariate techniques to identify latent task archetypes and analyzed their relationship with AI usage. Findings: Tasks requiring high creativity, complexity, and cognitive demand, but low routineness, attracted the most AI engagement. Furthermore, we identified three task archetypes: Dynamic Problem Solving, Procedural & Analytical Work, and Standardized Operational Tasks, demonstrating that AI applicability is best predicted by a combination of task characteristics, over individual factors. Our analysis revealed highly concentrated AI usage patterns, with just 5% of tasks accounting for 59% of all interactions. Originality: This research provides the first systematic evidence linking real-world generative AI usage to a comprehensive, multi-dimensional framework of intrinsic task characteristics. It introduces a data-driven classification of work archetypes that offers a new framework for analyzing the emerging human-AI division of labor.",

        "summary": "The emergence of Agentic AI is fundamentally transforming how software is designed, developed, and maintained. Traditional software development methodologies such as Agile, Kanban, ShapeUp, etc, were originally designed for human-centric teams and are increasingly inadequate in environments where autonomous AI agents contribute to planning, coding, testing, and continuous learning. To address this methodological gap, we present \"Agentsway\" a novel software development framework designed for ecosystems where AI agents operate as first-class collaborators. Agentsway introduces a structured lifecycle centered on human orchestration, and privacy-preserving collaboration among specialized AI agents. The framework defines distinct roles for planning, prompting, coding, testing, and fine-tuning agents, each contributing to iterative improvement and adaptive learning throughout the development process. By integrating fine-tuned LLMs that leverage outputs and feedback from different agents throughout the development cycle as part of a retrospective learning process, Agentsway enhances domain-specific reasoning, and explainable decision-making across the entire software development lifecycle. Responsible AI principles are further embedded across the agents through the coordinated use of multiple fine-tuned LLMs and advanced reasoning models, ensuring balanced, transparent, and accountable decision-making. This work advances software engineering by formalizing agent-centric collaboration, integrating privacy-by-design principles, and defining measurable metrics for productivity and trust. Agentsway represents a foundational step toward the next generation of AI-native, self-improving software development methodologies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research effort to introduce a dedicated methodology explicitly designed for AI agent-based software engineering teams.",

        "summary": "Detecting automated accounts (bots) among genuine users on platforms like Twitter remains a challenging task due to the evolving behaviors and adaptive strategies of such accounts. While recent methods have achieved strong detection performance by combining text, metadata, and user relationship information within graph-based frameworks, many of these models heavily depend on explicit user-user relationship data. This reliance limits their applicability in scenarios where such information is unavailable. To address this limitation, we propose a novel multimodal framework that integrates detailed textual features with enriched user metadata while employing graph-based reasoning without requiring follower-following data. Our method uses transformer-based models (e.g., BERT) to extract deep semantic embeddings from tweets, which are aggregated using max pooling to form comprehensive user-level representations. These are further combined with auxiliary behavioral features and passed through a GraphSAGE model to capture both local and global patterns in user behavior. Experimental results on the Cresci-15, Cresci-17, and PAN 2019 datasets demonstrate the robustness of our approach, achieving accuracies of 99.8%, 99.1%, and 96.8%, respectively, and highlighting its effectiveness against increasingly sophisticated bot strategies.",

Here, we integrate classical machine learning and deep learning to predict metastatic potential across multiple cancer types. Gene expression profiles from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia were combined with a transcription factor-target prior from DoRothEA, focusing on nine metastasis-associated regulators. After selecting differential genes using the Kruskal-Wallis test, ElasticNet, Random Forest, and XGBoost models were trained for benchmarking. Personalized gene regulatory networks were then constructed using PANDA and LIONESS and analyzed through a graph attention neural network (GATv2) to learn topological and expression-based representations. While XGBoost achieved the highest AUROC (0.7051), the GNN captured non-linear regulatory dependencies at the patient level. These results demonstrate that combining traditional machine learning with graph-based deep learning enables a scalable and interpretable framework for metastasis risk prediction in precision oncology.",

        "summary": "This paper investigates the integration of response time data into human preference learning frameworks for more effective reward model elicitation. While binary preference data has become fundamental in fine-tuning foundation models, generative AI systems, and other large-scale models, the valuable temporal information inherent in user decision-making remains largely unexploited. We propose novel methodologies to incorporate response time information alongside binary choice data, leveraging the Evidence Accumulation Drift Diffusion (EZ) model, under which response time is informative of the preference strength. We develop Neyman-orthogonal loss functions that achieve oracle convergence rates for reward model learning, matching the theoretical optimal rates that would be attained if the expected response times for each query were known a priori. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that for linear reward functions, conventional preference learning suffers from error rates that scale exponentially with reward magnitude. In contrast, our response time-augmented approach reduces this to polynomial scaling, representing a significant improvement in sample efficiency. We extend these guarantees to non-parametric reward function spaces, establishing convergence properties for more complex, realistic reward models. Our extensive experiments validate our theoretical findings in the context of preference learning over images.",
