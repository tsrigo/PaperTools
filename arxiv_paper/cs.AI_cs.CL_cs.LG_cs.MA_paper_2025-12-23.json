        "summary": "In formal strategic reasoning for Multi-Agent Systems (MAS), agents are typically assumed to (i) employ arbitrarily complex strategies, (ii) execute each move at zero cost, and (iii) operate over fully crisp game structures. These idealized assumptions stand in stark contrast with human decision making in real world environments. The natural strategies framework along with some of its recent variants, partially addresses this gap by restricting strategies to concise rules guarded by regular expressions. Yet, it still overlook both the cost of each action and the uncertainty that often characterizes human perception of facts over the time. In this work, we introduce HumanATLF, a logic that builds upon natural strategies employing both fuzzy semantics and resource bound actions: each action carries a real valued cost drawn from a non refillable budget, and atomic conditions and goals have degrees in [0,1]. We give a formal syntax and semantics, and prove that model checking is in P when both the strategy complexity k and resource budget b are fixed, NP complete if just one strategic operator over Boolean objectives is allowed, and Delta^P_2 complete when k and b vary. Moreover, we show that recall based strategies can be decided in PSPACE. We implement our algorithms in VITAMIN, an open source model checking tool for MAS and validate them on an adversarial resource aware drone rescue scenario.",

        "summary": "Work-in-Progress (WiP) prediction is critical for predictive process monitoring, enabling accurate anticipation of workload fluctuations and optimized operational planning. This paper proposes a retrieval-augmented, multi-agent framework that combines retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and collaborative multi-agent reasoning for WiP prediction. The narrative generation component transforms structured event logs into semantically rich natural language stories, which are embedded into a semantic vector-based process memory to facilitate dynamic retrieval of historical context during inference. The framework includes predictor agents that independently leverage retrieved historical contexts and a decision-making assistant agent that extracts high-level descriptive signals from recent events. A fusion agent then synthesizes predictions using ReAct-style reasoning over agent outputs and retrieved narratives. We evaluate our framework on two real-world benchmark datasets. Results show that the proposed retrieval-augmented multi-agent approach achieves competitive prediction accuracy, obtaining a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 1.50\\% on one dataset, and surpassing Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and persistence baselines. The results highlight improved robustness, demonstrating the effectiveness of integrating retrieval mechanisms and multi-agent reasoning in WiP prediction.",

However, many methods still compress content into lossy summaries or rely on limited toolsets, weakening temporal grounding and missing fine-grained cues. We propose a multi-agent framework in which a master LLM coordinates a grounding agent to localize question-relevant segments and a vision agent to extract targeted textual observations. The master agent plans with a step limit, and is trained with reinforcement learning to encourage concise, correct, and efficient multi-agent cooperation. This design helps the master agent focus on relevant clips via grounding, complements subtitles with visual detail, and yields interpretable trajectories. On our proposed LongTVQA and LongTVQA+ which are episode-level datasets aggregated from TVQA/TVQA+, our multi-agent system significantly outperforms strong non-agent baselines. Experiments also show reinforcement learning further strengthens reasoning and planning for the trained agent. Code and data will be shared at https://longvideoagent.github.io/.",

We evaluate our approach on a new real-world dataset from Bloomington, Indiana with topologically accurate road networks, census-derived demand, and existing transit routes. Our learned policies substantially outperform existing designs and traditional heuristics across two initialization schemes and two modal-split scenarios. Under high transit adoption with transit center initialization, our approach achieves 25.6% higher service rates, 30.9\\% shorter wait times, and 21.0% better bus utilization compared to the real-world network. Under mixed-mode conditions with random initialization, it delivers 68.8% higher route efficiency than demand coverage heuristics and 5.9% lower travel times than shortest path construction. These results demonstrate that end-to-end RL can design transit networks that substantially outperform both human-designed systems and hand-crafted heuristics on realistic city-scale benchmarks.",

Though rarely evaluated in healthcare, an inverse approach is possible: AI benefiting from the support of an expert human agent. Here, we investigate both human-AI clinical partnership paradigms in the magnetic resonance imaging-guided characterisation of patients with brain tumours. We reveal that human-AI partnerships improve accuracy and metacognitive ability not only for radiologists supported by AI, but also for AI agents supported by radiologists. Moreover, the greatest patient benefit was evident with an AI agent supported by a human one. Synergistic improvements in agent accuracy, metacognitive performance, and inter-rater agreement suggest that AI can create more capable, confident, and consistent clinical agents, whether human or model-based. Our work suggests that the maximal value of AI in healthcare could emerge not from replacing human intelligence, but from AI agents that routinely leverage and amplify it.",

The benchmark decomposes performance into five skills: (i) reconstructing cube faces from images and text, (ii) choosing the optimal next move, (iii) predicting the outcome of a candidate move without applying it, (iv) executing multi-step plans while recovering from mistakes, and (v) detecting and revising one's own errors. Using a shared set of scrambled cube states, identical prompts and parsers, and a single distance-to-solved metric, we compare recent MLLMs side by side as a function of scramble depth. Across seven MLLMs, accuracy drops sharply with depth; once a trajectory stalls or diverges, models rarely recover, and high face-reconstruction accuracy does not guarantee competent action selection or multi-step execution. A pronounced closed- vs open-source gap emerges: the strongest closed model leads on both single-step perception tasks and multi-step control tasks, while open-weight models cluster near chance on the hardest settings; yet even the best MLLM degrades at higher cube complexity. A simple self-correction via reflective thinking yields modest gains but can also introduce overthinking. Cube Bench offers a compact, reproducible probe of sequential spatial reasoning in MLLMs.",

Existing approaches typically rely on external judges, multi-sample consistency, or text-based self-critique, which incur additional compute or correlate weakly with true correctness. We ask: can LLMs predict their own failures by inspecting internal states during inference? We introduce Gnosis, a lightweight self-awareness mechanism that enables frozen LLMs to perform intrinsic self-verification by decoding signals from hidden states and attention patterns. Gnosis passively observes internal traces, compresses them into fixed-budget descriptors, and predicts correctness with negligible inference cost, adding only ~5M parameters and operating independently of sequence length. Across math reasoning, open-domain question answering, and academic knowledge benchmarks, and over frozen backbones ranging from 1.7B to 20B parameters, Gnosis consistently outperforms strong internal baselines and large external judges in both accuracy and calibration. Moreover, it generalizes zero-shot to partial generations, enabling early detection of failing trajectories and compute-aware control. These results show that reliable correctness cues are intrinsic to generation process and can be extracted efficiently without external supervision.",

A critical factor in the conversion process is layer selection, i.e., deciding on which layers to convert to linear attention variants. This paper describes a simple and efficient recipe for layer selection that uses layer importance scores derived from a small amount of training on generic text data. Once the layers have been selected we use a recent pipeline for the distillation process itself \\citep[RADLADS;][]{goldstein2025radlads}, which consists of attention weight transfer, hidden state alignment, KL-based distribution matching, followed by a small amount of finetuning. We find that this approach is more effective than existing approaches for layer selection, including heuristics that uniformly interleave linear attentions based on a fixed ratio, as well as more involved approaches that rely on specialized diagnostic datasets.",

We present a multi-perspective validation framework for LLM-based thematic analysis that combines ensemble validation with dual reliability metrics: Cohen's Kappa ($κ$) for inter-rater agreement and cosine similarity for semantic consistency. Our framework enables configurable analysis parameters (1-6 seeds, temperature 0.0-2.0), supports custom prompt structures with variable substitution, and provides consensus theme extraction across any JSON format.

Results demonstrate Gemini achieves highest reliability ($κ= 0.907$, cosine=95.3%), followed by GPT-4o ($κ= 0.853$, cosine=92.6%) and Claude ($κ= 0.842$, cosine=92.1%). All three models achieve a high agreement ($κ> 0.80$), validating the multi-run ensemble approach.

This requires extracting semantic representations directly from speech. Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce SpidR, a self-supervised speech representation model that efficiently learns representations with highly accessible phonetic information, which makes it particularly suited for textless spoken language modeling. It is trained on raw waveforms using a masked prediction objective combined with self-distillation and online clustering. The intermediate layers of the student model learn to predict assignments derived from the teacher's intermediate layers. This learning objective stabilizes the online clustering procedure compared to previous approaches, resulting in higher quality codebooks. SpidR outperforms wav2vec 2.0, HuBERT, WavLM, and DinoSR on downstream language modeling benchmarks (sWUGGY, sBLIMP, tSC). Second, we systematically evaluate across models and layers the correlation between speech unit quality (ABX, PNMI) and language modeling performance, validating these metrics as reliable proxies. Finally, SpidR significantly reduces pretraining time compared to HuBERT, requiring only one day of pretraining on 16 GPUs, instead of a week. This speedup is enabled by the pretraining method and an efficient codebase, which allows faster iteration and easier experimentation. We open-source the training code and model checkpoints at https://github.com/facebookresearch/spidr.",

While both models and human experts excelled at identifying BPD (F1 = 83.4 & F1 = 80.0, respectively), models severely underdiagnosed NPD (F1 = 6.7 vs. 50.0), showing a reluctance toward the value-laden term \"narcissism.\" Qualitatively, models provided confident, elaborate justifications focused on patterns and formal categories, while human experts remained concise and cautious, emphasizing the patient's sense of self and temporal experience. Our findings demonstrate that while LLMs are highly competent at interpreting complex first-person clinical data, they remain subject to critical reliability and bias issues.",

We introduce AprielGuard, an 8B parameter safeguard model that unify these dimensions within a single taxonomy and learning framework. AprielGuard is trained on a diverse mix of open and synthetic data covering standalone prompts, multi-turn conversations, and agentic workflows, augmented with structured reasoning traces to improve interpretability. Across multiple public and proprietary benchmarks, AprielGuard achieves strong performance in detecting harmful content and adversarial manipulations, outperforming existing opensource guardrails such as Llama-Guard and Granite Guardian, particularly in multi-step and reasoning intensive scenarios.

We introduce a novel task that conditions paper-to-slides generation on user-specified preferences. We propose a human behavior-inspired agentic framework, SlideTailor, that progressively generates editable slides in a user-aligned manner. Instead of requiring users to write their preferences in detailed textual form, our system only asks for a paper-slides example pair and a visual template - natural and easy-to-provide artifacts that implicitly encode rich user preferences across content and visual style. Despite the implicit and unlabeled nature of these inputs, our framework effectively distills and generalizes the preferences to guide customized slide generation. We also introduce a novel chain-of-speech mechanism to align slide content with planned oral narration. Such a design significantly enhances the quality of generated slides and enables downstream applications like video presentations. To support this new task, we construct a benchmark dataset that captures diverse user preferences, with carefully designed interpretable metrics for robust evaluation.

Notably, while defenses may exist for mature domains such as code review, they are often absent in other common applications such as resume screening and peer review. This paper introduces a benchmark to assess this vulnerability in resume screening, revealing attack success rates exceeding 80% for certain attack types. We evaluate two defense mechanisms: prompt-based defenses achieve 10.1% attack reduction with 12.5% false rejection increase, while our proposed FIDS (Foreign Instruction Detection through Separation) using LoRA adaptation achieves 15.4% attack reduction with 10.4% false rejection increase.

However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions.

Researchers have effectively employed the ``pre-train, prompt, and predict'' paradigm through prompt learning to induce improved few-shot performance. However, prompt learning approaches for PFMs still follow a parametric learning paradigm. As such, the stability of generalization in memorization and rote learning can be compromised. More specifically, conventional prompt learning might face difficulties in fully utilizing atypical instances and avoiding overfitting to shallow patterns with limited data during the process of fully-supervised training. To overcome these constraints, we present our approach, named RetroPrompt, which aims to achieve a balance between memorization and generalization by decoupling knowledge from mere memorization. Unlike traditional prompting methods, RetroPrompt leverages a publicly accessible knowledge base generated from the training data and incorporates a retrieval mechanism throughout the input, training, and inference stages. This enables the model to actively retrieve relevant contextual information from the corpus, thereby enhancing the available cues. We conduct comprehensive experiments on a variety of datasets across natural language processing and computer vision tasks to demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed approach, RetroPrompt, in both zero-shot and few-shot scenarios. Through detailed analysis of memorization patterns, we observe that RetroPrompt effectively reduces the reliance on rote memorization, leading to enhanced generalization.",

        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs) to address knowledge-intensive queries requiring domain-specific or up-to-date information. To handle complex multi-hop questions that are challenging for single-step retrieval, iterative RAG approaches incorporating reinforcement learning have been proposed. However, existing iterative RAG systems typically plan to decompose questions without leveraging information about the available retrieval corpus, leading to inefficient retrieval and reasoning chains that cascade into suboptimal performance. In this paper, we introduce Early Knowledge Alignment (EKA), a simple but effective module that aligns LLMs with retrieval set before planning in iterative RAG systems with contextually relevant retrieved knowledge. Extensive experiments on six standard RAG datasets demonstrate that by establishing a stronger reasoning foundation, EKA significantly improves retrieval precision, reduces cascading errors, and enhances both performance and efficiency. Our analysis from an entropy perspective demonstrate that incorporating early knowledge reduces unnecessary exploration during the reasoning process, enabling the model to focus more effectively on relevant information subsets. Moreover, EKA proves effective as a versatile, training-free inference strategy that scales seamlessly to large models. Generalization tests across diverse datasets and retrieval corpora confirm the robustness of our approach. Overall, EKA advances the state-of-the-art in iterative RAG systems while illuminating the critical interplay between structured reasoning and efficient exploration in reinforcement learning-augmented frameworks.

        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has recently been extended to multimodal settings, connecting multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with vast corpora of external knowledge such as multimodal knowledge graphs (MMKGs). Despite their recent success, multimodal RAG in the audio-visual domain remains challenging due to 1) limited modality coverage and multi-hop connectivity of existing MMKGs, and 2) retrieval based solely on similarity in a shared multimodal embedding space, which fails to filter out off-topic or redundant knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose M$^3$KG-RAG, a Multi-hop Multimodal Knowledge Graph-enhanced RAG that retrieves query-aligned audio-visual knowledge from MMKGs, improving reasoning depth and answer faithfulness in MLLMs. Specifically, we devise a lightweight multi-agent pipeline to construct multi-hop MMKG (M$^3$KG), which contains context-enriched triplets of multimodal entities, enabling modality-wise retrieval based on input queries. Furthermore, we introduce GRASP (Grounded Retrieval And Selective Pruning), which ensures precise entity grounding to the query, evaluates answer-supporting relevance, and prunes redundant context to retain only knowledge essential for response generation. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that M$^3$KG-RAG significantly enhances MLLMs' multimodal reasoning and grounding over existing approaches.",

We introduce a general framework for LLM agents to maintain concise contexts through multi-step interaction: Acting through Belief Bottlenecks Expressed in Language (ABBEL), and methods to further improve ABBEL agents with RL post-training. ABBEL replaces long multi-step interaction history by a belief state, i.e., a natural language summary of what has been discovered about task-relevant unknowns. Under ABBEL, at each step the agent first updates a prior belief with the most recent observation from the environment to form a posterior belief, then uses only the posterior to select an action. We systematically evaluate frontier models under ABBEL across six diverse multi-step environments, finding that ABBEL supports generating interpretable beliefs while maintaining near-constant memory use over interaction steps. However, bottleneck approaches are generally prone to error propagation, which we observe causing inferior performance when compared to the full context setting due to errors in belief updating. Therefore, we train LLMs to generate and act on beliefs within the ABBEL framework via reinforcement learning (RL). We experiment with belief grading, to reward higher quality beliefs, as well as belief length penalties to reward more compressed beliefs. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of RL to improve ABBEL's performance beyond the full context setting, while using less memory than contemporaneous approaches.",

        "summary": "Text classification plays an important role in various downstream text-related tasks, such as sentiment analysis, fake news detection, and public opinion analysis. Recently, text classification based on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) has made significant progress due to their strong capabilities of structural relationship learning. However, these approaches still face two major limitations. First, these approaches fail to fully consider the diverse structural information across word pairs, e.g., co-occurrence, syntax, and semantics. Furthermore, they neglect sequence information in the text graph structure information learning module and can not classify texts with new words and relations. In this paper, we propose a Novel Graph-Sequence Learning Model for Inductive Text Classification (TextGSL) to address the previously mentioned issues. More specifically, we construct a single text-level graph for all words in each text and establish different edge types based on the diverse relationships between word pairs. Building upon this, we design an adaptive multi-edge message-passing paradigm to aggregate diverse structural information between word pairs. Additionally, sequential information among text data can be captured by the proposed TextGSL through the incorporation of Transformer layers. Therefore, TextGSL can learn more discriminative text representations. TextGSL has been comprehensively compared with several strong baselines. The experimental results on diverse benchmarking datasets demonstrate that TextGSL outperforms these baselines in terms of accuracy.",

        "summary": "Temporal reasoning over long, multi-session dialogues is a critical capability for conversational agents. However, existing works and our pilot study have shown that as dialogue histories grow in length and accumulate noise, current long-context models struggle to accurately identify temporally pertinent information, significantly impairing reasoning performance. To address this, we introduce Memory-T1, a framework that learns a time-aware memory selection policy using reinforcement learning (RL). It employs a coarse-to-fine strategy, first pruning the dialogue history into a candidate set using temporal and relevance filters, followed by an RL agent that selects the precise evidence sessions. The RL training is guided by a multi-level reward function optimizing (i) answer accuracy, (ii) evidence grounding, and (iii) temporal consistency. In particular, the temporal consistency reward provides a dense signal by evaluating alignment with the query time scope at both the session-level (chronological proximity) and the utterance-level (chronological fidelity), enabling the agent to resolve subtle chronological ambiguities. On the Time-Dialog benchmark, Memory-T1 boosts a 7B model to an overall score of 67.0\\%, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for open-source models and outperforming a 14B baseline by 10.2\\%. Ablation studies show temporal consistency and evidence grounding rewards jointly contribute to a 15.0\\% performance gain. Moreover, Memory-T1 maintains robustness up to 128k tokens, where baseline models collapse, proving effectiveness against noise in extensive dialogue histories.

We further present two diagnostic case studies showing that exploration functions as a critical branching step associated with correctness, and that efficiency-oriented methods selectively suppress evaluative feedback steps rather than uniformly shortening responses.

The novelty of this research lies in the integration of controllable large language model based dialogue synthesis with tone classification models, enabling robust and ethical emotion recognition in personal assistant interactions. We created two synthetic dialogue datasets, one generated from neutral prompts and another explicitly guided to produce positive or negative tones. Surprisingly, even the neutral set showed consistent tonal skew, suggesting that bias may stem from the model's underlying conversational style. Using weak supervision through a pretrained DistilBERT model, we labeled tones and trained several classifiers to detect these patterns. Ensemble models achieved macro F1 scores up to 0.92, showing that tone bias is systematic, measurable, and relevant to designing fair and trustworthy conversational AI.",

To address this challenge, we introduce the Personality-Refracted Intelligent Simulation Model (PRISM), a hybrid framework coupling stochastic differential equations (SDE) for continuous emotional evolution with a personality-conditional partially observable Markov decision process (PC-POMDP) for discrete decision-making. In contrast to continuous trait approaches, PRISM assigns distinct Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) based cognitive policies to multimodal large language model (MLLM) agents, initialized via data-driven priors from large-scale social media datasets. PRISM achieves superior personality consistency aligned with human ground truth, significantly outperforming standard homogeneous and Big Five benchmarks. This framework effectively replicates emergent phenomena such as rational suppression and affective resonance, offering a robust tool for analyzing complex social media ecosystems.",

        "summary": "The rise of AI has fueled growing concerns about ``hype'' in machine learning papers, yet a reliable way to quantify rhetorical style independently of substantive content has remained elusive. Because bold language can stem from either strong empirical results or mere rhetorical style, it is often difficult to distinguish between the two. To disentangle rhetorical style from substantive content, we introduce a counterfactual, LLM-based framework: multiple LLM rhetorical personas generate counterfactual writings from the same substantive content, an LLM judge compares them through pairwise evaluations, and the outcomes are aggregated using a Bradley--Terry model. Applying this method to 8,485 ICLR submissions sampled from 2017 to 2025, we generate more than 250,000 counterfactual writings and provide a large-scale quantification of rhetorical style in ML papers. We find that visionary framing significantly predicts downstream attention, including citations and media attention, even after controlling for peer-review evaluations. We also observe a sharp rise in rhetorical strength after 2023, and provide empirical evidence showing that this increase is largely driven by the adoption of LLM-based writing assistance. The reliability of our framework is validated by its robustness to the choice of personas and the high correlation between LLM judgments and human annotations. Our work demonstrates that LLMs can serve as instruments to measure and improve scientific evaluation.",

While prior work has investigated how models can be adapted or optimized for specific tasks, far less is known about how well LLMs perform at interpreting authentic educational scenarios without significant customization. As LLM-based systems become widely adopted by learners and educators in everyday academic contexts, understanding their out-of-the-box capabilities is increasingly important for setting expectations and benchmarking. We compared six LLMs to estimate their baseline performance on a simple but important task: classifying instructional moves in authentic classroom transcripts. We evaluated typical prompting methods: zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting. We found that while zero-shot performance was moderate, providing comprehensive examples (few-shot prompting) significantly improved performance for state-of-the-art models, with the strongest configuration reaching Cohen's Kappa = 0.58 against expert-coded annotations. At the same time, improvements were neither uniform nor complete: performance varied considerably by instructional move, and higher recall frequently came at the cost of increased false positives. Overall, these findings indicate that foundation models demonstrate meaningful yet limited capacity to interpret instructional discourse, with prompt design helping to surface capability but not eliminating fundamental reliability constraints.",

        "summary": "Unstructured notes within the electronic health record (EHR) contain rich clinical information vital for cancer treatment decision making and research, yet reliably extracting structured oncology data remains challenging due to extensive variability, specialized terminology, and inconsistent document formats. Manual abstraction, although accurate, is prohibitively costly and unscalable. Existing automated approaches typically address narrow scenarios - either using synthetic datasets, restricting focus to document-level extraction, or isolating specific clinical variables (e.g., staging, biomarkers, histology) - and do not adequately handle patient-level synthesis across the large number of clinical documents containing contradictory information. In this study, we propose an agentic framework that systematically decomposes complex oncology data extraction into modular, adaptive tasks. Specifically, we use large language models (LLMs) as reasoning agents, equipped with context-sensitive retrieval and iterative synthesis capabilities, to exhaustively and comprehensively extract structured clinical variables from real-world oncology notes. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset of over 400,000 unstructured clinical notes and scanned PDF reports spanning 2,250 cancer patients, our method achieves an average F1-score of 0.93, with 100 out of 103 oncology-specific clinical variables exceeding 0.85, and critical variables (e.g., biomarkers and medications) surpassing 0.95. Moreover, integration of the agentic system into a data curation workflow resulted in 0.94 direct manual approval rate, significantly reducing annotation costs. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first exhaustive, end-to-end application of LLM-based agents for structured oncology data extraction at scale",

While prior studies have revealed significant layer redundancy in LLMs for generative tasks, it remains unclear whether similar redundancy exists when these models are adapted for retrieval tasks, which require encoding entire sequences into fixed representations rather than generating tokens iteratively. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of layer redundancy in LLM-based dense retrievers. We find that, in contrast to generative settings, MLP layers are substantially more prunable, while attention layers remain critical for semantic aggregation. Building on this insight, we propose EffiR, a framework for developing efficient retrievers that performs large-scale MLP compression through a coarse-to-fine strategy (coarse-grained depth reduction followed by fine-grained width reduction), combined with retrieval-specific fine-tuning. Across diverse BEIR datasets and LLM backbones, EffiR achieves substantial reductions in model size and inference cost while preserving the performance of full-size models.",

We developed SAGE (Secure Agent for Generative Dose Expertise), an LLM-based planning agent for automated SRS treatment planning. Two variants generated plans for each case: one using a non-reasoning model, one using a reasoning model. The reasoning variant showed comparable plan dosimetry relative to human planners on primary endpoints (PTV coverage, maximum dose, conformity index, gradient index; all p > 0.21) while reducing cochlear dose below human baselines (p = 0.022). When prompted to improve conformity, the reasoning model demonstrated systematic planning behaviors including prospective constraint verification (457 instances) and trade-off deliberation (609 instances), while the standard model exhibited none of these deliberative processes (0 and 7 instances, respectively). Content analysis revealed that constraint verification and causal explanation concentrated in the reasoning agent.

Despite their centrality to language and thought, how these processes are implemented in the human brain during naturalistic listening remains unclear. Here, we tested whether these two processes can be captured by annotation-free drift and shift signals and whether their neural expression dissociates across large-scale cortical systems. These signals were derived from a large language model (LLM) and formalized contextual drift and event shifts directly from the narrative input. To enable high-precision voxelwise encoding models with stable parameter estimates, we densely sampled one healthy adult across more than 7 hours of listening to thirteen crime stories while collecting ultra high-field (7T) BOLD data. We then modeled the feature-informed hemodynamic response using a regularized encoding framework validated on independent stories. Drift predictions were prevalent in default-mode network hubs, whereas shift predictions were evident bilaterally in the primary auditory cortex and language association cortex. Furthermore, activity in default-mode and parietal networks was best explained by a signal capturing how meaning accumulates and gradually fades over the course of the narrative. Together, these findings show that coherence during language comprehension is implemented through dissociable neural regimes of slow contextual integration and rapid event-driven reconfiguration, offering a mechanistic entry point for understanding disturbances of language coherence in psychiatric disorders.",

Existing DIR methods are primarily based on image queries that retrieve documents within the same coarse semantic category, e.g., newspapers or receipts.

To bridge this gap, we introduce a new Natural Language-based Document Image Retrieval (NL-DIR) benchmark with corresponding evaluation metrics. In this work, natural language descriptions serve as semantically rich queries for the DIR task. The NL-DIR dataset contains 41K authentic document images, each paired with five high-quality, fine-grained semantic queries generated and evaluated through large language models in conjunction with manual verification. We perform zero-shot and fine-tuning evaluations of existing mainstream contrastive vision-language models and OCR-free visual document understanding (VDU) models. A two-stage retrieval method is further investigated for performance improvement while achieving both time and space efficiency. We hope the proposed NL-DIR benchmark can bring new opportunities and facilitate research for the VDU community.

In Stage-1, our model is trained on rationale generation, while in Stage-2, we jointly train on label prediction and rationale generation, applying scheduled sampling to gradually transition from conditioning on gold labels to model predictions. We evaluate Reason2Decide on three medical datasets, including a proprietary triage dataset and public biomedical QA datasets. Across model sizes, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning baselines and some zero-shot LLMs in prediction (F1) and rationale fidelity (BERTScore, BLEU, LLM-as-a-Judge). In triage, Reason2Decide is rationale source-robust across LLM-generated, nurse-authored, and nurse-post-processed rationales. In our experiments, while using only LLM-generated rationales in Stage-1, Reason2Decide outperforms other fine-tuning variants. This indicates that LLM-generated rationales are suitable for pretraining models, reducing reliance on human annotations. Remarkably, Reason2Decide achieves these gains with models 40x smaller than contemporary foundation models, making clinical reasoning more accessible for resource-constrained deployments while still providing explainable decision support.",

We propose using human brain activity not as a training signal but as a coordinate system for reading and steering LLM states. Using the SMN4Lang MEG dataset, we construct a word-level brain atlas of phase-locking value (PLV) patterns and extract latent axes via ICA. We validate axes with independent lexica and NER-based labels (POS/log-frequency used as sanity checks), then train lightweight adapters that map LLM hidden states to these brain axes without fine-tuning the LLM. Steering along the resulting brain-derived directions yields a robust lexical (frequency-linked) axis in a mid TinyLlama layer, surviving perplexity-matched controls, and a brain-vs-text probe comparison shows larger log-frequency shifts (relative to the text probe) with lower perplexity for the brain axis. A function/content axis (axis 13) shows consistent steering in TinyLlama, Qwen2-0.5B, and GPT-2, with PPL-matched text-level corroboration. Layer-4 effects in TinyLlama are large but inconsistent, so we treat them as secondary (Appendix). Axis structure is stable when the atlas is rebuilt without GPT embedding-change features or with word2vec embeddings (|r|=0.64-0.95 across matched axes), reducing circularity concerns. Exploratory fMRI anchoring suggests potential alignment for embedding change and log frequency, but effects are sensitive to hemodynamic modeling assumptions and are treated as population-level evidence only. These results support a new interface: neurophysiology-grounded axes provide interpretable and controllable handles for LLM behavior.",

Here, simple means expressible with few hidden units, i.e., hidden neurons, convolutional kernels, or attention heads. Specifically, we show that linear networks learn solutions of increasing rank, ReLU networks learn solutions with an increasing number of kinks, convolutional networks learn solutions with an increasing number of convolutional kernels, and self-attention models learn solutions with an increasing number of attention heads. By analyzing fixed points, invariant manifolds, and dynamics of gradient descent learning, we show that saddle-to-saddle dynamics operates by iteratively evolving near an invariant manifold, approaching a saddle, and switching to another invariant manifold. Our analysis also illuminates the effects of data distribution and weight initialization on the duration and number of plateaus in learning, dissociating previously confounding factors.

During RL, these models explore by generating new outputs, one token at a time. However, sampling actions token-by-token can result in highly inefficient learning, particularly when rewards are sparse. Here, we show that it is possible to overcome this problem by acting and exploring within the internal representations of an autoregressive model. Specifically, to discover temporally-abstract actions, we introduce a higher-order, non-causal sequence model whose outputs control the residual stream activations of a base autoregressive model. On grid world and MuJoCo-based tasks with hierarchical structure, we find that the higher-order model learns to compress long activation sequence chunks onto internal controllers. Critically, each controller executes a sequence of behaviorally meaningful actions that unfold over long timescales and are accompanied with a learned termination condition, such that composing multiple controllers over time leads to efficient exploration on novel tasks. We show that direct internal controller reinforcement, a process we term \"internal RL\", enables learning from sparse rewards in cases where standard RL finetuning fails. Our results demonstrate the benefits of latent action generation and reinforcement in autoregressive models, suggesting internal RL as a promising avenue for realizing hierarchical RL within foundation models.",

The game runs in the direction opposite to that of the network, and the input of the network serves as the terminal reward of the game. In fact, evaluating the network is the same as running the Shapley-Bellman backward recursion for the value of the game. Using the expression of the value of the game as an expected total payoff with respect to the path measure induced by the transition probabilities and a pair of optimal policies, we derive a discrete Feynman-Kac-type path-integral formula for the network output. This game-theoretic representation can be used to derive bounds on the output from bounds on the input, leveraging the monotonicity of Shapley operators, and to verify robustness properties using policies as certificates. Moreover, training the neural network becomes an inverse game problem: given pairs of terminal rewards and corresponding values, one seeks transition probabilities and rewards of a game that reproduces them. Finally, we show that a similar approach applies to neural networks with Softplus activation functions, where the ReLU net game is replaced by its entropic regularization.",

We also show one way a tagging project can collect high-quality training data without requiring multiple tags for every work item, and that a tagger burn-in period may not be sufficient for minimizing tagger errors.",

While designing optimal algorithms in this performative setting has recently been studied in supervised learning, the RL counterpart remains under-explored. In this paper, we prove the performative counterparts of the performance difference lemma and the policy gradient theorem in RL, and further introduce the Performative Policy Gradient algorithm (PePG). PePG is the first policy gradient algorithm designed to account for performativity in RL. Under softmax parametrisation, and also with and without entropy regularisation, we prove that PePG converges to performatively optimal policies, i.e. policies that remain optimal under the distribution shifts induced by themselves. Thus, PePG significantly extends the prior works in Performative RL that achieves performative stability but not optimality. Furthermore, our empirical analysis on standard performative RL environments validate that PePG outperforms standard policy gradient algorithms and the existing performative RL algorithms aiming for stability.",

We show that, if carefully applied, the attributes of dLLMs can actually be a strength for drafters in speculative decoding with autoregressive (AR) verifiers. Our core insight is that dLLM's speed from parallel decoding drastically lowers the risk of costly rejections, providing a practical mechanism to effectively realize the (elusive) lengthy drafts that lead to large speedups with speculative decoding. We present FailFast, a dLLM-based speculative decoding framework that realizes this approach by dynamically adapting its speculation length. It \"fails fast\" by spending minimal compute in hard-to-speculate regions to shrink speculation latency and \"wins big\" by aggressively extending draft lengths in easier regions to reduce verification latency (in many cases, speculating and accepting 70 tokens at a time!). Without any fine-tuning, FailFast delivers lossless acceleration of AR LLMs and achieves up to 4.9$\\times$ speedup over vanilla decoding, 1.7$\\times$ over the best naive dLLM drafter, and 1.4$\\times$ over EAGLE-3 across diverse models and workloads.

Moreover, its learned gates provide a natural framework for analyzing MTL dynamics, offering interpretable insights into capacity allocation, filter specialization, and task relationships.

We introduce BRIDGE (Budget-Aware Reasoning via Intermediate Distillation), a two-phase framework that resolves these constraints through strategic intermediation and budget asymmetry. In Phase 1, a mid-sized Teacher Assistant (TA; e.g., about 7B) learns from the black-box teacher on a strictly limited subset of data (e.g., 3-5%), selected via a zero-API-cost pipeline that balances entropic difficulty and semantic diversity using only local TA inference. In Phase 2, we exploit this asymmetry-teacher queries are expensive, whereas TA inference is free to amplify supervision: the refined TA generates synthetic rationales for the full dataset to train the tiny student. Crucially, we apply an instruction-tuning curriculum to establish behavioral alignment in the tiny student before transferring reasoning. Our theoretical analysis shows that BRIDGE yields tighter generalization bounds than direct distillation when data is abundant. Experiments across medical, legal, and financial benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements: BRIDGE delivers student performance gains of 28-41%, closing the capability gap with proprietary teachers by 12-16% while using 10x fewer teacher queries. Notably, BRIDGE defies the conventional cost-performance frontier, surpassing direct distillation baselines that use 100% of the budget while consuming only 5% of the resources.",

We compute a weighted PSI metric, $WPSI^L$, which we show to be more informative than common non-IID metrics (Hellinger, Jensen-Shannon, and Earth Mover's distance). Using PSI features, we form distributionally homogeneous groups of clients via K-means++; the number of optimal clusters is chosen by a systematic silhouette-based procedure, typically yielding few clusters with modest overhead. Across six datasets (tabular, image, and text modalities), two partition protocols (Dirichlet with parameter $α$ and Similarity with parameter S), and multiple client sizes, Clust-PSI-PFL delivers up to 18% higher global accuracy than state-of-the-art baselines and markedly improves client fairness by a relative improvement of 37% under severe non-IID data.

By maintaining all intermediate representations as continuous fields on the sphere, the architecture enables interpretable internal states and facilitates the enforcement of scientific constraints. The model employs a fixed, non-learned multiscale decomposition and learns structure-preserving deformations of the input field, allowing coherent integration of coarse and fine-scale information while avoiding the optimization instabilities characteristic of standard single-scale Vision Transformers. Applied to global temperature super-resolution on a HEALPix grid, Field-Space Transformers converge more rapidly and stably than conventional Vision Transformers and U-Net baselines, while requiring substantially fewer parameters. The explicit preservation of field structure throughout the network allows physical and statistical priors to be embedded directly into the architecture, yielding improved fidelity and reliability in data-driven Earth system modeling.

        "summary": "Data heterogeneity is a significant challenge in modern federated learning (FL) as it creates variance in local model updates, causing the aggregated global model to shift away from the true global optimum. Partial client participation in FL further exacerbates this issue by skewing the aggregation of local models towards the data distribution of participating clients. This creates additional variance in the global model updates, causing the global model to converge away from the optima of the global objective. These variances lead to instability in FL training, which degrades global model performance and slows down FL training. While existing literature primarily focuses on addressing data heterogeneity, the impact of partial client participation has received less attention. In this paper, we propose FedDPC, a novel FL method, designed to improve FL training and global model performance by mitigating both data heterogeneity and partial client participation. FedDPC addresses these issues by projecting each local update onto the previous global update, thereby controlling variance in both local and global updates. To further accelerate FL training, FedDPC employs adaptive scaling for each local update before aggregation. Extensive experiments on image classification tasks with multiple heterogeneously partitioned datasets validate the effectiveness of FedDPC. The results demonstrate that FedDPC outperforms state-of-the-art FL algorithms by achieving faster reduction in training loss and improved test accuracy across communication rounds.",

While Large Language Models (LLMs) fine-tuned via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) have significantly improved natural language interaction with such structured data, they often fall short in handling the complex, multi-step reasoning and robust code execution required for real-world table tasks. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising avenue to enhance these capabilities, yet its application in the tabular domain faces three critical hurdles: the scarcity of high-quality agentic trajectories with closed-loop code execution and environment feedback on diverse table structures, the extreme heterogeneity of feedback signals ranging from rigid SQL execution to open-ended data interpretation, and the risk of catastrophic forgetting of general knowledge during vertical specialization. To overcome these challenges and unlock advanced reasoning on complex tables, we introduce \\textbf{TableGPT-R1}, a specialized tabular model built on a systematic RL framework. Our approach integrates a comprehensive data engineering pipeline that synthesizes difficulty-stratified agentic trajectories for both supervised alignment and RL rollouts, a task-adaptive reward system that combines rule-based verification with a criteria-injected reward model and incorporates process-level step reward shaping with behavioral regularization, and a multi-stage training framework that progressively stabilizes reasoning before specializing in table-specific tasks.

Grounded in the Universal Weight Subspace Hypothesis, CDSP-MoE maintains a super-complete parameter backbone where logical experts are carved out via learnable topology masks. Unlike prior work that uses gradient conflict for token reassignment or optimization surgery, we leverage it as a structural supervisory signal: a Lagged Gradient Game penalizes interfering connections in the shared manifold, enabling the topology to spontaneously prune conflicting pathways and evolve interpretable modular structures. Experimental results demonstrate that CDSP-MoE achieves robust content-driven routing without human-defined task labels, maintaining semantic specialization even under strict blind inference protocols where explicit instructions are absent.

Recent advances suggest that Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) offer a promising solution to learning the complex path distributions induced by SDEs. However, a critical bottleneck lies in designing a discriminator that faithfully captures temporal dependencies while remaining computationally efficient. Prior works have explored Neural Controlled Differential Equations (CDEs) as discriminators due to their ability to model continuous-time dynamics, but such architectures suffer from high computational costs and exacerbate the instability of adversarial training. To address these limitations, we introduce HGAN-SDEs, a novel GAN-based framework that leverages Neural Hermite functions to construct a structured and efficient discriminator. Hermite functions provide an expressive yet lightweight basis for approximating path-level dynamics, enabling both reduced runtime complexity and improved training stability. We establish the universal approximation property of our framework for a broad class of SDE-driven distributions and theoretically characterize its convergence behavior. Extensive empirical evaluations on synthetic and real-world systems demonstrate that HGAN-SDEs achieve superior sample quality and learning efficiency compared to existing generative models for SDEs",

        "summary": "This work demonstrates that neural operator learning provides a powerful and flexible framework for building fast, accurate emulators of moving boundary systems, enabling their integration into digital twin platforms. To this end, a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture is employed to construct an efficient surrogate model for moving boundary problems in single-phase Darcy flow through porous media. The surrogate enables rapid and accurate approximation of complex flow dynamics and is coupled with an Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) algorithm to solve Bayesian inverse problems. The proposed inversion framework is demonstrated by estimating the permeability and porosity of fibre reinforcements for composite materials manufactured via the Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) process. Using both synthetic and experimental in-process data, the DeepONet surrogate accelerates inversion by several orders of magnitude compared with full-model EKI. This computational efficiency enables real-time, accurate, high-resolution estimation of local variations in permeability, porosity, and other parameters, thereby supporting effective monitoring and control of RTM processes, as well as other applications involving moving boundary flows. Unlike prior approaches for RTM inversion that learn mesh-dependent mappings, the proposed neural operator generalises across spatial and temporal domains, enabling evaluation at arbitrary sensor configurations without retraining, and represents a significant step toward practical industrial deployment of digital twins.",

However, multimodal brain decoding still faces key challenges in cross-subject generalization and interpretability. We propose a BrainROI model and achieve leading-level results in brain-captioning evaluation on the NSD dataset. Under the cross-subject setting, compared with recent state-of-the-art methods and representative baselines, metrics such as BLEU-4 and CIDEr show clear improvements. Firstly, to address the heterogeneity of functional brain topology across subjects, we design a new fMRI encoder. We use multi-atlas soft functional parcellations (soft-ROI) as a shared space. We extend the discrete ROI Concatenation strategy in MINDLLM to a voxel-wise gated fusion mechanism (Voxel-gate). We also ensure consistent ROI mapping through global label alignment, which enhances cross-subject transferability. Secondly, to overcome the limitations of manual and black-box prompting methods in stability and transparency, we introduce an interpretable prompt optimization process. In a small-sample closed loop, we use a locally deployed Qwen model to iteratively generate and select human-readable prompts. This process improves the stability of prompt design and preserves an auditable optimization trajectory. Finally, we impose parameterized decoding constraints during inference to further improve the stability and quality of the generated descriptions.",

        "summary": "Simultaneous load forecasting across multiple entities (e.g., regions, buildings) is crucial for the efficient, reliable, and cost-effective operation of power systems. Accurate load forecasting is a challenging problem due to the inherent uncertainties in load demand, dynamic changes in consumption patterns, and correlations among entities. Multi-task learning has emerged as a powerful machine learning approach that enables the simultaneous learning across multiple related problems. However, its application to load forecasting remains underexplored and is limited to offline learning-based methods, which cannot capture changes in consumption patterns. This paper presents an adaptive multi-task learning method for probabilistic load forecasting. The proposed method can dynamically adapt to changes in consumption patterns and correlations among entities. In addition, the techniques presented provide reliable probabilistic predictions for loads of multiples entities and assess load uncertainties. Specifically, the method is based on vectorvalued hidden Markov models and uses a recursive process to update the model parameters and provide predictions with the most recent parameters. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated using datasets that contain the load demand of multiple entities and exhibit diverse and dynamic consumption patterns. The experimental results show that the presented techniques outperform existing methods both in terms of forecasting performance and uncertainty assessment.",

In this regime, a learner is provided with fixed datasets collected from several related tasks, without access to further online interaction, and seeks to exploit shared structure to improve statistical efficiency and generalization. We analyze a multitask variant of fitted Q-iteration that jointly learns a shared representation and task-specific value functions via Bellman error minimization on offline data. Under standard realizability and coverage assumptions commonly used in offline reinforcement learning, we establish finite-sample generalization guarantees for the learned value functions. Our analysis explicitly characterizes how pooling data across tasks improves estimation accuracy, yielding a $1/\\sqrt{nT}$ dependence on the total number of samples across tasks, while retaining the usual dependence on the horizon and concentrability coefficients arising from distribution shift. In addition, we consider a downstream offline setting in which a new task shares the same underlying representation as the upstream tasks. We study how reusing the representation learned during the multitask phase affects value estimation for this new task, and show that it can reduce the effective complexity of downstream learning relative to learning from scratch. Together, our results clarify the role of shared representations in multitask offline Q-learning and provide theoretical insight into when and how multitask structure can improve generalization in model-free, value-based reinforcement learning.",

They are a primary tool to quantify the impacts of climate change on agricultural productivity and assess associated risks for food security. Despite decades of development, state-of-the-art GGCMs still have substantial uncertainties in simulating complex biophysical processes due to limited process understanding. Recently, machine learning approaches trained on observational data have shown great potential in crop yield predictions. However, these models have not demonstrated improved performance over classical GGCMs and are not suitable for simulating crop yields under changing climate conditions due to problems in generalizing outside their training distributions. Here we introduce NeuralCrop, a hybrid GGCM that combines the strengths of an advanced process-based GGCM, resolving important processes explicitly, with data-driven machine learning components. The model is first trained to emulate a competitive GGCM before it is fine-tuned on observational data. We show that NeuralCrop outperforms state-of-the-art GGCMs across site-level and large-scale cropping regions. Across moisture conditions, NeuralCrop reproduces the interannual yield anomalies in European wheat regions and the US Corn Belt more accurately during the period from 2000 to 2019 with particularly strong improvements under drought extremes. When generalizing to conditions unseen during training, NeuralCrop continues to make robust projections, while pure machine learning models exhibit substantial performance degradation. Our results show that our hybrid crop modelling approach offers overall improved crop modeling and more reliable yield projections under climate change and intensifying extreme weather conditions.",

        "summary": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL) aims to learn a policy that maximizes the expected return using a given static dataset of transitions. However, offline RL faces the distribution shift problem. The policy constraint offline RL method is proposed to solve the distribution shift problem. During the policy constraint offline RL training, it is important to ensure the difference between the learned policy and behavior policy within a given threshold. Thus, the learned policy heavily relies on the quality of the behavior policy. However, a problem exists in existing policy constraint methods: if the dataset contains many low-reward transitions, the learned will be contained with a suboptimal reference policy, leading to slow learning speed, low sample efficiency, and inferior performances. This paper shows that the sampling method in policy constraint offline RL that uses all the transitions in the dataset can be improved. A simple but efficient sample filtering method is proposed to improve the sample efficiency and the final performance. First, we evaluate the score of the transitions by average reward and average discounted reward of episodes in the dataset and extract the transition samples of high scores. Second, the high-score transition samples are used to train the offline RL algorithms. We verify the proposed method in a series of offline RL algorithms and benchmark tasks.

We extend the IDS framework to the discounted infinite-horizon setting by introducing a modified information measure and a tuning parameter to modulate the decision-making behavior. We examine two specific problem classes: symmetric bandits and the scenario involving one fair coin. In the symmetric case we show that IDS achieves bounded cumulative regret, whereas in the one-fair-coin scenario the IDS policy yields a regret that scales logarithmically with the horizon, in agreement with classical asymptotic lower bounds.

Anomaly detection in these non-grid environments is particularly difficult due to the absence of canonical reference points, the sparsity and irregularity of trajectories, and the fact that anomalies may manifest at multiple granularities. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark dataset for anomaly detection in the maritime domain, extending the Open Maritime Traffic Analysis Dataset (OMTAD) into a benchmark tailored for graph-based anomaly detection. Our dataset enables systematic evaluation across three different granularities: node-level, edge-level, and graph-level anomalies.

It is fundamentally defined as the difference between the relaxed total energy of the adsorbate-surface system and that of an appropriate reference state; therefore, the accuracy of relaxed-energy prediction directly determines the reliability of machine-learning-driven catalyst screening. E(3)-equivariant graph neural networks (GNNs) can natively operate on three-dimensional atomic coordinates under periodic boundary conditions and have demonstrated strong performance on such tasks. In contrast, language-model-based approaches, while enabling human-readable textual descriptions and reducing reliance on explicit graph -- thereby broadening applicability -- remain insufficient in both adsorption-configuration energy prediction accuracy and in distinguishing ``the same system with different configurations,'' even with graph-assisted pretraining in the style of GAP-CATBERTa. To this end, we propose QE-Catalytic, a multimodal framework that deeply couples a large language model (\\textbf{Q}wen) with an E(3)-equivariant graph Transformer (\\textbf{E}quiformer-V2), enabling unified support for adsorption-configuration property prediction and inverse design on complex catalytic surfaces. During prediction, QE-Catalytic jointly leverages three-dimensional structures and structured configuration text, and injects ``3D geometric information'' into the language channel via graph-text alignment, allowing it to function as a high-performance text-based predictor when precise coordinates are unavailable, while also autoregressively generating CIF files for target-energy-driven structure design and information completion. On OC20, QE-Catalytic reduces the MAE of relaxed adsorption energy from 0.713~eV to 0.486~eV, and consistently outperforms baseline models such as CatBERTa and GAP-CATBERTa across multiple evaluation protocols.",

In this work, we give the general form of an optimal policy for learning controllable dynamics in an unknown environment by exploring over a limited time horizon. This policy is simple to implement and efficient to compute, and allows an agent to ``learn by exploring\" as it maximizes its information gain in a greedy fashion by selecting controls from a constraint set that changes over time during exploration. We give a simple parameterization for the set of controls, and present an algorithm for finding an optimal policy. The reason for this policy is due to the existence of certain types of states that restrict control of the dynamics; such as transient states, absorbing states, and non-backtracking states. We show why the occurrence of these states makes a non-stationary policy essential for achieving optimal exploration. Six interesting examples of controllable dynamics are treated in detail. Policy optimality is demonstrated using counting arguments, comparing with suboptimal policies, and by making use of a sequential improvement property from dynamic programming.",

Advanced deep learning methodologies, particularly Transformer-based and MLP-based architectures, have achieved competitive predictive performance in cryptocurrency forecasting tasks. However, cryptocurrency data is inherently composed of long-term socio-economic trends and local high-frequency speculative oscillations. Existing deep learning-based 'black-box' models fail to effectively decouple these composite dynamics or provide the interpretability needed for trustworthy financial decision-making. To overcome these limitations, we propose DecoKAN, an interpretable forecasting framework that integrates multi-level Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) for decoupling and hierarchical signal decomposition with Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) mixers for transparent and interpretable nonlinear modeling. The DWT component decomposes complex cryptocurrency time series into distinct frequency components, enabling frequency-specific analysis, while KAN mixers provide intrinsically interpretable spline-based mappings within each decomposed subseries. Furthermore, interpretability is enhanced through a symbolic analysis pipeline involving sparsification, pruning, and symbolization, which produces concise analytical expressions offering symbolic representations of the learned patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DecoKAN achieves the lowest average Mean Squared Error on all tested real-world cryptocurrency datasets (BTC, ETH, XMR), consistently outperforming a comprehensive suite of competitive state-of-the-art baselines. These results validate DecoKAN's potential to bridge the gap between predictive accuracy and model transparency, advancing trustworthy decision support within complex cryptocurrency markets.",

        "summary": "Class imbalance is a common challenge in machine learning and data mining, often leading to suboptimal performance in classifiers. While deep learning excels in feature extraction, its performance still deteriorates under imbalanced data. In this work, we propose a novel activation function, named OGAB, designed to alleviate class imbalance in deep learning classifiers. OGAB incorporates orthogonality and group-aware bias learning to enhance feature distinguishability in imbalanced scenarios without explicitly requiring label information. Our key insight is that activation functions can be used to introduce strong inductive biases that can address complex data challenges beyond traditional non-linearity. Our work demonstrates that orthogonal transformations can preserve information about minority classes by maintaining feature independence, thereby preventing the dominance of majority classes in the embedding space. Further, the proposed group-aware bias mechanism automatically identifies data clusters and adjusts embeddings to enhance class separability without the need for explicit supervision. Unlike existing approaches that address class imbalance through preprocessing data modifications or post-processing corrections, our proposed approach tackles class imbalance during the training phase at the embedding learning level, enabling direct integration with the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our solution on both real-world and synthetic imbalanced datasets, showing consistent performance improvements over both traditional and learnable activation functions.",

While the standard Denoising Score Identity (DSI) relies on data samples, access to the target energy function enables an alternative formulation via the Target Score Identity (TSI). However, these estimators face a fundamental variance trade-off: DSI exhibits high variance in low-noise regimes, whereas TSI suffers from high variance at high noise levels. In this work, we reconcile these approaches by unifying both estimators within the principled framework of control variates. We introduce the Control Variate Score Identity (CVSI), deriving an optimal, time-dependent control coefficient that theoretically guarantees variance minimization across the entire noise spectrum. We demonstrate that CVSI serves as a robust, low-variance plug-in estimator that significantly enhances sample efficiency in both data-free sampler learning and inference-time diffusion sampling.",

Existing deep forecasting models typically supervise predictions using full-length temporal windows, which include substantial high-frequency noise and obscure long-term trends. Moreover, auxiliary variables containing rich domain-specific information are often underutilized, especially in few-shot settings. To address these challenges, we propose LoFT-LLM, a frequency-aware forecasting pipeline that integrates low-frequency learning with semantic calibration via a large language model (LLM). Firstly, a Patch Low-Frequency forecasting Module (PLFM) extracts stable low-frequency trends from localized spectral patches. Secondly, a residual learner then models high-frequency variations. Finally, a fine-tuned LLM refines the predictions by incorporating auxiliary context and domain knowledge through structured natural language prompts. Extensive experiments on financial and energy datasets demonstrate that LoFT-LLM significantly outperforms strong baselines under both full-data and few-shot regimes, delivering superior accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.",

        "summary": "Machine learning models used in financial decision systems operate in nonstationary economic environments, yet adversarial robustness is typically evaluated under static assumptions. This work introduces Conditional Adversarial Fragility, a regime dependent phenomenon in which adversarial vulnerability is systematically amplified during periods of macroeconomic stress. We propose a regime aware evaluation framework for time indexed tabular financial classification tasks that conditions robustness assessment on external indicators of economic stress. Using volatility based regime segmentation as a proxy for macroeconomic conditions, we evaluate model behavior across calm and stress periods while holding model architecture, attack methodology, and evaluation protocols constant. Baseline predictive performance remains comparable across regimes, indicating that economic stress alone does not induce inherent performance degradation. Under adversarial perturbations, however, models operating during stress regimes exhibit substantially greater degradation across predictive accuracy, operational decision thresholds, and risk sensitive outcomes. We further demonstrate that this amplification propagates to increased false negative rates, elevating the risk of missed high risk cases during adverse conditions. To complement numerical robustness metrics, we introduce an interpretive governance layer based on semantic auditing of model explanations using large language models. Together, these results demonstrate that adversarial robustness in financial machine learning is a regime dependent property and motivate stress aware approaches to model risk assessment in high stakes financial deployments.",

        "summary": "Seismology faces fundamental challenges in state forecasting and reconstruction (e.g., earthquake early warning and ground motion prediction) and managing the parametric variability of source locations, mechanisms, and Earth models (e.g., subsurface structure and topography effects). Addressing these with simulations is hindered by their massive scale, both in synthetic data volumes and numerical complexity, while real-data efforts are constrained by models that inadequately reflect the Earth's complexity and by sparse sensor measurements from the field. Recent machine learning (ML) efforts offer promise, but progress is obscured by a lack of proper characterization, fair reporting, and rigorous comparisons. To address this, we introduce a Common Task Framework (CTF) for ML for seismic wavefields, starting with three distinct wavefield datasets. Our CTF features a curated set of datasets at various scales (global, crustal, and local) and task-specific metrics spanning forecasting, reconstruction, and generalization under realistic constraints such as noise and limited data. Inspired by CTFs in fields like natural language processing, this framework provides a structured and rigorous foundation for head-to-head algorithm evaluation. We illustrate the evaluation procedure with scores reported for two of the datasets, showcasing the performance of various methods and foundation models for reconstructing seismic wavefields from both simulated and real-world sensor measurements. The CTF scores reveal the strengths, limitations, and suitability for specific problem classes.

        "summary": "LLM deployment in critical domains is currently impeded by persistent hallucinations--generating plausible but factually incorrect assertions. While scaling laws drove significant improvements in general capabilities, theoretical frameworks suggest hallucination is not merely stochastic error but a predictable statistical consequence of training objectives prioritizing mimicking data distribution over epistemic honesty. Standard RLVR paradigms, utilizing binary reward signals, inadvertently incentivize models as good test-takers rather than honest communicators, encouraging guessing whenever correctness probability exceeds zero. This paper presents an exhaustive investigation into behavioral calibration, which incentivizes models to stochastically admit uncertainty by abstaining when not confident, aligning model behavior with accuracy. Synthesizing recent advances, we propose and evaluate training interventions optimizing strictly proper scoring rules for models to output a calibrated probability of correctness. Our methods enable models to either abstain from producing a complete response or flag individual claims where uncertainty remains. Utilizing Qwen3-4B-Instruct, empirical analysis reveals behavior-calibrated reinforcement learning allows smaller models to surpass frontier models in uncertainty quantification--a transferable meta-skill decouplable from raw predictive accuracy. Trained on math reasoning tasks, our model's log-scale Accuracy-to-Hallucination Ratio gain (0.806) exceeds GPT-5's (0.207) in a challenging in-domain evaluation (BeyondAIME). Moreover, in cross-domain factual QA (SimpleQA), our 4B LLM achieves zero-shot calibration error on par with frontier models including Grok-4 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, even though its factual accuracy is much lower.",

Current non-ergodic GMMs rely on Gaussian Process (GP) methods with prescribed correlation functions and thus have computational limitations for large-scale predictions. This study proposes a deep-learning approach called Conditional Generative Modeling for Fourier Amplitude Spectra (CGM-FAS) as an alternative to GP-based methods for modeling non-ergodic path effects in Fourier Amplitude Spectra (FAS). CGM-FAS uses a Conditional Variational Autoencoder architecture to learn spatial patterns and interfrequency correlation directly from data by using geographical coordinates of earthquakes and stations as conditional variables. Using San Francisco Bay Area earthquake data, we compare CGM-FAS against a recent GP-based GMM for the region and demonstrate consistent predictions of non-ergodic path effects. Additionally, CGM-FAS offers advantages compared to GP-based approaches in learning spatial patterns without prescribed correlation functions, capturing interfrequency correlations, and enabling rapid predictions, generating maps for 10,000 sites across 1,000 frequencies within 10 seconds using a few GB of memory. CGM-FAS hyperparameters can be tuned to ensure generated path effects exhibit variability consistent with the GP-based empirical GMM. This work demonstrates a promising direction for efficient non-ergodic ground-motion prediction across multiple frequencies and large spatial domains.",

        "summary": "Recent developments in large language models have shown advantages in reallocating a notable share of computational resource from training time to inference time. However, the principles behind inference time scaling are not well understood. In this paper, we introduce an analytically tractable model of inference-time scaling: Bayesian linear regression with a reward-weighted sampler, where the reward is determined from a linear model, modeling LLM-as-a-judge scenario. We study this problem in the high-dimensional regime, where the deterministic equivalents dictate a closed-form expression for the posterior predictive mean and variance. We analyze the generalization error when training data are sampled from a teacher model. We draw $k$ inference-time samples and select via softmax at a temperature applied to a quadratic reward. When the reward is not too different from the teacher, the generalization error decreases monotonically with increasing inference time samples $k$. However, the specific reward that optimizes inference-time selection generally differs from the teacher. In contrast, substantial reward misspecification induces a finite optimal $k$ beyond which more sampling can increase the generalization error. For fixed $k$, there exists an optimal sampling temperature. We experimentally verify these facts in large language model inference with an additional large language model as a judge. In the \"best-of-$k$\" limit with the teacher as reward, we theoretically show that the generalization error decays as $Θ(1/k^2)$ and determine the leading coefficient via extreme value theory. These formulas delineate domains where scaling inference-time computation is provably preferable to collecting more data. Finally, we demonstrate that when task difficulty increases, the previously mentioned advantage of inference-time compute degrades.",

While prompt-based methods excel in few-shot scenarios, their effectiveness often plateaus as more data becomes available. Conversely, fine-tuning scales well with data but may underperform when training examples are scarce. We investigate a unified approach that bridges these two paradigms by incorporating in-context learning directly into the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we fine-tune the model on task-specific data augmented with in-context examples, mimicking the structure of k-shot prompts. This approach, while requiring per-task fine-tuning, combines the sample efficiency of in-context learning with the performance gains of fine-tuning, leading to a method that consistently matches and often significantly exceeds both these baselines. To perform hyperparameter selection in the low-data regime, we propose to use prequential evaluation, which eliminates the need for expensive cross-validation and leverages all available data for training while simultaneously providing a robust validation signal. We conduct an extensive empirical study to determine which adaptation paradigm - fine-tuning, in-context learning, or our proposed unified approach offers the best predictive performance on a concrete data downstream-tasks.",

For example, using a proper orthogonal decomposition produces a ROM that is a small linear combination of fixed features and weights, but that is constrained to the given process it models. In this work, we explore a new type of ROM that is not constrained to fixed weights, based on neural Galerkin-Projections, which is an initial value problem that encodes the physics of the governing PDEs, calibrated via neural networks to accurately model the trajectory of these weights. Then using a statistical hierarchical pooling technique to learn a distribution on the initial values of the temporal weights, we can create new, statistically interpretable and physically justified weights that are generalized to many similar problems. When recombined with the spatial features, we form a complete physics surrogate, called a randPROM, for generating simulations that are consistent in distribution to a neighborhood of initial conditions close to those used to construct the ROM. We apply the randPROM technique to the study of tsunamis, which are unpredictable, catastrophic, and highly-detailed non-linear problems, modeling both a synthetic case of tsunamis near Fiji and the real-world Tohoku 2011 disaster. We demonstrate that randPROMs may enable us to significantly reduce the number of simulations needed to generate a statistically calibrated and physically defensible prediction model for arrival time and height of tsunami waves.",

We propose Mixture-of-Experts for Adaptive Semantic Specialization (MASS), a semanticaware MoE framework for adaptive expert expansion and dynamic routing. MASS introduces two key advancements: (i) a gradient-based semantic drift detector that prompts targeted expert expansion when the existing expert pool lacks capacity to capture the full semantic diversity of the data, and (ii) an integration of adaptive routing strategy that dynamically adjusts expert usage based on token-level routing confidence mass. We first demonstrate that MASS reliably converges to the point of optimal balance between cost-performance trade-off with notably improved sematic specialization in a highly controlled synthetic setup. Further empirical results on real-world datasets across language and vision domains show that MASS consistently outperforms a range of strong MoE baselines, demonstrating its domain robustness and enhanced expert specialization.",

Chamfer Distance is efficient but permits many-to-one correspondences, while Earth Mover Distance better reflects one-to-one transport at high computational cost. APML approximates transport with differentiable Sinkhorn iterations and an analytically derived temperature, but its dense formulation scales quadratically in memory. We present CUDA-APML, a sparse GPU implementation that thresholds negligible assignments and runs adaptive softmax, bidirectional symmetrization, and Sinkhorn normalization directly in COO form. This yields near-linear memory scaling and preserves gradients on the stored support, while pairwise distance evaluation remains quadratic in the current implementation. On ShapeNet and MM-Fi, CUDA-APML matches dense APML within a small tolerance while reducing peak GPU memory by 99.9%. Code available at: https://github.com/Multimodal-Sensing-Lab/apml",

In this work, we propose a lightweight yet effective multi-stage optimization pipeline designed to compress and accelerate Vision Transformers (ViTs) for deployment in resource-constrained environments. Our methodology combines activation profiling, memory-aware pruning, selective mixed-precision execution, and activation-aware quantization (AWQ) to reduce the model's memory footprint without requiring costly retraining or task-specific fine-tuning. Starting from a ViT-Huge backbone with 632 million parameters, we first identify low-importance channels using activation statistics collected via forward hooks, followed by structured pruning to shrink the MLP layers under a target memory budget. We further apply FP16 conversion to selected components and leverage AWQ to quantize the remaining model weights and activations to INT8 with minimal accuracy degradation. Our experiments on CIFAR-10 demonstrate that the fully optimized model achieves a 76% reduction in peak memory usage and over 6x lower latency, while retaining or even improving accuracy compared to the original FP32 baseline. This framework offers a practical path toward efficient transformer inference on edge platforms, and opens future avenues for integrating dynamic sparsity and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures to further scale performance across diverse tasks.",

        "summary": "Voice assistants utilize Keyword Spotting (KWS) to enable efficient, privacy-friendly activation. However, realizing accurate KWS models on ultra-low-power TinyML devices (often with less than $<2$ MB of flash memory) necessitates a delicate balance between accuracy with strict resource constraints. Multi-objective Bayesian Optimization (MOBO) is an ideal candidate for managing such a trade-off but is highly initialization-dependent, especially under the budgeted black-box setting. Existing methods typically fall back to naive, ad-hoc sampling routines (e.g., Latin Hypercube Sampling (LHS), Sobol sequences, or Random search) that are adapted to neither the Pareto front nor undergo rigorous statistical comparison. To address this, we propose Objective-Aware Surrogate Initialization (OASI), a novel initialization strategy that leverages Multi-Objective Simulated Annealing (MOSA) to generate a seed Pareto set of high-performing and diverse configurations that explicitly balance accuracy and model size. Evaluated in a TinyML KWS setting, OASI outperforms LHS, Sobol, and Random initialization, achieving the highest hypervolume (0.0627) and the lowest generational distance (0.0) across multiple runs, with only a modest increase in computation time (1934 s vs. $\\sim$1500 s). A non-parametric statistical analysis using the Kruskal-Wallis test ($H = 5.40$, $p = 0.144$, $η^2 = 0.0007$) and Dunn's post-hoc test confirms OASI's superior consistency despite the non-significant overall difference with respect to the $α=0.05$ threshold.",

We propose OpComm, a forecasting and decision-support framework that combines supervised learning with reinforcement learning-based buffer control and a generative AI-driven communication module. A LightGBM regression model generates station-level demand forecasts, which serve as context for a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that selects buffer levels from a discrete action set. The reward function penalizes under-buffering more heavily than over-buffering, reflecting real-world trade-offs between unmet demand risks and resource inefficiency. Station outcomes are fed back through a Monte Carlo update mechanism, enabling continual policy adaptation. To enhance interpretability, a generative AI layer produces executive-level summaries and scenario analyses grounded in SHAP-based feature attributions. Across 400+ stations, OpComm reduced Weighted Absolute Percentage Error (WAPE) by 21.65% compared to manual forecasts, while lowering under-buffering incidents and improving transparency for decision-makers. This work shows how contextual reinforcement learning, coupled with predictive modeling, can address operational forecasting challenges and bridge statistical rigor with practical decision-making in high-stakes logistics environments.",

Prior diffusion-based approaches either embed conditions into the diffusion model, requiring retraining for each attribute and hindering real-time applicability, or use classifier-based guidance post-training, which does not account for topology scale and practical constraints. In this paper, we show from a discrete perspective that gradients from a pre-trained graph-level classifier can be incorporated into the discrete reverse diffusion posterior to steer generation toward specified structural properties. Based on this insight, we propose Classifier-guided Conditional Topology Generation with Persistent Homology (CoPHo), which builds a persistent homology filtration over intermediate graphs and interprets features as guidance signals that steer generation toward the desired properties at each denoising step. Experiments on four generic/network datasets demonstrate that CoPHo outperforms existing methods at matching target metrics, and we further validate its transferability on the QM9 molecular dataset.",

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in predicting outcomes from structured medical data, their predictions may exhibit demographic biases related to sex, age, and race, limiting their trustworthy use in clinical practice. Existing debiasing methods often reduce predictive performance, making it difficult to jointly optimize fairness and accuracy. In this study, we systematically examine bias in LLM-based ICU mortality prediction and propose a training-free, clinically adaptive prompting framework to simultaneously improve fairness and performance. We first develop a multi-dimensional bias assessment scheme for comprehensive model diagnosis. Building on this analysis, we introduce CAse Prompting (CAP), a novel prompting framework that integrates conventional debiasing prompts with case-based reasoning. CAP guides the model to learn from similar historical misprediction cases and their correct outcomes, enabling correction of biased reasoning patterns. Experiments on the MIMIC-IV dataset show that CAP substantially improves both predictive accuracy and fairness. CAP increases AUROC from 0.806 to 0.873 and AUPRC from 0.497 to 0.694, while reducing sex- and race-related disparities by over 90%. Feature reliance analysis further indicates highly consistent attention patterns across demographic groups, with similarity scores exceeding 0.98. These results demonstrate that LLMs exhibit measurable bias in ICU mortality prediction, and that a carefully designed prompting framework can effectively co-optimize fairness and performance without retraining, offering a transferable paradigm for equitable clinical decision support.",

Despite its promise, the evolving network depth comes at the cost of degraded hardware efficiency. In contrast to deep networks, shallow networks can deliver superior hardware efficiency but often suffer from inferior accuracy. To address this dilemma, we propose Double-Win NAS, a novel deep-to-shallow transformable neural architecture search (NAS) paradigm tailored for resource-constrained intelligent embedded systems. Specifically, Double-Win NAS strives to automatically explore deep networks to first win strong accuracy, which are then equivalently transformed into their shallow counterparts to further win strong hardware efficiency. In addition to search, we also propose two enhanced training techniques, including hybrid transformable training towards better training accuracy and arbitrary-resolution elastic training towards enabling natural network elasticity across arbitrary input resolutions. Extensive experimental results on two popular intelligent embedded systems (i.e., NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier and NVIDIA Jetson Nano) and two representative large-scale datasets (i.e., ImageNet and ImageNet-100) clearly demonstrate the superiority of Double-Win NAS over previous state-of-the-art NAS approaches.",

        "summary": "Backdoor attacks pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of deep learning models. To mitigate such attacks, one promising approach is to learn to extract features from the target model and use these features for backdoor detection. However, we discover that existing learning-based neural backdoor detection methods do not generalize well to new architectures not seen during the learning phase. In this paper, we analyze the root cause of this issue and propose a novel black-box neural backdoor detection method called ArcGen. Our method aims to obtain architecture-invariant model features, i.e., aligned features, for effective backdoor detection. Specifically, in contrast to existing methods directly using model outputs as model features, we introduce an additional alignment layer in the feature extraction function to further process these features. This reduces the direct influence of architecture information on the features. Then, we design two alignment losses to train the feature extraction function. These losses explicitly require that features from models with similar backdoor behaviors but different architectures are aligned at both the distribution and sample levels. With these techniques, our method demonstrates up to 42.5% improvements in detection performance (e.g., AUC) on unseen model architectures. This is based on a large-scale evaluation involving 16,896 models trained on diverse datasets, subjected to various backdoor attacks, and utilizing different model architectures.

This perspective is limiting in practice, as failures in chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning are frequently structured; solutions may appear convincing while containing subtle logical, algebraic, or numerical flaws. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) variants that rely on large reward models or LLM-as-a-judge signals are often expensive, difficult to scale, and unstable to iterate. We propose a lightweight and pragmatic post-training pipeline that targets such structured errors under realistic compute budgets. Starting from supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on MetaMathQA-style CoT data, we introduce a compact MathVerifier that decomposes a candidate solution into a six-dimensional error profile and aggregates it into interpretable wrongness and absurdity scores. These verifier signals serve two roles: (i) mining hard negatives that are near-correct yet structurally flawed, and (ii) defining per-sample importance weights that emphasize the most informative preference pairs. We integrate both into an offline Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) objective via a verifier-guided weighted formulation. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter Qwen2.5 model show that verifier-guided, weighted DPO yields more targeted improvements than vanilla SFT and unweighted DPO, particularly on problems where solutions are numerically close to correct but logically inconsistent, while avoiding the overhead of training large reward models or relying on external judges.",

The field of technology forecasting has long relied on quantitative trend extrapolation techniques, such as growth curves (e.g., Moore's law) and time series models, to project technological progress. To assess the current state of these methods, we conducted an updated systematic literature review (SLR) that incorporates recent advances. This review highlights a growing trend toward machine learning-based hybrid models. Motivated by this review, we developed a forecasting model that combines long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks with an augmentation of Moore's law to predict spacecraft lifetimes. Operational lifetime is an important engineering characteristic of spacecraft and a potential proxy for technological progress in space exploration. Lifetimes were modeled as depending on launch date and additional predictors. Our modeling analysis introduces a novel advance in the recently introduced Start Time End Time Integration (STETI) approach. STETI addresses a critical right censoring problem known to bias lifetime analyses: the more recent the launch dates, the shorter the lifetimes of the spacecraft that have failed and can thus contribute lifetime data. Longer-lived spacecraft are still operating and therefore do not contribute data. This systematically distorts putative lifetime versus launch date curves by biasing lifetime estimates for recent launch dates downward. STETI mitigates this distortion by interconverting between expressing lifetimes as functions of launch time and modeling them as functions of failure time. The results provide insights relevant to space mission planning and policy decision-making.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved strong results, but deploying visual policies on resource-constrained edge devices remains challenging due to computational cost and communication latency. Many deployments therefore offload policy inference to a remote server, incurring network round trips and requiring transmission of high-dimensional observations. We introduce a split-policy architecture in which a small on-device encoder, implemented as OpenGL fragment-shader passes for broad embedded GPU support, transforms each observation into a compact feature tensor that is transmitted to a remote policy head. In RL, this communication overhead manifests as closed-loop decision latency rather than only per-request inference latency. The proposed approach reduces transmitted data, lowers decision latency in bandwidth-limited settings, and reduces server-side compute per request, whilst achieving broadly comparable learning performance by final return (mean over the final 100 episodes) in single-run benchmarks, with modest trade-offs in mean return. We evaluate across an NVIDIA Jetson Nano, a Raspberry Pi 4B, and a Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W, reporting learning results, on-device execution behaviour under sustained load, and end-to-end decision latency and scalability measurements under bandwidth shaping. Code for training, deployment, and measurement is released as open source.",

        "summary": "Recent years have witnessed significant progress in the development of machine learning models across a wide range of fields, fueled by increased computational resources, large-scale datasets, and the rise of deep learning architectures. From malware detection to enabling autonomous navigation, modern machine learning systems have demonstrated remarkable capabilities. However, as these models are deployed in ever-changing real-world scenarios, their ability to remain reliable and adaptive over time becomes increasingly important. For example, in the real world, new malware families are continuously developed, whereas autonomous driving cars are employed in many different cities and weather conditions. Models trained in fixed settings can not respond effectively to novel conditions encountered post-deployment. In fact, most machine learning models are still developed under the assumption that training and test data are independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.), i.e., sampled from the same underlying (unknown) distribution. While this assumption simplifies model development and evaluation, it does not hold in many real-world applications, where data changes over time and unexpected inputs frequently occur. Retraining models from scratch whenever new data appears is computationally expensive, time-consuming, and impractical in resource-constrained environments. These limitations underscore the need for Continual Learning (CL), which enables models to incrementally learn from evolving data streams without forgetting past knowledge, and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection, which allows systems to identify and respond to novel or anomalous inputs. Jointly addressing both challenges is critical to developing robust, efficient, and adaptive AI systems.",

Formally, the construction is a set- and measure-theoretic geometry: signals are represented as atomic measures on a signed state space, and similarity is given by a generalized Jaccard overlap of these measures. Each signal is embedded into a nonnegative multistate representation, using positive/negative splits for real signals, Cartesian and polar decompositions for complex signals, and user-defined state partitions for refined regime analysis. Applying the Tanimoto construction to these embeddings yields a family of $[0,1]$ distances that satisfy the triangle inequality and define positive-semidefinite kernels usable directly in kernel methods and graph-based learning. Beyond pairwise distances, we develop coalition analysis via Möbius inversion, which decomposes signal magnitude into nonnegative, additive contributions with exact budget closure across coalitions of signals. Normalizing the same embeddings produces probability measures on coordinate -- state configurations, so that the distance becomes a monotone transform of total variation and admits a regime -- intensity decomposition. The resulting construction yields a single, mechanistically interpretable distance that simultaneously provides bounded metric structure, positive-semidefinite kernels, probabilistic semantics, and transparent budget accounting within one sign-aware framework, supporting correlograms, feature engineering, similarity graphs, and other analytical tools in scientific and financial applications.",

Since fine-tuned weights differ from their base model by relatively small structured residuals, a natural approach is to represent them as compressed deltas. We propose a simple 1-bit delta scheme that stores only the sign of the weight difference together with lightweight per-axis (row/column) FP16 scaling factors, learned from a small calibration set. This design preserves the compactness of 1-bit deltas while more accurately capturing variation across weight dimensions, leading to improved reconstruction quality over scalar alternatives. From a systems perspective, a streamlined loader that transfers packed deltas in a single operation per module reduces cold-start latency and storage overhead, with artifacts several times smaller than a full FP16 checkpoint. The method is drop-in, requires minimal calibration data, and maintains inference efficiency by avoiding dense reconstruction.

These include: (i) healthcare diagnostics, (ii) socioeconomic and financial modelling, and (iii) cybersecurity and network traffic analysis. These use cases reveal how SDB can address diverse data fidelity assessment challenges, varying from mixed-type clinical variables to high-cardinality categorical attributes and high-dimensional telemetry signals, while at the same time offering a consistent, transparent, and reproducible benchmarking across heterogeneous domains.",

The objective was to develop a multimodal deep learning model, using structured and unstructured clinical data, to predict in-hospital mortality risk among critically ill patients after their initial 24 hour intensive care unit (ICU) admission. We used data from MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, and HiRID. A multimodal model was developed on the MIMIC datasets, featuring time series components occurring within the first 24 hours of ICU admission and predicting risk of subsequent inpatient mortality. Inputs included time-invariant variables, time-variant variables, clinical notes, and chest X-ray images. External validation occurred in a temporally separated MIMIC population, HiRID, and eICU datasets. A total of 203,434 ICU admissions from more than 200 hospitals between 2001 to 2022 were included, in which mortality rate ranged from 5.2% to 7.9% across the four datasets. The model integrating structured data points had AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier scores of 0.92, 0.53, and 0.19, respectively. We externally validated the model on eight different institutions within the eICU dataset, demonstrating AUROCs ranging from 0.84-0.92. When including only patients with available clinical notes and imaging data, inclusion of notes and imaging into the model, the AUROC, AUPRC, and Brier score improved from 0.87 to 0.89, 0.43 to 0.48, and 0.37 to 0.17, respectively.

Conversely, unsupervised methods eliminate labeling needs but often deliver suboptimal performance. This paper presents a comprehensive investigation across the supervision spectrum for wearable-based HAR, with particular focus on novel approaches that minimize labeling requirements while maintaining competitive accuracy. We develop and empirically compare: (1) traditional fully supervised learning, (2) basic unsupervised learning, (3) a weakly supervised learning approach with constraints, (4) a multi-task learning approach with knowledge sharing, (5) a self-supervised approach based on domain expertise, and (6) a novel weakly self-supervised learning framework that leverages domain knowledge and minimal labeled data. Experiments across benchmark datasets demonstrate that: (i) our weakly supervised methods achieve performance comparable to fully supervised approaches while significantly reducing supervision requirements; (ii) the proposed multi-task framework enhances performance through knowledge sharing between related tasks; (iii) our weakly self-supervised approach demonstrates remarkable efficiency with just 10\\% of labeled data. These results not only highlight the complementary strengths of different learning paradigms, offering insights into tailoring HAR solutions based on the availability of labeled data, but also establish that our novel weakly self-supervised framework offers a promising solution for practical HAR applications where labeled data are limited.",

Inspired by FedPIDAvg, we define a round-wise task for FedPOD to enhance training efficiency. FedPIDAvg achieved performance improvement by incorporating the training loss reduction for prediction entropy as weights using differential terms. Furthermore, by modeling data distribution with a Poisson distribution and using a PID controller, it reduced communication costs even in skewed data distribution. However, excluding participants classified as outliers based on the Poisson distribution can limit data utilization. Additionally, PID controller requires the same participants to be maintained throughout the federated learning process as it uses previous rounds' learning information in the current round. In our approach, FedPOD addresses these issues by including participants excluded as outliers, eliminating dependency on previous rounds' learning information, and applying a method for calculating validation loss at each round. In this challenge, FedPOD presents comparable performance to FedPIDAvg in metrics of Dice score, 0.78, 0.71 and 0.72 for WT, ET and TC in average, and projected convergence score, 0.74 in average. Furthermore, the concept of FedPOD draws inspiration from Kubernetes' smallest computing unit, POD, designed to be compatible with Kubernetes auto-scaling. Extending round-wise tasks of FedPOD to POD units allows flexible design by applying scale-out similar to Kubernetes' auto-scaling.

Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13.

Our main result is the significantly improved sample complexity for learning such low-degree polynomials. We show that, for any regression risk $\\eps \\in (0,1)$, a carefully designed two-layer NN with channel attention and finite width of $m \\ge Θ({n^4 \\log (2n/δ)}/{d^{2\\ell_0}})$ trained by the vanilla gradient descent (GD) requires the lowest sample complexity of $n \\asymp Θ(d^{\\ell_0}/\\eps)$ with probability $1-δ$ for every $δ\\in (0,1)$, in contrast with the representative sample complexity $Θ\\pth{d^{\\ell_0} \\max\\set{\\eps^{-2},\\log d}}$, where $n$ is the training daata size. Moreover, such sample complexity is not improvable since the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the order $Θ(d^{\\ell_0}/{n})$ with probability at least $1-δ$. On the other hand, the minimax optimal rate for the regression risk with a kernel of rank $Θ(d^{\\ell_0})$ is $Θ(d^{\\ell_0}/{n})$, so that the rate of the nonparametric regression risk of the network trained by GD is minimax optimal. The training of the two-layer NN with channel attention consists of two stages. In Stage 1, a provable learnable channel selection algorithm identifies the ground-truth channel number $\\ell_0$ from the initial $L \\ge \\ell_0$ channels in the first-layer activation, with high probability. This learnable selection is achieved by an efficient one-step GD update on both layers, enabling feature learning for low-degree polynomial targets. In Stage 2, the second layer is trained by standard GD using the activation function with the selected channels.",

        "summary": "Goal-oriented communications offer an attractive alternative to the Shannon-based communication paradigm, where the data is never reconstructed at the Receiver (RX) side. Rather, focusing on the case of edge inference, the Transmitter (TX) and the RX cooperate to exchange features of the input data that will be used to predict an unseen attribute of them, leveraging information from collected data sets. This chapter demonstrates that the wireless channel can be used to perform computations over the data, when equipped with programmable metasurfaces. The end-to-end system of the TX, RX, and MS-based channel is treated as a single deep neural network which is trained through backpropagation to perform inference on unseen data. Using Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), it is shown that this Metasurfaces-Integrated Neural Network (MINN) can achieve performance comparable to fully digital neural networks under various system parameters and data sets. By offloading computations onto the channel itself, important benefits may be achieved in terms of energy consumption, arising from reduced computations at the transceivers and smaller transmission power required for successful inference.",

        "summary": "This study proposes Riesz representer estimation methods based on score matching. The Riesz representer is a key component in debiased machine learning for constructing $\\sqrt{n}$-consistent and efficient estimators in causal inference and structural parameter estimation. To estimate the Riesz representer, direct approaches have garnered attention, such as Riesz regression and the covariate balancing propensity score. These approaches can also be interpreted as variants of direct density ratio estimation (DRE) in several applications such as average treatment effect estimation. In DRE, it is well known that flexible models can easily overfit the observed data due to the estimand and the form of the loss function. To address this issue, recent work has proposed modeling the density ratio as a product of multiple intermediate density ratios and estimating it using score-matching techniques, which are often used in the diffusion model literature. We extend score-matching-based DRE methods to Riesz representer estimation. Our proposed method not only mitigates overfitting but also provides insights for causal inference by bridging marginal effects and average policy effects through time score functions.",

While these systems provide numerous benefits, their misuse raises safety and security concerns, making effective detection mechanisms essential. Acoustic sensing offers a low-cost and non-intrusive alternative to vision or radar-based detection, as drone propellers generate distinctive sound patterns. This study introduces AUDRON (AUdio-based Drone Recognition Network), a hybrid deep learning framework for drone sound detection, employing a combination of Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCC), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) spectrograms processed with convolutional neural networks (CNNs), recurrent layers for temporal modeling, and autoencoder-based representations. Feature-level fusion integrates complementary information before classification. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that AUDRON effectively differentiates drone acoustic signatures from background noise, achieving high accuracy while maintaining generalizability across varying conditions. AUDRON achieves 98.51 percent and 97.11 percent accuracy in binary and multiclass classification. The results highlight the advantage of combining multiple feature representations with deep learning for reliable acoustic drone detection, suggesting the framework's potential for deployment in security and surveillance applications where visual or radar sensing may be limited.",

        "summary": "Statistical inference in contextual bandits is complicated by the adaptive, non-i.i.d. nature of the data. A growing body of work has shown that classical least-squares inference may fail under adaptive sampling, and that constructing valid confidence intervals for linear functionals of the model parameter typically requires paying an unavoidable inflation of order $\\sqrt{d \\log T}$. This phenomenon -- often referred to as the price of adaptivity -- highlights the inherent difficulty of reliable inference under general contextual bandit policies. A key structural property that circumvents this limitation is the \\emph{stability} condition of Lai and Wei, which requires the empirical feature covariance to concentrate around a deterministic limit. When stability holds, the ordinary least-squares estimator satisfies a central limit theorem, and classical Wald-type confidence intervals -- designed for i.i.d. data -- become asymptotically valid even under adaptation, \\emph{without} incurring the $\\sqrt{d \\log T}$ price of adaptivity. In this paper, we propose and analyze a penalized EXP4 algorithm for linear contextual bandits. Our first main result shows that this procedure satisfies the Lai--Wei stability condition and therefore admits valid Wald-type confidence intervals for linear functionals. Our second result establishes that the same algorithm achieves regret guarantees that are minimax optimal up to logarithmic factors, demonstrating that stability and statistical efficiency can coexist within a single contextual bandit method. Finally, we complement our theory with simulations illustrating the empirical normality of the resulting estimators and the sharpness of the corresponding confidence intervals.",

However, the black-box nature of LLMs remains a major barrier to their adoption in high-stakes and safety-critical domains, where explainability and transparency are vital for trust, accountability, and effective human supervision. Despite increasing interest in explainable AI for software engineering, existing methods lack domain-specific explanations aligned with how practitioners reason about SE artifacts. To address this gap, we introduce FeatureSHAP, the first fully automated, model-agnostic explainability framework tailored to software engineering tasks. Based on Shapley values, FeatureSHAP attributes model outputs to high-level input features through systematic input perturbation and task-specific similarity comparisons, while remaining compatible with both open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluate FeatureSHAP on two bi-modal SE tasks: code generation and code summarization. The results show that FeatureSHAP assigns less importance to irrelevant input features and produces explanations with higher fidelity than baseline methods. A practitioner survey involving 37 participants shows that FeatureSHAP helps practitioners better interpret model outputs and make more informed decisions. Collectively, FeatureSHAP represents a meaningful step toward practical explainable AI in software engineering. FeatureSHAP is available at https://github.com/deviserlab/FeatureSHAP.",

CoxPH assumes constant hazard ratios, often failing to capture real-world dynamics, while traditional AFT models are limited by rigid distributional assumptions. Although deep learning models like DeepAFT address these constraints by improving predictive accuracy and handling censoring, they inherit the significant challenge of black-box interpretability. The recent introduction of CoxKAN demonstrated the successful integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), a novel architecture that yields highly accurate and interpretable symbolic representations, within the CoxPH framework. Motivated by the interpretability gains of CoxKAN, we introduce KAN-AFT (Kolmogorov Arnold Network-based AFT), the first framework to apply KANs to the AFT model. KAN-AFT effectively models complex nonlinear relationships within the AFT framework. Our primary contributions include: (i) a principled AFT-KAN formulation, (ii) robust optimization strategies for right-censored observations (e.g., Buckley-James and IPCW), and (iii) an interpretability pipeline that converts the learned spline functions into closed-form symbolic equations for survival time. Empirical results on multiple datasets confirm that KAN-AFT achieves performance comparable to or better than DeepAFT, while uniquely providing transparent, symbolic models of the survival process.",

        "summary": "Many engineering tasks require solving families of nonlinear constrained optimization problems, parametrized in setting-specific variables. This is computationally demanding, particularly, if solutions have to be computed across strongly varying parameter values, e.g., in real-time control or for model-based design. Thus, we propose to learn the mapping from parameters to the primal optimal solutions and to their corresponding duals using neural networks, giving a dense estimation in contrast to gridded approaches. Our approach, Optimality-informed Neural Networks (OptINNs), combines (i) a KKT-residual loss that penalizes violations of the first-order optimality conditions under standard constraint qualifications assumptions, and (ii) problem-specific output activations that enforce simple inequality constraints (e.g., box-type/positivity) by construction. This design reduces data requirements, allows the prediction of dual variables, and improves feasibility and closeness to optimality compared to penalty-only training. Taking quadratic penalties as a baseline, since this approach has been previously proposed for the considered problem class in literature, our method simplifies hyperparameter tuning and attains tighter adherence to optimality conditions. We evaluate OptINNs on different nonlinear optimization problems ranging from low to high dimensions. On small problems, OptINNs match a quadratic-penalty baseline in primal accuracy while additionally predicting dual variables with low error. On larger problems, OptINNs achieve lower constraint violations and lower primal error compared to neural networks based on the quadratic-penalty method. These results suggest that embedding feasibility and optimality into the network architecture and loss can make learning-based surrogates more accurate, feasible, and data-efficient for parametric optimization.",

        "summary": "By integrating language understanding with perceptual modalities such as images, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) constitute a critical substrate for modern AI systems, particularly intelligent agents operating in open and interactive environments. However, their increasing accessibility also raises heightened risks of misuse, such as generating harmful or unsafe content. To mitigate these risks, alignment techniques are commonly applied to align model behavior with human values. Despite these efforts, recent studies have shown that jailbreak attacks can circumvent alignment and elicit unsafe outputs. Currently, most existing jailbreak methods are tailored for open-source models and exhibit limited effectiveness against commercial MLLM-integrated systems, which often employ additional filters. These filters can detect and prevent malicious input and output content, significantly reducing jailbreak threats. In this paper, we reveal that the success of these safety filters heavily relies on a critical assumption that malicious content must be explicitly visible in either the input or the output. This assumption, while often valid for traditional LLM-integrated systems, breaks down in MLLM-integrated systems, where attackers can leverage multiple modalities to conceal adversarial intent, leading to a false sense of security in existing MLLM-integrated systems. To challenge this assumption, we propose Odysseus, a novel jailbreak paradigm that introduces dual steganography to covertly embed malicious queries and responses into benign-looking images. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Odysseus successfully jailbreaks several pioneering and realistic MLLM-integrated systems, achieving up to 99% attack success rate. It exposes a fundamental blind spot in existing defenses, and calls for rethinking cross-modal security in MLLM-integrated systems.",

        "summary": "Goodness-of-fit (GoF) tests are fundamental for assessing model adequacy. Score-based tests are appealing because they require fitting the model only once under the null. However, extending them to powerful nonparametric alternatives is difficult due to the lack of suitable score functions. Through a class of exponentially tilted models, we show that the resulting score-based GoF tests are equivalent to the tests based on integral probability metrics (IPMs) indexed by a function class. When the class is rich, the test is universally consistent. This simple yet insightful perspective enables reinterpretation of classical distance-based testing procedures-including those based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance, Wasserstein-1 distance, and maximum mean discrepancy-as arising from score-based constructions. Building on this insight, we propose a new nonparametric score-based GoF test through a special class of IPM induced by kernelized Stein's function class, called semiparametric kernelized Stein discrepancy (SKSD) test. Compared with other nonparametric score-based tests, the SKSD test is computationally efficient and accommodates general nuisance-parameter estimators, supported by a generic parametric bootstrap procedure. The SKSD test is universally consistent and attains Pitman efficiency. Moreover, SKSD test provides simple GoF tests for models with intractable likelihoods but tractable scores with the help of Stein's identity and we use two popular models, kernel exponential family and conditional Gaussian models, to illustrate the power of our method. Our method achieves power comparable to task-specific normality tests such as Anderson-Darling and Lilliefors, despite being designed for general nonparametric alternatives.",

In recent years, Android graph-based deep learning research has proposed many approaches to extract relationships from applications as graphs to generate graph embeddings. First, we demonstrate the effectiveness of graph-based classification using a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based classifier to generate API graph embeddings. The graph embeddings are combined with Permission and Intent features to train multiple machine learning and deep learning models for Android malware detection. The proposed classification approach achieves an accuracy of 98.33 percent on the CICMaldroid dataset and 98.68 percent on the Drebin dataset. However, graph-based deep learning models are vulnerable, as attackers can add fake relationships to evade detection by the classifier. Second, we propose a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based attack algorithm named VGAE-MalGAN targeting graph-based GNN Android malware classifiers. The VGAE-MalGAN generator produces adversarial malware API graphs, while the VGAE-MalGAN substitute detector attempts to mimic the target detector. Experimental results show that VGAE-MalGAN can significantly reduce the detection rate of GNN-based malware classifiers. Although the model initially fails to detect adversarial malware, retraining with generated adversarial samples improves robustness and helps mitigate adversarial attacks.",

In a nation like Bangladesh, enhancing guava production and agricultural practices plays a crucial role in its economy. Anthracnose and fruit fly infection can lower the quality and productivity of guava, a crucial tropical fruit. Expert systems that detect diseases early can reduce losses and safeguard the harvest. Images of guava fruits classified into the Healthy, Fruit Flies, and Anthracnose classes are included in the Guava Fruit Disease Dataset 2024 (GFDD24), which comes from plantations in Rajshahi and Pabna, Bangladesh. This study aims to create models using CNN alongside traditional machine learning techniques that can effectively identify guava diseases in locally cultivated varieties in Bangladesh. In order to achieve the highest classification accuracy of approximately 99.99% for the guava dataset, we propose utilizing ensemble models that combine CNNML with Gradient Boosting Machine. In general, the CNN-ML cascade framework exhibits strong, high-accuracy guava disease detection that is appropriate for real-time agricultural monitoring systems.",

Standard Euclidean projection treats assets as independent and can ignore the covariance structure that governs portfolio risk, potentially producing less diversified portfolios. This paper introduces Covariance-Aware Simplex Projection (CASP), a two-stage repair operator that (i) selects a target number of assets using volatility-normalized scores and (ii) projects the candidate weights using a covariance-aware geometry aligned with tracking-error risk. This provides a portfolio-theoretic foundation for using a covariance-induced distance in repair operators. On S&P 500 data (2020-2024), CASP-Basic delivers materially lower portfolio variance than standard Euclidean repair without relying on return estimates, with improvements that are robust across assets and statistically significant. Ablation results indicate that volatility-normalized selection drives most of the variance reduction, while the covariance-aware projection provides an additional, consistent improvement. We further show that optional return-aware extensions can improve Sharpe ratios, and out-of-sample tests confirm that gains transfer to realized performance. CASP integrates as a drop-in replacement for Euclidean projection in metaheuristic portfolio optimizers.",

        "summary": "As Vision Transformers (ViTs) become standard vision backbones, a mechanistic account of their computational phenomenology is essential. Despite architectural cues that hint at dynamical structure, there is no settled framework that interprets Transformer depth as a well-characterized flow. In this work, we introduce the Block-Recurrent Hypothesis (BRH), arguing that trained ViTs admit a block-recurrent depth structure such that the computation of the original $L$ blocks can be accurately rewritten using only $k \\ll L$ distinct blocks applied recurrently. Across diverse ViTs, between-layer representational similarity matrices suggest few contiguous phases. To determine whether these phases reflect genuinely reusable computation, we train block-recurrent surrogates of pretrained ViTs: Recurrent Approximations to Phase-structured TransfORmers (Raptor). In small-scale, we demonstrate that stochastic depth and training promote recurrent structure and subsequently correlate with our ability to accurately fit Raptor. We then provide an empirical existence proof for BRH by training a Raptor model to recover $96\\%$ of DINOv2 ImageNet-1k linear probe accuracy in only 2 blocks at equivalent computational cost. Finally, we leverage our hypothesis to develop a program of Dynamical Interpretability. We find i) directional convergence into class-dependent angular basins with self-correcting trajectories under small perturbations, ii) token-specific dynamics, where cls executes sharp late reorientations while patch tokens exhibit strong late-stage coherence toward their mean direction, and iii) a collapse to low rank updates in late depth, consistent with convergence to low-dimensional attractors. Altogether, we find a compact recurrent program emerges along ViT depth, pointing to a low-complexity normative solution that enables these models to be studied through principled dynamical systems analysis.",

        "summary": "We develop a data-driven framework for discovering constitutive relations in models of fluid flow and scalar transport. Our approach infers unknown closure terms in the governing equations (gray-box discovery) under the assumption that the temporal derivative, convective transport, and pressure-gradient contributions are known. The formulation is rooted in a variational principle from nonequilibrium thermodynamics, where the dynamics is defined by a free-energy functional and a dissipation functional. The unknown constitutive terms arise as functional derivatives of these functionals with respect to the state variables. To enable a flexible and structured model discovery, the free-energy and dissipation functionals are parameterized using neural networks, while their functional derivatives are obtained via automatic differentiation. This construction enforces thermodynamic consistency by design, ensuring monotonic decay of the total free energy and non-negative entropy production. The resulting method, termed GIMLET (Generalizable and Interpretable Model Learning through Embedded Thermodynamics), avoids reliance on a predefined library of candidate functions, unlike sparse regression or symbolic identification approaches. The learned models are generalizable in that functionals identified from one dataset can be transferred to distinct datasets governed by the same underlying equations. Moreover, the inferred free-energy and dissipation functions provide direct physical interpretability of the learned dynamics. The framework is demonstrated on several benchmark systems, including the viscous Burgers equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations for both Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.",

Existing approaches lack effective learning of vehicle-related knowledge during pre-training, resulting in poor capability for modeling general vehicle perception representations. To handle this problem, we propose VehicleMAE-V2, a novel vehicle-centric pre-trained large model. By exploring and exploiting vehicle-related multimodal structured priors to guide the masked token reconstruction process, our approach can significantly enhance the model's capability to learn generalizable representations for vehicle-centric perception. Specifically, we design the Symmetry-guided Mask Module (SMM), Contour-guided Representation Module (CRM) and Semantics-guided Representation Module (SRM) to incorporate three kinds of structured priors into token reconstruction including symmetry, contour and semantics of vehicles respectively. SMM utilizes the vehicle symmetry constraints to avoid retaining symmetric patches and can thus select high-quality masked image patches and reduce information redundancy. CRM minimizes the probability distribution divergence between contour features and reconstructed features and can thus preserve holistic vehicle structure information during pixel-level reconstruction. SRM aligns image-text features through contrastive learning and cross-modal distillation to address the feature confusion caused by insufficient semantic understanding during masked reconstruction. To support the pre-training of VehicleMAE-V2, we construct Autobot4M, a large-scale dataset comprising approximately 4 million vehicle images and 12,693 text descriptions. Extensive experiments on five downstream tasks demonstrate the superior performance of VehicleMAE-V2.",

We address these problems by introducing a convex loss function that is well-suited for both probabilistic and quasiprobabilistic density ratio estimation. To quantify performance, an extended version of the Sliced-Wasserstein distance is introduced which is compatible with quasiprobability distributions.

We present UCCL-EP, a portable EP communication system that delivers DeepEP-level performance across heterogeneous GPU and NIC hardware. UCCL-EP replaces GPU-initiated RDMA with a high-throughput GPU-CPU control channel: compact token-routing commands are transferred to multithreaded CPU proxies, which then issue GPUDirect RDMA operations on behalf of GPUs. UCCL-EP further emulates various ordering semantics required by specialized EP communication modes using RDMA immediate data, enabling correctness on NICs that lack such ordering, e.g., AWS EFA. We implement UCCL-EP on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs with EFA and Broadcom NICs. On EFA, it outperforms the best existing EP solution by up to $2.1\\times$ for dispatch and combine throughput. On NVIDIA-only platform, UCCL-EP achieves comparable performance to the original DeepEP. UCCL-EP also improves token throughput on SGLang by up to 40% on the NVIDIA+EFA platform, and improves DeepSeek-V3 training throughput over the AMD Primus/Megatron-LM framework by up to 45% on a 16-node AMD+Broadcom platform.",

        "summary": "One of the primary applications of classical Boltzmann machines is generative modeling, wherein the goal is to tune the parameters of a model distribution so that it closely approximates a target distribution. Training relies on estimating the gradient of the relative entropy between the target and model distributions, a task that is well understood when the classical Boltzmann machine has both visible and hidden units. For some years now, it has been an obstacle to generalize this finding to quantum state learning with quantum Boltzmann machines that have both visible and hidden units. In this paper, I derive an analytical expression for the gradient of the quantum relative entropy between a target quantum state and the reduced state of the visible units of a quantum Boltzmann machine. Crucially, this expression is amenable to estimation on a quantum computer, as it involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations reminiscent of those appearing in my prior work on rotated Petz recovery maps. This leads to a quantum algorithm for gradient estimation in this setting. I then specialize the setting to quantum visible units and classical hidden units, and vice versa, and provide analytical expressions for the gradients, along with quantum algorithms for estimating them. Finally, I replace the quantum relative entropy objective function with the Petz-Tsallis relative entropy; here I develop an analytical expression for the gradient and sketch a quantum algorithm for estimating it, as an application of a novel formula for the derivative of the matrix power function, which also involves modular-flow-generated unitary rotations.

This computationally efficient clustering approach revealed specific monomer group interactions leading to different sequence arrangements, including alternating, random, block, and gradient copolymers, providing chemical insights for initial exploration. Building upon these insights, we trained artificial neural networks to achieve quantitative reactivity ratio predictions. We explored two integration strategies including direct feature concatenation, and cluster-specific training, which demonstrated performance enhancements for targeted chemical domains compared to general training with equivalent sample sizes. However, models utilizing complete datasets outperformed specialized models trained on focused subsets, revealing a fundamental trade-off between chemical specificity and data availability.

        "summary": "The dominant paradigm for Audio-Text Retrieval (ATR) relies on mini-batch-based contrastive learning. This process, however, is inherently limited by what we formalize as the Gradient Locality Bottleneck (GLB), which structurally prevents models from leveraging out-of-batch knowledge and thus impairs fine-grained and long-tail learning. While external knowledge-enhanced methods can alleviate the GLB, we identify a critical, unaddressed side effect: the Representation-Drift Mismatch (RDM), where a static knowledge base becomes progressively misaligned with the evolving model, turning guidance into noise. To address this dual challenge, we propose the Adaptive Self-improving Knowledge (ASK) framework, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play solution. ASK breaks the GLB via multi-grained knowledge injection, systematically mitigates RDM through dynamic knowledge refinement, and introduces a novel adaptive reliability weighting scheme to ensure consistent knowledge contributes to optimization. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets with superior, state-of-the-art performance justify the efficacy of our proposed ASK framework.",

        "summary": "Open Radio Access Network (O RAN) disaggregates conventional RAN into interoperable components, enabling flexible resource allocation, energy savings, and agile architectural design. In legacy deployments, the binding between logical functions and physical locations is static, which leads to inefficiencies under time varying traffic and resource conditions. We address this limitation by relaxing the fixed mapping and performing dynamic service function chain (SFC) provisioning with on the fly O CU selection. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and solve it using GRLDyP, i.e., a graph neural network (GNN) assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The proposed agent jointly selects routes and the O-CU location (from candidate sites) for each incoming service flow to minimize network energy consumption while satisfying quality of service (QoS) constraints. The GNN encodes the instantaneous network topology and resource utilization (e.g., CPU and bandwidth), and the DRL policy learns to balance grade of service, latency, and energy. We perform the evaluation of GRLDyP on a data set with 24-hour traffic traces from the city of Montreal, showing that dynamic O CU selection and routing significantly reduce energy consumption compared to a static mapping baseline, without violating QoS. The results highlight DRL based SFC provisioning as a practical control primitive for energy-aware, resource-adaptive O-RAN deployments.",

This study compares large language models, including GatorTron-Base (trained on clinical data), Llama 8B, and Mistral 7B, against models like BioBERT, DocBERT, BioClinicalBERT, Word2Vec, and Doc2Vec, setting benchmarks for predicting Shock in critically ill patients. Timely prediction of shock can enable early interventions, thus improving patient outcomes. Text data from 17,294 ICU stays of patients in the MIMIC III database were scored for length of stay > 24 hours and shock index (SI) > 0.7 to yield 355 and 87 patients with normal and abnormal SI-index, respectively. Both focal and cross-entropy losses were used during finetuning to address class imbalances. Our findings indicate that while GatorTron Base achieved the highest weighted recall of 80.5%, the overall performance metrics were comparable between SLMs and LLMs. This suggests that LLMs are not inherently superior to SLMs in predicting future clinical events despite their strong performance on text-based tasks. To achieve meaningful clinical outcomes, future efforts in training LLMs should prioritize developing models capable of predicting clinical trajectories rather than focusing on simpler tasks such as named entity recognition or phenotyping.",

        "summary": "AI agents are emerging as a practical way to run multi-step scientific workflows that interleave reasoning with tool use and verification, pointing to a shift from isolated AI-assisted steps toward \\emph{agentic science at scale}. This shift is increasingly feasible, as scientific tools and models can be invoked through stable interfaces and verified with recorded execution traces, and increasingly necessary, as AI accelerates scientific output and stresses the peer-review and publication pipeline, raising the bar for traceability and credible evaluation. However, scaling agentic science remains difficult: workflows are hard to observe and reproduce; many tools and laboratory systems are not agent-ready; execution is hard to trace and govern; and prototype AI Scientist systems are often bespoke, limiting reuse and systematic improvement from real workflow signals. We argue that scaling agentic science requires an infrastructure-and-ecosystem approach, instantiated in Bohrium+SciMaster. Bohrium acts as a managed, traceable hub for AI4S assets -- akin to a HuggingFace of AI for Science -- that turns diverse scientific data, software, compute, and laboratory systems into agent-ready capabilities. SciMaster orchestrates these capabilities into long-horizon scientific workflows, on which scientific agents can be composed and executed. Between infrastructure and orchestration, a \\emph{scientific intelligence substrate} organizes reusable models, knowledge, and components into executable building blocks for workflow reasoning and action, enabling composition, auditability, and improvement through use. We demonstrate this stack with eleven representative master agents in real workflows, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in end-to-end scientific cycle time and generating execution-grounded signals from real workloads at multi-million scale.",

Current solutions, such as post-hoc filtering or projection-based methods, often compromise structural novelty or disrupt key pharmacophores by forcing molecules into pre-defined synthetic templates. Herein, we introduce SynCraft, a reasoning-based framework that reframes synthesizability optimization not as a sequence translation task, but as a precise structural editing problem. Leveraging the emergent reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, SynCraft navigates the \"synthesis cliff\" where minimal structural modifications yield significant gains in synthetic feasibility. By predicting executable sequences of atom-level edits rather than generating SMILES strings directly, SynCraft circumvents the syntactic fragility of LLMs while harnessing their chemical intuition. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SynCraft outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in generating synthesizable analogs with high structural fidelity. Furthermore, through interaction-aware prompting, SynCraft successfully replicates expert medicinal chemistry intuition in editing PLK1 inhibitors and rescuing high-scoring but previously discarded RIPK1 candidates in previous molecular generation literatures.",

However, their deployment in dynamic, real-world environments is severely hin dered by high inference latency. While smooth robotic interaction requires control frequencies of 20 to 30 Hz, current VLA models typi cally operate at only 3-5 Hz on edge devices due to the memory bound nature of autoregressive decoding. Existing optimizations often require extensive retraining or compromise model accuracy. To bridge this gap, we introduce ActionFlow, a system-level inference framework tailored for resource-constrained edge plat forms. At the core of ActionFlow is a Cross-Request Pipelin ing strategy, a novel scheduler that redefines VLA inference as a macro-pipeline of micro-requests. The strategy intelligently batches memory-bound Decode phases with compute-bound Prefill phases across continuous time steps to maximize hardware utilization. Furthermore, to support this scheduling, we propose a Cross Request State Packed Forward operator and a Unified KV Ring Buffer, which fuse fragmented memory operations into efficient dense computations. Experimental results demonstrate that ActionFlow achieves a 2.55x improvement in FPS on the OpenVLA-7B model without retraining, enabling real-time dy namic manipulation on edge hardware.

Although Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a path toward intent-based networking, they introduce stochastic risks, including topology hallucinations and policy non-compliance. To mitigate this, we propose Graph-Symbolic Policy Enforcement and Control (G-SPEC), a neuro-symbolic framework that constrains probabilistic planning with deterministic verification. The architecture relies on a Governance Triad - a telecom-adapted agent (TSLAM-4B), a Network Knowledge Graph (NKG), and SHACL constraints. We evaluated G-SPEC on a simulated 450-node 5G Core, achieving zero safety violations and a 94.1% remediation success rate, significantly outperforming the 82.4% baseline. Ablation analysis indicates that NKG validation drives the majority of safety gains (68%), followed by SHACL policies (24%). Scalability tests on topologies ranging from 10K to 100K nodes demonstrate that validation latency scales as $O(k^{1.2})$ where $k$ is subgraph size. With a processing overhead of 142ms, G-SPEC is viable for SMO-layer operations.",

However, ensuring safety remains a critical challenge across many domains and tasks. Previous works on safe RL from human feedback (RLHF) first learn reward and cost models from offline data, then use constrained RL to optimize a safe policy. While such an approach works in the contextual bandits settings (LLMs), in long horizon continuous control tasks, errors in rewards and costs accumulate, leading to impairment in performance when used with constrained RL methods. To address these challenges, (a) instead of indirectly learning policies (from rewards and costs), we introduce a framework that learns a policy directly based on pairwise preferences regarding the agent's behavior in terms of rewards, as well as binary labels indicating the safety of trajectory segments; (b) we propose \\textsc{PreSa} (Preference and Safety Alignment), a method that combines preference learning module with safety alignment in a constrained optimization problem. This optimization problem is solved within a Lagrangian paradigm that directly learns reward-maximizing safe policy \\textit{without explicitly learning reward and cost models}, avoiding the need for constrained RL; (c) we evaluate our approach on continuous control tasks with both synthetic and real human feedback.

The recent increasing demand for edge computing and AI advancements drives the growth of data center storage capacity. Energy efficiency is a cost-effective way to combat climate change, cut energy costs, improve business competitiveness, and promote IT and environmental sustainability. Thus, optimizing data center energy management is the most important factor in the sustainability of the world. Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is used to represent the operational efficiency of the data center. Predicting PUE using Neural Networks provides an understanding of the effect of each feature on energy consumption, thus enabling targeted modifications of those key features to improve energy efficiency. In this paper, we have developed Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) based PUE prediction model and compared the model performance with GRU.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated effectiveness as zero-shot time series (TS) forecasters. The key challenge lies in tokenizing TS data into textual representations that align with LLMs' pre-trained knowledge. While existing work often relies on fine-tuning specialized modules to bridge this gap, a distinct, yet challenging, paradigm aims to leverage truly off-the-shelf LLMs without any fine-tuning whatsoever, relying solely on strategic tokenization of numerical sequences. The performance of these fully frozen models is acutely sensitive to the textual representation of the input data, as their parameters cannot adapt to distribution shifts. In this paper, we introduce a simple yet highly effective strategy to overcome this brittleness: injecting noise into the raw time series before tokenization. This non-invasive intervention acts as a form of inference-time augmentation, compelling the frozen LLM to extrapolate based on robust underlying temporal patterns rather than superficial numerical artifacts. We theoretically analyze this phenomenon and empirically validate its effectiveness across diverse benchmarks. Notably, to fully eliminate potential biases from data contamination during LLM pre-training, we introduce two novel TS datasets that fall outside all utilized LLMs' pre-training scopes, and consistently observe improved performance. This study provides a further step in directly leveraging off-the-shelf LLMs for time series forecasting.",

        "summary": "Molecular editing and optimization are multi-step problems that require iteratively improving properties while keeping molecules chemically valid and structurally similar. We frame both tasks as sequential, tool-guided decisions and introduce MolAct, an agentic reinforcement learning framework that employs a two-stage training paradigm: first building editing capability, then optimizing properties while reusing the learned editing behaviors. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to formalize molecular design as an Agentic Reinforcement Learning problem, where an LLM agent learns to interleave reasoning, tool-use, and molecular optimization. The framework enables agents to interact in multiple turns, invoking chemical tools for validity checking, property assessment, and similarity control, and leverages their feedback to refine subsequent edits. We instantiate the MolAct framework to train two model families: MolEditAgent for molecular editing tasks and MolOptAgent for molecular optimization tasks. In molecular editing, MolEditAgent-7B delivers 100, 95, and 98 valid add, delete, and substitute edits, outperforming strong closed \"thinking\" baselines such as DeepSeek-R1; MolEditAgent-3B approaches the performance of much larger open \"thinking\" models like Qwen3-32B-think. In molecular optimization, MolOptAgent-7B (trained on MolEditAgent-7B) surpasses the best closed \"thinking\" baseline (e.g., Claude 3.7) on LogP and remains competitive on solubility, while maintaining balanced performance across other objectives. These results highlight that treating molecular design as a multi-step, tool-augmented process is key to reliable and interpretable improvements.",

        "summary": "Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in informing investment decisions, assessing market risk, and predicting stock price trends. Existing works in financial sentiment analysis have not considered the impact of stock prices or market feedback on sentiment analysis. In this paper, we propose an adaptive framework that integrates large language models (LLMs) with real-world stock market feedback to improve sentiment classification in the context of the Indian stock market. The proposed methodology fine-tunes the LLaMA 3.2 3B model using instruction-based learning on the SentiFin dataset. To enhance sentiment predictions, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline is employed that dynamically selects multi-source contextual information based on the cosine similarity of the sentence embeddings. Furthermore, a feedback-driven module is introduced that adjusts the reliability of the source by comparing predicted sentiment with actual next-day stock returns, allowing the system to iteratively adapt to market behavior. To generalize this adaptive mechanism across temporal data, a reinforcement learning agent trained using proximal policy optimization (PPO) is incorporated. The PPO agent learns to optimize source weighting policies based on cumulative reward signals from sentiment-return alignment. Experimental results on NIFTY 50 news headlines collected from 2024 to 2025 demonstrate that the proposed system significantly improves classification accuracy, F1-score, and market alignment over baseline models and static retrieval methods. The results validate the potential of combining instruction-tuned LLMs with dynamic feedback and reinforcement learning for robust, market-aware financial sentiment modeling.",

Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong potential for policy-grounded moderation, the practical challenges of training these systems to achieve expert-level accuracy in real-world settings remain largely unexplored, particularly in regimes characterized by label sparsity, evolving policy definitions, and the need for nuanced reasoning beyond shallow pattern matching. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical investigation of scaling reinforcement learning (RL) for content classification, systematically evaluating multiple RL training recipes and reward-shaping strategies-including verifiable rewards and LLM-as-judge frameworks-to transform general-purpose language models into specialized, policy-aligned classifiers across three real-world content moderation tasks. Our findings provide actionable insights for industrial-scale moderation systems, demonstrating that RL exhibits sigmoid-like scaling behavior in which performance improves smoothly with increased training data, rollouts, and optimization steps before gradually saturating. Moreover, we show that RL substantially improves performance on tasks requiring complex policy-grounded reasoning while achieving up to 100x higher data efficiency than supervised fine-tuning, making it particularly effective in domains where expert annotations are scarce or costly.",

        "summary": "As Earth's climate changes, it is impacting disasters and extreme weather events across the planet. Record-breaking heat waves, drenching rainfalls, extreme wildfires, and widespread flooding during hurricanes are all becoming more frequent and more intense. Rapid and efficient response to disaster events is essential for climate resilience and sustainability. A key challenge in disaster response is to accurately and quickly identify disaster locations to support decision-making and resources allocation. In this paper, we propose a Probabilistic Cross-view Geolocalization approach, called ProbGLC, exploring new pathways towards generative location awareness for rapid disaster response. Herein, we combine probabilistic and deterministic geolocalization models into a unified framework to simultaneously enhance model explainability (via uncertainty quantification) and achieve state-of-the-art geolocalization performance. Designed for rapid diaster response, the ProbGLC is able to address cross-view geolocalization across multiple disaster events as well as to offer unique features of probabilistic distribution and localizability score. To evaluate the ProbGLC, we conduct extensive experiments on two cross-view disaster datasets (i.e., MultiIAN and SAGAINDisaster), consisting diverse cross-view imagery pairs of multiple disaster types (e.g., hurricanes, wildfires, floods, to tornadoes). Preliminary results confirms the superior geolocalization accuracy (i.e., 0.86 in Acc@1km and 0.97 in Acc@25km) and model explainability (i.e., via probabilistic distributions and localizability scores) of the proposed ProbGLC approach, highlighting the great potential of leveraging generative cross-view approach to facilitate location awareness for better and faster disaster response.

        "summary": "Learning from videos offers a promising path toward generalist robots by providing rich visual and temporal priors beyond what real robot datasets contain. While existing video generative models produce impressive visual predictions, they are difficult to translate into low-level actions. Conversely, latent-action models better align videos with actions, but they typically operate at the single-step level and lack high-level planning capabilities. We bridge this gap by introducing Skill Abstraction from Optical Flow (SOF), a framework that learns latent skills from large collections of action-free videos. Our key idea is to learn a latent skill space through an intermediate representation based on optical flow that captures motion information aligned with both video dynamics and robot actions. By learning skills in this flow-based latent space, SOF enables high-level planning over video-derived skills and allows for easier translation of these skills into actions. Experiments show that our approach consistently improves performance in both multitask and long-horizon settings, demonstrating the ability to acquire and compose skills directly from raw visual data.",

Both pursuits require knowledge of the underlying symmetries in data. To address this, we propose learning symmetries directly from data via flow matching on Lie groups. We formulate symmetry discovery as learning a distribution over a larger hypothesis group, such that the learned distribution matches the symmetries observed in data. Relative to previous works, our method, \\lieflow, is more flexible in terms of the types of groups it can discover and requires fewer assumptions. Experiments on 2D and 3D point clouds demonstrate the successful discovery of discrete groups, including reflections by flow matching over the complex domain. We identify a key challenge where the symmetric arrangement of the target modes causes ``last-minute convergence,'' where samples remain stationary until relatively late in the flow, and introduce a novel interpolation scheme for flow matching for symmetry discovery.",

        "summary": "The integration of embodied agents into human environments demands embodied social intelligence: reasoning over both social norms and physical constraints. However, existing evaluations fail to address this integration, as they are limited to either disembodied social reasoning (e.g., in text) or socially-agnostic physical tasks. Both approaches fail to assess an agent's ability to integrate and trade off both physical and social constraints within a realistic, embodied context. To address this challenge, we introduce Spatially Situated Social Intelligence Test (S$^{3}$IT), a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate embodied social intelligence. It is centered on a novel and challenging seat-ordering task, requiring an agent to arrange seating in a 3D environment for a group of large language model-driven (LLM-driven) NPCs with diverse identities, preferences, and intricate interpersonal relationships. Our procedurally extensible framework generates a vast and diverse scenario space with controllable difficulty, compelling the agent to acquire preferences through active dialogue, perceive the environment via autonomous exploration, and perform multi-objective optimization within a complex constraint network. We evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs on S$^{3}$IT and found that they still struggle with this problem, showing an obvious gap compared with the human baseline. Results imply that LLMs have deficiencies in spatial intelligence, yet simultaneously demonstrate their ability to achieve near human-level competence in resolving conflicts that possess explicit textual cues.",

        "summary": "Intra-class variability is given according to the significance in the degree of dissimilarity between images within a class. In that sense, depending on its intensity, intra-class variability can hinder the learning process for DL models, specially when such classes are also underrepresented, which is a very common scenario in Fine-Grained Visual Categorization (FGVC) tasks. This paper proposes a novel method that aims at leveraging classification performance in FGVC tasks by learning fine-grained features via classification of class-wise cluster assignments. Our goal is to apply clustering over each class individually, which can allow to discover pseudo-labels that encodes a latent degree of similarity between images. In turn, those labels can be employed in a hierarchical classification process that allows to learn more fine-grained visual features and thereby mitigating intra-class variability issues. Initial experiments over the PlantNet300k enabled to shed light upon several key points in which future work will have to be developed in order to find more conclusive evidence regarding the effectiveness of our method.

Our solution focused on employing class prototypes obtained from the training dataset as a proxy guidance for training a segmentation Vision Transformer (ViT) on the test set images. To obtain these representations, the proposed method extracts features from training dataset images and create clusters, by applying K-Means, with $K$ equals to the number of classes in the dataset. The segmentation model is a customized narrow ViT, built by replacing the patch embedding layer with a frozen DinoV2, pre-trained on the training dataset for individual species classification. This model is trained to reconstruct the class prototypes of the training dataset from the test dataset images. We then use this model to obtain attention scores that enable to identify and localize areas of interest and consequently guide the classification process. The proposed approach enabled a domain-adaptation from multi-class identification with individual species, into multi-label classification from high-resolution vegetation plots.

While LLMs do not possess a human psychology, they often can emulate human behaviors with sufficiently high fidelity to drive simulations to test human behavioral hypotheses, exhibiting more nuance and range than the rule-based agents often employed in behavioral economics. One key area of interest is the effect of personality on decision making, but the requirement that a prompt must be created for every tested personality profile introduces experimental overhead and degrades replicability. To address this issue, we leverage interpolative decoding, representing each dimension of personality as a pair of opposed prompts and employing an interpolation parameter to simulate behavior along the dimension. We show that interpolative decoding reliably modulates scores along each of the Big Five dimensions. We then show how interpolative decoding causes LLMs to mimic human decision-making behavior in economic games, replicating results from human psychological research. Finally, we present preliminary results of our efforts to ``twin'' individual human players in a collaborative game through systematic search for points in interpolation space that cause the system to replicate actions taken by the human subject.",

In major disasters, prepositioned supplies often fall short of meeting all demands. We address the problem of planning vehicle routes from a distribution center to shelters while allocating limited relief supplies. To balance efficiency and equity, we formulate a bi-objective problem: minimizing a Gini-index-based measure of inequity in unsatisfied demand for fair distribution and minimizing total travel time for timely delivery. We propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model and use the $ε$-constraint method to handle the bi-objective nature. By deriving mathematical properties of the optimal solution, we introduce valid inequalities and design an algorithm for optimal delivery allocations given feasible vehicle routes. A branch-and-price (B&P) algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently. Computational tests on realistic datasets from a past earthquake in Van, Turkey, and predicted data for Istanbul's Kartal region show that the B&P algorithm significantly outperforms commercial MIP solvers. Our bi-objective approach reduces aid distribution inequity by 34% without compromising efficiency. Results indicate that when time constraints are very loose or tight, lexicographic optimization prioritizing demand coverage over fairness is effective. For moderately restrictive time constraints, a balanced approach is essential to avoid inequitable outcomes.",

        "summary": "As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.",

        "summary": "Maintaining large-scale, multilingual codebases hinges on accurately localizing issues, which requires mapping natural-language error descriptions to the relevant functions that need to be modified. However, existing ranking approaches are often Python-centric and perform a single-pass search over the codebase. This work introduces SweRank+, a framework that couples SweRankMulti, a cross-lingual code ranking tool, with SweRankAgent, an agentic search setup, for iterative, multi-turn reasoning over the code repository. SweRankMulti comprises a code embedding retriever and a listwise LLM reranker, and is trained using a carefully curated large-scale issue localization dataset spanning multiple popular programming languages. SweRankAgent adopts an agentic search loop that moves beyond single-shot localization with a memory buffer to reason and accumulate relevant localization candidates over multiple turns. Our experiments on issue localization benchmarks spanning various languages demonstrate new state-of-the-art performance with SweRankMulti, while SweRankAgent further improves localization over single-pass ranking.",

        "summary": "Accurate segmentation of ischemic stroke lesions from diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is essential for clinical decision-making and outcome assessment. Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) and Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC) scans provide complementary information on acute and sub-acute ischemic changes; however, automated lesion delineation remains challenging due to variability in lesion appearance. In this work, we study ischemic stroke lesion segmentation using multimodal diffusion MRI from the ISLES 2022 dataset. Several state-of-the-art convolutional and transformer-based architectures, including U-Net variants, Swin-UNet, and TransUNet, are benchmarked. Based on performance, a dual-encoder TransUNet architecture is proposed to learn modality-specific representations from DWI and ADC inputs. To incorporate spatial context, adjacent slice information is integrated using a three-slice input configuration. All models are trained under a unified framework and evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC). Results show that transformer-based models outperform convolutional baselines, and the proposed dual-encoder TransUNet achieves the best performance, reaching a Dice score of 85.4% on the test set. The proposed framework offers a robust solution for automated ischemic stroke lesion segmentation from diffusion MRI.",

While providing a reproducible toolkit to generate, intercept and analyze DoH exfiltration, and comparing Machine Learning vs threshold-based detection under adversarial scenarios. The originality of this project is the introduction of an end-to-end, containerized pipeline that generates configurable file exfiltration over DoH using several parameters (e.g., chunking, encoding, padding, resolver rotation). It allows for file reconstruction at the resolver side, while extracting flow-level features using a fork of DoHLyzer. The pipeline contains a prediction side, which allows the training of machine learning models based on public labelled datasets and then evaluates them side-by-side with threshold-based detection methods against malicious and evasive DNS-Over-HTTPS traffic. We train Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and Logistic Regression classifiers on a public DoH dataset and benchmark them against evasive DoH exfiltration scenarios. The toolkit orchestrates traffic generation, file capture, feature extraction, model training and analysis. The toolkit is then encapsulated into several Docker containers for easy setup and full reproducibility regardless of the platform it is run on. Future research regarding this project is directed at validating the results on mixed enterprise traffic, extending the protocol coverage to HTTP/3/QUIC request, adding a benign traffic generation, and working on real-time traffic evaluation. A key objective is to quantify when stealth constraints make DoH exfiltration uneconomical and unworthy for the attacker.",

We explore exocentric video with ambient sensors as a non-intrusive, scalable alternative. While prior egocentric-wearable works predominantly adopt Global Alignment by encoding entire sequences into unified representations, this approach fails in exocentric-ambient settings due to two problems: (P1) inability to capture local details such as subtle motions, and (P2) over-reliance on modality-invariant temporal patterns, causing misalignment between actions sharing similar temporal patterns with different spatio-semantic contexts. To resolve these problems, we propose DETACH, a decomposed spatio-temporal framework. This explicit decomposition preserves local details, while our novel sensor-spatial features discovered via online clustering provide semantic grounding for context-aware alignment. To align the decomposed features, our two-stage approach establishes spatial correspondence through mutual supervision, then performs temporal alignment via a spatial-temporal weighted contrastive loss that adaptively handles easy negatives, hard negatives, and false negatives. Comprehensive experiments with downstream tasks on Opportunity++ and HWU-USP datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over adapted egocentric-wearable baselines.",

It refers to a design style that enables systems to be developed as suites of small, loosely coupled, and autonomous components (services) that encapsulate functionality and communicate via language-agnostic APIs. However, defining appropriately sized services that capture cohesive subsets of system functionality remains challenging. Existing work often relies on the availability of documentation, access to project personnel, or a priori knowledge of the target number of services, assumptions that do not hold in many real-world scenarios. Our work addresses these limitations using a deep reinforcement learning-based approach to identify appropriately sized services directly from implementation artifacts. We present Rake, a reinforcement learning-based technique that leverages available system documentation and source code to guide service decomposition at the level of implementation methods. Rake does not require specific documentation or access to project personnel and is language-agnostic. It also supports a customizable objective function that balances modularization quality and business capability alignment, i.e., the degree to which a service covers the targeted business capability. We applied Rake to four open-source legacy projects and compared it with two state-of-the-art techniques. On average, Rake achieved 7-14 percent higher modularization quality and 18-22 percent stronger business capability alignment. Our results further show that optimizing solely for business context can degrade decomposition quality in tightly coupled systems, highlighting the need for balanced objectives.",

        "summary": "A major shortcoming of medical practice is the lack of an objective measure of conscious level. Impairment of consciousness is common, e.g. following brain injury and seizures, which can also interfere with sensory processing and volitional responses. This is also an important pitfall in neurophysiological methods that infer awareness via command following, e.g. using functional MRI or electroencephalography (EEG). Transcranial electrical stimulation (TES) can be employed to non-invasively stimulate the brain, bypassing sensory inputs, and has already showed promising results in providing reliable indicators of brain state. However, current non-invasive solutions have been limited to magnetic stimulation, which is not easily translatable to clinical settings. Our long-term vision is to develop an objective measure of brain state that can be used at the bedside, without requiring patients to understand commands or initiate motor responses. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of a framework using Deep Learning algorithms to classify EEG brain responses evoked by a defined multi-dimensional pattern of TES. We collected EEG-TES data from 11 participants and found that delivering transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) to posterior cortical areas targeting the angular gyrus elicited an exceptionally reliable brain response. For this paradigm, our best Convolutional Neural Network model reached a 92% classification F1-score on Holdout data from participants never seen during training, significantly surpassing human-level performance at 60-70% accuracy. These findings establish a framework for robust consciousness measurement for clinical use. In this spirit, we documented and open-sourced our datasets and codebase in full, to be used freely by the neuroscience and AI research communities, who may replicate our results with free tools like GitHub, Kaggle, and Colab.",

In this paper, we introduce TAVID, a unified framework that generates both interactive faces and conversational speech in a synchronized manner. TAVID integrates face and speech generation pipelines through two cross-modal mappers (i.e., a motion mapper and a speaker mapper), which enable bidirectional exchange of complementary information between the audio and visual modalities.

This progress is driven by increasingly sophisticated model architectures, such as ResNets, Vision Transformers, and Hybrid Convolutional Neural Networks, that offer enhanced performance at the cost of greater complexity. This complexity often compromises model explainability and interpretability. SHAP has emerged as a prominent method for providing interpretable visualizations that aid domain experts in understanding model predictions. However, SHAP explanations can be unstable and unreliable in the presence of epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty. In this study, we address this challenge by using Dirichlet posterior sampling and Dempster-Shafer theory to quantify the uncertainty that arises from these unstable explanations in medical imaging applications. The framework uses a belief, plausible, and fusion map approach alongside statistical quantitative analysis to produce quantification of uncertainty in SHAP. Furthermore, we evaluated our framework on three medical imaging datasets with varying class distributions, image qualities, and modality types which introduces noise due to varying image resolutions and modality-specific aspect covering the examples from pathology, ophthalmology, and radiology, introducing significant epistemic uncertainty.",

Despite recent progress, existing WSCOD methods still lag far behind fully supervised ones due to two major limitations: (1) the pseudo masks generated by general-purpose segmentation models (e.g., SAM) and filtered via rules are often unreliable, as these models lack the task-specific semantic understanding required for effective pseudo labeling in COD; and (2) the neglect of inherent annotation bias in scribbles, which hinders the model from capturing the global structure of camouflaged objects. To overcome these challenges, we propose ${D}^{3}$ETOR, a two-stage WSCOD framework consisting of Debate-Enhanced Pseudo Labeling and Frequency-Aware Progressive Debiasing. In the first stage, we introduce an adaptive entropy-driven point sampling method and a multi-agent debate mechanism to enhance the capability of SAM for COD, improving the interpretability and precision of pseudo masks. In the second stage, we design FADeNet, which progressively fuses multi-level frequency-aware features to balance global semantic understanding with local detail modeling, while dynamically reweighting supervision strength across regions to alleviate scribble bias. By jointly exploiting the supervision signals from both the pseudo masks and scribble semantics, ${D}^{3}$ETOR significantly narrows the gap between weakly and fully supervised COD, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks.",

The linear accumulation (O(N)) of Key-Value states treats context as a warehouse of static artifacts, eventually forcing a destructive choice between amnesia and latency. We challenge this discrete orthodoxy, proposing that long-term memory is not the storage of items, but the persistence of a trajectory. We introduce Phonetic Trajectory Memory (PTM), a neuro-symbolic architecture that encodes language not as a sequence of tensors, but as a continuous path on an ergodic manifold governed by irrational rotation matrices. By decoupling the navigation (an invariant O(1) geometric signal) from the reconstruction (a probabilistic generative act), PTM achieves a compression magnitude of greater than 3,000x relative to dense caches. We demonstrate that retrieval becomes a process of resonance: the phonetic trace stabilizes the model against hallucination via \"Signal Consensus\" mechanism, securing up to approximately 92% factual accuracy. While this aggressive abstraction alters generative texture, it unlocks immediate access latency (approximately 34ms) independent of depth. Our results suggest that infinite context does not require infinite silicon; it requires treating memory not as data to be stored, but as a reconstructive process acting on a conserved, undying physical signal.",

As a result, policy performance is constrained by the low inference speed of large VLMs. This mandatory synchronous execution severely limits control stability and real-time performance in whole-body robotic manipulation, which involves more joints, larger motion spaces, and dynamically changing views. We introduce a truly asynchronous Fast-Slow VLA framework (DuoCore-FS), organizing the system into a fast pathway for high-frequency action generation and a slow pathway for rich VLM reasoning. The system is characterized by two key features. First, a latent representation buffer bridges the slow and fast systems. It stores instruction semantics and action-reasoning representation aligned with the scene-instruction context, providing high-level guidance to the fast pathway. Second, a whole-body action tokenizer provides a compact, unified representation of whole-body actions. Importantly, the VLM and action expert are still jointly trained end-to-end, preserving unified policy learning while enabling asynchronous execution. DuoCore-FS supports a 3B-parameter VLM while achieving 30 Hz whole-body action-chunk generation, approximately three times as fast as prior VLA models with comparable model sizes. Real-world whole-body manipulation experiments demonstrate improved task success rates and significantly enhanced responsiveness compared to synchronous Fast-Slow VLA baselines.

Conventional rule-based metrics merely score programs based on their surface-level similarities with reference programs instead of analyzing functionality and code quality in depth. To address this limitation, researchers have developed LLM-as-a-judge metrics, prompting LLMs to evaluate and score code, and curated various code evaluation benchmarks to validate their effectiveness. However, these benchmarks suffer from critical limitations, hindering reliable assessments of evaluation capability: Some feature coarse-grained binary labels, which reduce rich code behavior to a single bit of information, obscuring subtle errors. Others propose fine-grained but subjective, vaguely-defined evaluation criteria, introducing unreliability in manually-annotated scores, which is the ground-truth they rely on. Furthermore, they often use uncontrolled data synthesis methods, leading to unbalanced score distributions that poorly represent real-world code generation scenarios. To curate a diverse benchmark with programs of well-balanced distributions across various quality levels and streamline the manual annotation procedure, we propose AXIOM, a novel perturbation-based framework for synthesizing code evaluation benchmarks at scale. It reframes program scores as the refinement effort needed for deployment, consisting of two stages: (1) Rule-guided perturbation, which prompts LLMs to apply sequences of predefined perturbation rules to existing high-quality programs to modify their functionality and code quality, enabling us to precisely control each program's target score to achieve balanced score distributions.

Recent studies use a neural predictor to guide the process, but the high computational costs of gathering training data -- since each label requires fully training an architecture -- make achieving a high-precision predictor with { limited compute budget (i.e., a capped number of fully trained architecture-label pairs)} crucial for ENAS success. This paper introduces ENAS with Dual Contrastive Learning (DCL-ENAS), a novel method that employs two stages of contrastive learning to train the neural predictor. In the first stage, contrastive self-supervised learning is used to learn meaningful representations from neural architectures without requiring labels. In the second stage, fine-tuning with contrastive learning is performed to accurately predict the relative performance of different architectures rather than their absolute performance, which is sufficient to guide the evolutionary search. Across NASBench-101 and NASBench-201, DCL-ENAS achieves the highest validation accuracy, surpassing the strongest published baselines by 0.05\\% (ImageNet16-120) to 0.39\\% (NASBench-101). On a real-world ECG arrhythmia classification task, DCL-ENAS improves performance by approximately 2.5 percentage points over a manually designed, non-NAS model obtained via random search, while requiring only 7.7 GPU-days.",

IRSN extracts features of each item region using item region pooling (IRP), analyzes them separately, and combines them using gated feature fusion (GFF). In addition, we improve the feature extractor by applying a dual-backbone architecture that combines a domain-specific feature extractor and a general feature extractor pre-trained with a large-scale image-text dataset. In experiments, applying IRSN to six widely-used backbones, including EfficientNet, ConvNeXt, and Swin Transformer, improved style classification accuracy by an average of 6.9% and a maximum of 14.5% on the FashionStyle14 dataset and by an average of 7.6% and a maximum of 15.1% on the ShowniqV3 dataset.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show significant promise in automating software vulnerability analysis, a critical task given the impact of security failure of modern software systems. However, current approaches in using LLMs to automate vulnerability analysis mostly rely on using online API-based LLM services, requiring the user to disclose the source code in development. Moreover, they predominantly frame the task as a binary classification(vulnerable or not vulnerable), limiting potential practical utility. This paper addresses these limitations by reformulating the problem as Software Vulnerability Identification (SVI), where LLMs are asked to output the type of weakness in Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) IDs rather than simply indicating the presence or absence of a vulnerability. We also tackle the reliance on large, API-based LLMs by demonstrating that instruction-tuning smaller, locally deployable LLMs can achieve superior identification performance. In our analysis, instruct-tuning a local LLM showed better overall performance and cost trade-off than online API-based LLMs. Our findings indicate that instruct-tuned local models represent a more effective, secure, and practical approach for leveraging LLMs in real-world vulnerability management workflows.",

This gap limits the effectiveness of image understanding in domains like journalism, education, and digital archives, where richer, more informative descriptions are essential. To address this, we propose a multimodal pipeline that augments visual input with external textual knowledge. Our system retrieves semantically similar images using BEIT-3 (Flickr30k-384 and COCO-384) and SigLIP So-384, reranks them using ORB and SIFT for geometric alignment, and extracts contextual information from related articles via semantic search. A fine-tuned Qwen3 model with QLoRA then integrates this context with base captions generated by Instruct BLIP (Vicuna-7B) to produce event-enriched, context-aware descriptions. Evaluated on the OpenEvents v1 dataset, our approach generates significantly more informative captions compared to traditional methods, showing strong potential for real-world applications requiring deeper visual-textual understanding",

We study this setting of manipulating personal objects, in which a VLA must identify and control a user-specific object unseen during training using only a few reference images. To address this challenge, we propose Visual Attentive Prompting (VAP), a simple-yet-effective training-free perceptual adapter that equips frozen VLAs with top-down selective attention. VAP treats the reference images as a non-parametric visual memory, grounds the personal object in the scene through open-vocabulary detection and embedding-based matching, and then injects this grounding as a visual prompt by highlighting the object and rewriting the instruction. We construct two simulation benchmarks, Personalized-SIMPLER and Personalized-VLABench, and a real-world tabletop benchmark to evaluate personalized manipulation across multiple robots and tasks. Experiments show that VAP consistently outperforms generic policies and token-learning baselines in both success rate and correct-object manipulation, helping to bridge the gap between semantic understanding and instance-level control.",

We analyze Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen2.5-Coder-32B on multilingual inputs in C++, Java, Python, Go, and JavaScript, measuring neuron selectivity and layerwise contributions during generation. We find (1) neurons specialized for individual languages alongside a universal subset supporting general-purpose generation; and (2) lower layers mainly encode language-specific syntax, while middle layers capture semantic abstractions shared across languages, emerging as concept layers. We demonstrate utility on three tasks: neuron-guided fine-tuning for code generation, clone detection via concept-layer embeddings, and concept-layer-guided transfer for code summarization, each yielding consistent gains in multilingual settings.",

        "summary": "The performance of quantum neural network models depends strongly on architectural decisions, including circuit depth, placement of parametrized operations, and data-encoding strategies. Selecting an effective architecture is challenging and closely related to the classical difficulty of choosing suitable neural-network topologies, which is computationally hard. This work investigates automated quantum-circuit construction for regression tasks and introduces a genetic-algorithm framework that discovers Reduced Regressor QNN architectures. The approach explores depth, parametrized gate configurations, and flexible data re-uploading patterns, formulating the construction of quantum regressors as an optimization process. The discovered circuits are evaluated against seventeen classical regression models on twenty-two nonlinear benchmark functions and four analytical functions. Although classical methods often achieve comparable results, they typically require far more parameters, whereas the evolved quantum models remain compact while providing competitive performance. We further analyze dataset complexity using twelve structural descriptors and show, across five increasingly challenging meta-learning scenarios, that these measures can reliably predict which quantum architecture will perform best. The results demonstrate perfect or near-perfect predictive accuracy in several scenarios, indicating that complexity metrics offer powerful and compact representations of dataset structure and can effectively guide automated model selection. Overall, this study provides a principled basis for meta-learning-driven quantum architecture design and advances the understanding of how quantum models behave in regression settings--a topic that has received limited exploration in prior work. These findings pave the way for more systematic and theoretically grounded approaches to quantum regression.",

This involves aligning both the cortical surface of the brain and the interior volume. Traditional methods treat volumetric and surface-based registration separately, which often leads to inconsistencies that limit downstream analyses. We propose a deep learning framework, NeurAlign, that registers $3$D brain MRI images by jointly aligning both cortical and subcortical regions through a unified volume-and-surface-based representation. Our approach leverages an intermediate spherical coordinate space to bridge anatomical surface topology with volumetric anatomy, enabling consistent and anatomically accurate alignment. By integrating spherical registration into the learning, our method ensures geometric coherence between volume and surface domains. In a series of experiments on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets, our method consistently outperforms both classical and machine learning-based registration methods -- improving the Dice score by up to 7 points while maintaining regular deformation fields. Additionally, it is orders of magnitude faster than the standard method for this task, and is simpler to use because it requires no additional inputs beyond an MRI scan. With its superior accuracy, fast inference, and ease of use, NeurAlign sets a new standard for joint cortical and subcortical registration.",

Existing flocking algorithms often struggle with efficiency and scalability, particularly when potential collisions force drones into suboptimal trajectories. This paper presents a time-efficient prioritised scheduling algorithm that improves the initial formation process of drone flocks. The method assigns each drone a priority based on its number of potential collisions and its likelihood of reaching its target position without permanently obstructing other drones. Using this hierarchy, each drone computes an appropriate delay to ensure a collision-free path. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm successfully generates collision-free trajectories for flocks of up to 5000 drones and outperforms the coupling-degree-based heuristic prioritised planning method (CDH-PP) in both performance and computational efficiency.",

        "summary": "Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables wireless devices to collaboratively train a centralised model without sharing raw data, but repeated uplink transmission of model updates makes communication the dominant bottleneck. Over-the-air (OTA) aggregation alleviates this by exploiting the superposition property of the wireless channel, enabling simultaneous transmission and merging communication with computation. Digital OTA schemes extend this principle by incorporating the robustness of conventional digital communication, but current designs remain limited in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes. This work proposes a learned digital OTA framework that improves recovery accuracy, convergence behaviour, and robustness to challenging SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as state-of-the-art methods. The design integrates an unsourced random access (URA) codebook with vector quantisation and AMP-DA-Net, an unrolled approximate message passing (AMP)-style decoder trained end-to-end with the digital codebook and parameter server local training statistics. The proposed design extends OTA aggregation beyond averaging to a broad class of symmetric functions, including trimmed means and majority-based rules. Experiments on highly heterogeneous device datasets and varying numbers of active devices show that the proposed design extends reliable digital OTA operation by more than 10 dB into low SNR regimes while matching or improving performance across the full SNR range. The learned decoder remains effective under message corruption and nonlinear aggregation, highlighting the broader potential of end-to-end learned design for digital OTA communication in FEEL.",

        "summary": "Building deployment-ready LLM agents requires complex orchestration of tools, data sources, and control flow logic, yet existing systems tightly couple agent logic to specific programming languages and deployment models. We present a declarative system that separates agent workflow specification from implementation, enabling the same pipeline definition to execute across multiple backend languages (Java, Python, Go) and deployment environments (cloud-native, on-premises). Our key insight is that most agent workflows consist of common patterns -- data serialization, filtering, RAG retrieval, API orchestration -- that can be expressed through a unified DSL rather than imperative code. This approach transforms agent development from application programming to configuration, where adding new tools or fine-tuning agent behaviors requires only pipeline specification changes, not code deployment. Our system natively supports A/B testing of agent strategies, allowing multiple pipeline variants to run on the same backend infrastructure with automatic metric collection and comparison. We evaluate our approach on real-world e-commerce workflows at PayPal, processing millions of daily interactions. Our results demonstrate 60% reduction in development time, and 3x improvement in deployment velocity compared to imperative implementations. The language's declarative approach enables non-engineers to modify agent behaviors safely, while maintaining sub-100ms orchestration overhead. We show that complex workflows involving product search, personalization, and cart management can be expressed in under 50 lines of DSL compared to 500+ lines of imperative code.",
