        "summary": "LLMs-based agents increasingly operate in multi-agent environments where strategic interaction and coordination are required. While existing work has largely focused on individual agents or on interacting agents sharing explicit communication, less is known about how interacting agents coordinate implicitly. In particular, agents may engage in covert communication, relying on indirect or non-linguistic signals embedded in their actions rather than on explicit messages. This paper presents a game-theoretic study of covert communication in LLM-driven multi-agent systems. We analyse interactions across four canonical game-theoretic settings under different communication regimes, including explicit, restricted, and absent communication. Considering heterogeneous agent personalities and both one-shot and repeated games, we characterise when covert signals emerge and how they shape coordination and strategic outcomes.",

        "summary": "Chromatographic separation technology has been widely applied in pharmaceutical, chemical, and food industries due to its high efficiency. However, traditional human-dependent chromatographic process development faces challenges such as reliance on expert experience, long development cycles, and labor intensity. ChromR, a large language model (LLM)-driven platform for chromatographic process design and optimization, is presented in this work. The platform integrates ChromLLM, a domain-specific LLM trained for chromatography, along with a multi-agent system and an automated chromatographic experimental device. The multi-agent system comprises four agents: domain knowledge answering, experimental design, experimental execution, and data analysis. ChromR enables automatic completion of the entire workflow-including initial process parameter recommendation, experimental design, automated execution, data analysis, and multi-objective optimization. By utilizing ChromR, dependency on expert knowledge is effectively reduced, while labor input and development time are significantly decreased. Chromatographic purification of the extract of Ginkgo biloba leaf (EGBL) was selected as a case study. ChromR successfully developed a chromatographic process within one week that meets multiple objectives, including fraction quality and production efficiency, reducing development time to approximately one-seventh of that required by the conventional paradigm. An intelligent, automated, and universally applicable new paradigm was established for chromatographic process development.",

We define key architectural components, including agent orchestration, communication mechanisms, and control-flow strategies, and demonstrate how these enable rapid development of modular, domain-adaptive solutions. Three real-world case studies are tested in controlled, containerised pilots in telecommunications security, national heritage asset management, and utilities customer service automation. Initial empirical results show that, for these case studies, prototypes were delivered within two weeks and pilot-ready solutions within one month, suggesting reduced development overhead compared to conventional approaches and improved user accessibility. However, findings also reinforce limitations documented in the literature, including variability in LLM behaviour that leads to challenges in transitioning from prototype to production maturity. We conclude by outlining critical research directions for improving reliability, scalability, and governance in MAS architectures and the further work needed to mature MAS design patterns to mitigate the inherent challenges.",

However, due to insufficient collaborative and perceptual capabilities, existing methods are inadequate for scaling across diverse environmental conditions. To address these challenges, we propose PC2P, a novel distributed MAPF method derived from a Q-learning-based MARL framework. Initially, we introduce a personalized-enhanced communication mechanism based on dynamic graph topology, which ascertains the core aspects of ``who\" and ``what\" in interactive process through three-stage operations: selection, generation, and aggregation. Concurrently, we incorporate local crowd perception to enrich agents' heuristic observation, thereby strengthening the model's guidance for effective actions via the integration of static spatial constraints and dynamic occupancy changes. To resolve extreme deadlock issues, we propose a region-based deadlock-breaking strategy that leverages expert guidance to implement efficient coordination within confined areas. Experimental results demonstrate that PC2P achieves superior performance compared to state-of-the-art distributed MAPF methods in varied environments. Ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module for overall performance.",

        "summary": "Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs.

In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.",

This summary guides the model to avoid similar errors on new inputs, without modifying model weights. We evaluate FLEx on CounterBench, GSM8K, and ReasonIF. We find that FLEx consistently outperforms chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting across all three datasets and reduces up to 83\\% of CoT's remaining errors.",

In this work, we introduce ContextFocus, a lightweight activation steering approach that improves context faithfulness in such knowledge-conflict settings while preserving fluency and efficiency. Unlike prior approaches, our solution requires no model finetuning and incurs minimal inference-time overhead, making it highly efficient. We evaluate ContextFocus on the ConFiQA benchmark, comparing it against strong baselines including ContextDPO, COIECD, and prompting-based methods. Furthermore, we show that our method is complementary to prompting strategies and remains effective on larger models. Extensive experiments show that ContextFocus significantly improves contextual-faithfulness.

We introduce an attribution-based framework to analyze positional effects in short-context language modeling. Using layer conductance with a sliding-window approach, we quantify how each layer distributes importance across input positions, yielding layer-wise positional importance profiles. We find that these profiles are architecture-specific, stable across inputs, and invariant to lexical scrambling. Characterizing these profiles, we find prominent recency bias that increases with depth and subtle primacy bias that diminishes through model depth. Beyond positional structure, we also show that early layers preferentially weight content words over function words across all positions, while later layers lose this word-type differentiation.",

While recent work has explored automatic prompt optimization using textual gradients and self-refinement, most existing methods treat prompts as monolithic blocks of text, making it difficult to localize errors, preserve critical instructions, or prevent uncontrolled prompt growth. We introduce Modular Prompt Optimization (MPO), a schema-based prompt optimization framework that treats prompts as structured objects composed of fixed semantic sections, including system role, context, task description, constraints, and output format. MPO applies section-local textual gradients, generated by a critic language model, to refine each section independently while keeping the overall prompt schema fixed. Section updates are consolidated through de-duplication to reduce redundancy and interference between components, yielding an interpretable and robust optimization process. We evaluate MPO on two reasoning benchmarks, ARC-Challenge and MMLU, using LLaMA-3 8B-Instruct and Mistral-7B-Instruct as solver models. Across both benchmarks and models, MPO consistently outperforms an untuned structured prompt and the TextGrad baseline, achieving substantial accuracy gains without modifying model parameters or altering prompt structure. These results demonstrate that maintaining a fixed prompt schema while applying localized, section-wise optimization is an effective and practical approach for improving reasoning performance in small open-source LMs.",

To investigate and evaluate the safety impact of MLLMs responses on human behavior in daily life, we introduce SaLAD, a multimodal safety benchmark which contains 2,013 real-world image-text samples across 10 common categories, with a balanced design covering both unsafe scenarios and cases of oversensitivity. It emphasizes realistic risk exposure, authentic visual inputs, and fine-grained cross-modal reasoning, ensuring that safety risks cannot be inferred from text alone. We further propose a safety-warning-based evaluation framework that encourages models to provide clear and informative safety warnings, rather than generic refusals. Results on 18 MLLMs demonstrate that the top-performing models achieve a safe response rate of only 57.2% on unsafe queries. Moreover, even popular safety alignment methods limit effectiveness of the models in our scenario, revealing the vulnerabilities of current MLLMs in identifying dangerous behaviors in daily life.

These challenges are especially pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited parallel data constrains generalization and transfer. Understanding how multilingual models share knowledge across languages requires examining the interaction between representations, data availability, and training strategies. In this thesis, we study cross-lingual knowledge transfer in neural models and develop methods to improve robustness and generalization in multilingual settings, using machine translation as a central testbed. We analyze how similarity between languages influences transfer, how retrieval and auxiliary supervision can strengthen low-resource translation, and how fine-tuning on parallel data can introduce unintended trade-offs in large language models. We further examine the role of language diversity during training and show that increasing translation coverage improves generalization and reduces off-target behavior. Together, this work highlights how modeling choices and data composition shape multilingual learning and offers insights toward more inclusive and resilient multilingual NLP systems.",

We present SpeakerSleuth, a benchmark evaluating whether LALMs can reliably judge speaker consistency in multi-turn dialogues through three tasks reflecting real-world requirements. We construct 1,818 human-verified evaluation instances across four diverse datasets spanning synthetic and real speech, with controlled acoustic difficulty. Evaluating nine widely-used LALMs, we find that models struggle to reliably detect acoustic inconsistencies. For instance, given audio samples of the same speaker's turns, some models overpredict inconsistency, whereas others are overly lenient. Models further struggle to identify the exact turns that are problematic. When other interlocutors' turns are provided together, performance degrades dramatically as models prioritize textual coherence over acoustic cues, failing to detect even obvious gender switches for a speaker. On the other hand, models perform substantially better in choosing the audio that best matches the speaker among several acoustic variants, demonstrating inherent acoustic discrimination capabilities. These findings expose a significant bias in LALMs: they tend to prioritize text over acoustics, revealing fundamental modality imbalances that need to be addressed to build reliable audio-language judges.",

Surprisingly, little work has been done to ensure or even measure the quality of simulated students. In this work, we formally define the student simulation task, propose a set of evaluation metrics that span linguistic, behavioral, and cognitive aspects, and benchmark a wide range of student simulation methods on these metrics. We experiment on a real-world math tutoring dialogue dataset, where both automated and human evaluation results show that prompting strategies for student simulation perform poorly; supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization yield much better but still limited performance, motivating future work on this challenging task.",

Our experiments yield two key findings. First, under standard in-domain evaluation, fine-tuned encoders, specifically XLM-R-CRF, achieve the strongest performance, reaching 93.2\\% macro F1, outperforming generative approaches. Second, in a cross-municipality setting that evaluates transfer to unseen administrative contexts, these models suffer substantial performance degradation, whereas few-shot LLMs demonstrate greater robustness, with significantly smaller declines in performance. Despite this generalization advantage, the high computational cost of generative models currently constrains their practicality. As a result, lightweight fine-tuned encoders remain a more practical option for large-scale, real-world deployment.

In this paper, we introduce Doc-PP (Document Policy Preservation Benchmark), a novel benchmark constructed from real-world reports requiring reasoning across heterogeneous visual and textual elements under strict non-disclosure policies. Our evaluation highlights a systemic Reasoning-Induced Safety Gap: models frequently leak sensitive information when answers must be inferred through complex synthesis or aggregated across modalities, effectively circumventing existing safety constraints. Furthermore, we identify that providing extracted text improves perception but inadvertently facilitates leakage. To address these vulnerabilities, we propose DVA (Decompose-Verify-Aggregation), a structural inference framework that decouples reasoning from policy verification. Experimental results demonstrate that DVA significantly outperforms standard prompting defenses, offering a robust baseline for policy-compliant document understanding",

We find that option-boundary (newline) residual states often contain strong linearly decodable signals related to per-option correctness. Winner-identity probing reveals a two-stage progression: the winning *content position* becomes decodable immediately after the final option is processed, while the *output symbol* is represented closer to the answer emission position.

The experiments in this paper focus on testing small language models out of the box, fine-tuned, and run sequentially on the JFLEG and ASSET datasets using established metrics. The results show that while SLMs may learn certain behaviors well, their performance remains below strong baselines and current LLMs. The results also show that SLMs struggle with retaining meaning and hallucinations.

        "summary": "This paper presents a comprehensive empirical study on the safety alignment capabilities. We evaluate what matters for safety alignment in LLMs and LRMs to provide essential insights for developing more secure and reliable AI systems. We systematically investigate and compare the influence of six critical intrinsic model characteristics and three external attack techniques. Our large-scale evaluation is conducted using 32 recent, popular LLMs and LRMs across thirteen distinct model families, spanning a parameter scale from 3B to 235B. The assessment leverages five established safety datasets and probes model vulnerabilities with 56 jailbreak techniques and four CoT attack strategies, resulting in 4.6M API calls. Our key empirical findings are fourfold. First, we identify the LRMs GPT-OSS-20B, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking, and GPT-OSS-120B as the top-three safest models, which substantiates the significant advantage of integrated reasoning and self-reflection mechanisms for robust safety alignment. Second, post-training and knowledge distillation may lead to a systematic degradation of safety alignment. We thus argue that safety must be treated as an explicit constraint or a core optimization objective during these stages, not merely subordinated to the pursuit of general capability. Third, we reveal a pronounced vulnerability: employing a CoT attack via a response prefix can elevate the attack success rate by 3.34x on average and from 0.6% to 96.3% for Seed-OSS-36B-Instruct. This critical finding underscores the safety risks inherent in text-completion interfaces and features that allow user-defined response prefixes in LLM services, highlighting an urgent need for architectural and deployment safeguards. Fourth, roleplay, prompt injection, and gradient-based search for adversarial prompts are the predominant methodologies for eliciting unaligned behaviors in modern models.",

These complex narratives pose a significant threat, as hyperpartisanship drives political polarisation and institutional distrust, while PRCTs directly motivate real-world extremist violence, making their identification critical for social cohesion and public safety. However, existing resources are scarce, predominantly English-centric, and often analyse hyperpartisanship, stance, and rhetorical bias in isolation rather than as interrelated aspects of political discourse. To bridge this gap, we introduce \\textsc{PartisanLens}, the first multilingual dataset of \\num{1617} hyperpartisan news headlines in Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese, annotated in multiple political discourse aspects. We first evaluate the classification performance of widely used Large Language Models (LLMs) on this dataset, establishing robust baselines for the classification of hyperpartisan and PRCT narratives. In addition, we assess the viability of using LLMs as automatic annotators for this task, analysing their ability to approximate human annotation. Results highlight both their potential and current limitations. Next, moving beyond standard judgments, we explore whether LLMs can emulate human annotation patterns by conditioning them on socio-economic and ideological profiles that simulate annotator perspectives. At last, we provide our resources and evaluation, \\textsc{PartisanLens} supports future research on detecting partisan and conspiratorial narratives in European contexts.",

We construct a controlled, distribution-matched benchmark of factual documents and interleave diagnostic probes directly into the CPT loop, enabling epoch-level measurement of knowledge acquisition dynamics and changes in Out-Of-Domain (OOD) general skills (e.g., math). We further analyze how CPT reshapes knowledge circuits during training. Across three instruction-tuned LLMs and multiple CPT strategies, optimization and learning systematically diverge as loss decreases monotonically while factual learning is unstable and non-monotonic. Acquired facts are rarely consolidated, learning is strongly conditioned on prior exposure, and OOD performance degrades from early epochs. Circuit analysis reveals rapid reconfiguration of knowledge pathways across epochs, providing an explanation for narrow acquisition windows and systematic forgetting. These results show that loss optimization is misaligned with learning progress in CPT and motivate evaluation of stopping criteria based on task-level learning dynamics.",

        "summary": "Table Question Answering (TableQA) benefits significantly from table pruning, which extracts compact sub-tables by eliminating redundant cells to streamline downstream reasoning. However, existing pruning methods typically rely on sequential revisions driven by unreliable critique signals, often failing to detect the loss of answer-critical data. To address this limitation, we propose TabTrim, a novel table pruning framework which transforms table pruning from sequential revisions to gold trajectory-supervised parallel search. TabTrim derives a gold pruning trajectory using the intermediate sub-tables in the execution process of gold SQL queries, and trains a pruner and a verifier to make the step-wise pruning result align with the gold pruning trajectory. During inference, TabTrim performs parallel search to explore multiple candidate pruning trajectories and identify the optimal sub-table. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TabTrim achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse tabular reasoning tasks: TabTrim-8B reaches 73.5% average accuracy, outperforming the strongest baseline by 3.2%, including 79.4% on WikiTQ and 61.2% on TableBench.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) elicits long chain-of-thought reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but outcome-based rewards lead to coarse-grained advantage estimation. While existing approaches improve RLVR via token-level entropy or sequence-level length control, they lack a semantically grounded, step-level measure of reasoning progress. As a result, LLMs fail to distinguish necessary deduction from redundant verification: they may continue checking after reaching a correct solution and, in extreme cases, overturn a correct trajectory into an incorrect final answer. To remedy the lack of process supervision, we introduce a training-free probing mechanism that extracts intermediate confidence and correctness and combines them into a Step Potential signal that explicitly estimates the reasoning state at each step. Building on this signal, we propose Step Potential Advantage Estimation (SPAE), a fine-grained credit assignment method that amplifies potential gains, penalizes potential drops, and applies penalty after potential saturates to encourage timely termination. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show SPAE consistently improves accuracy while substantially reducing response length, outperforming strong RL baselines and recent efficient reasoning and token-level advantage estimation methods.

This paper presents an evaluation of AI text detection methods, including both traditional machine learning models and transformer-based architectures. We utilize two datasets, HC3 and DAIGT v2, to build a unified benchmark and apply a topic-based data split to prevent information leakage. This approach ensures robust generalization across unseen domains. Our experiments show that TF-IDF logistic regression achieves a reasonable baseline accuracy of 82.87%. However, deep learning models outperform it. The BiLSTM classifier achieves an accuracy of 88.86%, while DistilBERT achieves a similar accuracy of 88.11% with the highest ROC-AUC score of 0.96, demonstrating the strongest overall performance. The results indicate that contextual semantic modeling is significantly superior to lexical features and highlight the importance of mitigating topic memorization through appropriate evaluation protocols. The limitations of this work are primarily related to dataset diversity and computational constraints. In future work, we plan to expand dataset diversity and utilize parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods such as LoRA. We also plan to explore smaller or distilled models and employ more efficient batching strategies and hardware-aware optimization.",

We conduct a systematic layer-wise probing study of 58 psycholinguistic features across 10 transformer models, spanning encoder-only and decoder-only architectures, and compare three embedding extraction methods. We find that apparent localization of meaning is strongly method-dependent: contextualized embeddings yield higher feature-specific selectivity and different layer-wise profiles than isolated embeddings. Across models and methods, final-layer representations are rarely optimal for recovering psycholinguistic information with linear probes. Despite these differences, models exhibit a shared depth ordering of meaning dimensions, with lexical properties peaking earlier and experiential and affective dimensions peaking later. Together, these results show that where meaning \"lives\" in transformer models reflects an interaction between methodological choices and architectural constraints.",

The complete dataset of 3,190 questions spans three difficulty levels and underwent validation by one medical expert and four students, achieving 94.2 percent approval with substantial inter-rater agreement (Fleiss' kappa = 0.82). We benchmark seven open-source models on VietMed-MCQ.

We propose a principled revision of memorization evaluation for LLMs, arguing that PII leakage should be evaluated under low lexical cue conditions, where target PII cannot be reconstructed through prompt-induced generalization or pattern completion. We formalize Cue-Resistant Memorization (CRM) as a cue-controlled evaluation framework and a necessary condition for valid memorization evaluation, explicitly conditioning on prompt-target overlap cues. Using CRM, we conduct a large-scale multilingual re-evaluation of PII leakage across 32 languages and multiple memorization paradigms. Revisiting reconstruction-based settings, including verbatim prefix-suffix completion and associative reconstruction, we find that their apparent effectiveness is driven primarily by direct surface-form cues rather than by true memorization. When such cues are controlled for, reconstruction success diminishes substantially. We further examine cue-free generation and membership inference, both of which exhibit extremely low true positive rates. Overall, our results suggest that previously reported PII leakage is better explained by cue-driven behavior than by genuine memorization, highlighting the importance of cue-controlled evaluation for reliably quantifying privacy-relevant memorization in LLMs.",

Specifically, we first create a new dataset for neologism-aware machine translation and develop a search tool based on Wiktionary. The new dataset covers 16 languages and 75 translation directions and is derived from approximately 10 million records of an English Wiktionary dump. The retrieval corpus of the search tool is also constructed from around 3 million cleaned records of the Wiktionary dump. We then use it for training the translation agent with reinforcement learning (RL) and evaluating the accuracy of neologism-aware machine translation.

As humans cannot interpret thousands of documents, only a small subset of the training data can be presented as an explanation. Although the choice of which documents to include directly affects explanation quality, previous evaluations of such systems have largely ignored any selection strategies. To address this, we propose a novel selection relevance score, a retraining-free metric that quantifies how useful a set of examples is for explaining a model's output. We validate this score through fine-tuning experiments, confirming that it can predict whether a set of examples supports or undermines the model's predictions. Using this metric, we further show that common selection strategies often underperform random selection. Motivated by this finding, we propose a strategy that balances influence and representativeness, enabling better use of selection budgets than naively selecting the highest-ranking examples.",

Existing designs follow a fragmentation-compensation paradigm: they first break dialogue streams into isolated utterances for storage, then attempt to restore coherence via embedding-based retrieval. This process irreversibly damages narrative and causal flow, while biasing retrieval towards lexical similarity. We introduce membox, a hierarchical memory architecture centered on a Topic Loom that continuously monitors dialogue in a sliding-window fashion, grouping consecutive same-topic turns into coherent \"memory boxes\" at storage time. Sealed boxes are then linked by a Trace Weaver into long-range event-timeline traces, recovering macro-topic recurrences across discontinuities. Experiments on LoCoMo demonstrate that Membox achieves up to 68% F1 improvement on temporal reasoning tasks, outperforming competitive baselines (e.g., Mem0, A-MEM). Notably, Membox attains these gains while using only a fraction of the context tokens required by existing methods, highlighting a superior balance between efficiency and effectiveness. By explicitly modeling topic continuity, Membox offers a cognitively motivated mechanism for enhancing both coherence and efficiency in LLM agents.",

To ensure data quality, the benchmark is meticulously curated through a rigorous pipeline involving automated profiling and human verification, guaranteeing that all privacy labels are grounded in factual records. Extensive experiments on $\\textit{HearSay}$ yield three critical findings: $\\textbf{Significant Privacy Leakage}$: ALLMs inherently extract private attributes from voiceprints, reaching 92.89% accuracy on gender and effectively profiling social attributes. $\\textbf{Insufficient Safety Mechanisms}$: Alarmingly, existing safeguards are severely inadequate; most models fail to refuse privacy-intruding requests, exhibiting near-zero refusal rates for physiological traits. $\\textbf{Reasoning Amplifies Risk}$: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning exacerbates privacy risks in capable models by uncovering deeper acoustic correlations.

The functional contrasts between sentences characterized by right branching vs. center embedding or unambiguous vs. ambiguous relative clause attachment are also picked up by ID, but in a less marked way, and they do not correlate with the same processing phase. Further experiments using representational similarity and layer ablation confirm the same trends.

We compare LLM-generated counterfactuals with pragmatics-based perturbations as alternative ways to construct test cases for assessing the potential usefulness of explanations. Our results show that self-explanations consistently improve simulation accuracy for both LLM judges and humans, but the degree and stability of gains depend strongly on the perturbation strategy and judge strength.

With a comprehensive, tightly-controlled evaluation of 13 open-weight LLMs, we find that LLMs prefer institutionally-corroborated information (e.g., government or newspaper sources) over information from people and social media. However, these source preferences can be reversed by simply repeating information from less credible sources. To mitigate repetition effects and maintain consistent preferences, we propose a novel method that reduces repetition bias by up to 99.8%, while also maintaining at least 88.8% of original preferences.

        "summary": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged with remarkable capabilities in complex tasks through Chain-of-Thought reasoning, practical resource constraints have sparked interest in transferring these abilities to smaller models. However, achieving both domain performance and cross-domain generalization remains challenging. Existing approaches typically restrict students to following a single golden rationale and treat different reasoning paths independently. Due to distinct inductive biases and intrinsic preferences, alongside the student's evolving capacity and reasoning preferences during training, a teacher's \"optimal\" rationale could act as out-of-distribution noise. This misalignment leads to a degeneration of the student's latent reasoning distribution, causing suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose MIND, a capability-adaptive framework that transitions distillation from passive mimicry to active cognitive construction. We synthesize diverse teacher perspectives through a novel \"Teaching Assistant\" network. By employing a Feedback-Driven Inertia Calibration mechanism, this network utilizes inertia-filtered training loss to align supervision with the student's current adaptability, effectively enhancing performance while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MIND achieves state-of-the-art performance on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, and our sophisticated latent space analysis further confirms the mechanism of reasoning ability internalization.",

        "summary": "DeepSeek-OCR utilizes an optical 2D mapping approach to achieve high-ratio vision-text compression, claiming to decode text tokens exceeding ten times the input visual tokens. While this suggests a promising solution for the LLM long-context bottleneck, we investigate a critical question: \"Visual merit or linguistic crutch - which drives DeepSeek-OCR's performance?\" By employing sentence-level and word-level semantic corruption, we isolate the model's intrinsic OCR capabilities from its language priors. Results demonstrate that without linguistic support, DeepSeek-OCR's performance plummets from approximately 90% to 20%. Comparative benchmarking against 13 baseline models reveals that traditional pipeline OCR methods exhibit significantly higher robustness to such semantic perturbations than end-to-end methods. Furthermore, we find that lower visual token counts correlate with increased reliance on priors, exacerbating hallucination risks. Context stress testing also reveals a total model collapse around 10,000 text tokens, suggesting that current optical compression techniques may paradoxically aggravate the long-context bottleneck. This study empirically defines DeepSeek-OCR's capability boundaries and offers essential insights for future optimizations of the vision-text compression paradigm.

Although early-exit strategies have proven effective in reducing computational demands by halting inference earlier, they apply either to only the first token in the generation phase or at the prompt level in the prefill phase. Thus, the Key-Value (KV) cache for skipped layers remains a bottleneck for subsequent token generation, limiting the benefits of early exit. We introduce ADEPT (Adaptive Dynamic Early-exit Process for Transformers), a novel approach designed to overcome this issue and enable dynamic early exit in both the prefill and generation phases. The proposed adaptive token-level early-exit mechanism adjusts computation dynamically based on token complexity, optimizing efficiency without compromising performance. ADEPT further enhances KV generation procedure by decoupling sequential dependencies in skipped layers, making token-level early exit more practical. Experimental results demonstrate that ADEPT improves efficiency by up to 25% in language generation tasks and achieves a 4x speed-up in downstream classification tasks, with up to a 45% improvement in performance.",

We systematically analyze this limitation, focusing on logical relationship understanding, which is a core capability underlying genuine logical reasoning, and reveal that errors related to this capability account for over 90\\% of incorrect predictions, with Chain-of-Thought Supervised Fine-Tuning (CoT-SFT) failing to substantially reduce these errors. To address this bottleneck, we propose First-Step Logical Reasoning (FSLR), a lightweight training framework targeting logical relationship understanding. Our key insight is that the first planning step-identifying which variables to use and which operation to apply-encourages the model to derive logical relationships directly from the problem statement. By training models on this isolated step, FSLR provides explicit supervision for logical relationship understanding, unlike CoT-SFT which implicitly embeds such relationships within complete solution trajectories. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets demonstrate that FSLR consistently outperforms CoT-SFT under both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings, with average improvements of 3.2\\% and 4.6\\%, respectively. Moreover, FSLR achieves 4-6x faster training and reduces training token consumption by over 80\\%.",

        "summary": "Modern information systems often involve different types of items, e.g., a text query, an image, a video clip, or an audio segment. This motivates omni-modal embedding models that map heterogeneous modalities into a shared space for direct comparison. However, most recent omni-modal embeddings still rely heavily on implicit alignment inherited from pretrained vision-language model (VLM) backbones. In practice, this causes three common issues: (i) similarity logits have modality-dependent sharpness, so scores are not on a consistent scale; (ii) in-batch negatives become less effective over time because mixed-modality batches create an imbalanced hardness distribution; as a result, many negatives quickly become trivial and contribute little gradient; and (iii) embeddings across modalities show mismatched first- and second-order statistics, which makes rankings less stable. To tackle these problems, we propose e5-omni, a lightweight explicit alignment recipe that adapts off-the-shelf VLMs into robust omni-modal embedding models. e5-omni combines three simple components: (1) modality-aware temperature calibration to align similarity scales, (2) a controllable negative curriculum with debiasing to focus on confusing negatives while reducing the impact of false negatives, and (3) batch whitening with covariance regularization to better match cross-modal geometry in the shared embedding space. Experiments on MMEB-V2 and AudioCaps show consistent gains over strong bi-modal and omni-modal baselines, and the same recipe also transfers well to other VLM backbones.

This significantly reduces not only the number of trainable parameters but also the total parameters computed during the forward pass, minimizing GPU memory consumption and accelerating the training process. (2) Layer Alignment, where the newly trained layers are reintegrated into the original model, followed by a brief full fine-tuning step on a small dataset to align the parameters. Experimental results demonstrate that the ELO method achieves a training speedup of up to 6.46 times compared to existing methods, while improving target language performance by up to 6.2\\% on qualitative benchmarks and effectively preserving source language (English) capabilities.",

While text-based affect inference has become increasingly feasible, prior approaches often treat sentiment as a deterministic point estimate for individual speakers, failing to capture the inherent subjectivity, latent ambiguity, and sequential coupling found in mutual exchanges. We introduce LLM-MC-Affect, a probabilistic framework that characterizes emotion not as a static label, but as a continuous latent probability distribution defined over an affective space. By leveraging stochastic LLM decoding and Monte Carlo estimation, the methodology approximates these distributions to derive high-fidelity sentiment trajectories that explicitly quantify both central affective tendencies and perceptual ambiguity. These trajectories enable a structured analysis of interpersonal coupling through sequential cross-correlation and slope-based indicators, identifying leading or lagging influences between interlocutors. To validate the interpretive capacity of this approach, we utilize teacher-student instructional dialogues as a representative case study, where our quantitative indicators successfully distill high-level interaction insights such as effective scaffolding.

However, enabling agents to continually learn new tasks without catastrophic forgetting remains a critical challenge, known as the stability-plasticity dilemma. In this work, we argue that this dilemma fundamentally arises from the failure to explicitly distinguish between common knowledge shared across tasks and conflicting knowledge introduced by task-specific interference. To address this, we propose Agent-Dice, a parameter fusion framework based on directional consensus evaluation. Concretely, Agent-Dice disentangles knowledge updates through a two-stage process: geometric consensus filtering to prune conflicting gradients, and curvature-based importance weighting to amplify shared semantics. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis that establishes the validity of the proposed fusion scheme and offers insight into the origins of the stability-plasticity dilemma. Extensive experiments on GUI agents and tool-use agent domains demonstrate that Agent-Dice exhibits outstanding continual learning performance with minimal computational overhead and parameter updates.",

LLMs are evaluated directly through HPI-diagnostic guideline comparison and indirectly through disease diagnosis. In our experiments, we observe that small open-source models fine-tuned with a well-curated, task-specific dataset can outperform frontier LLMs in pre-consultation. Additionally, we find that increased amount of HPI (History of Present Illness) does not necessarily lead to improved diagnostic performance. Further experiments reveal that the language of pre-consultation influences the characteristics of the dialogue. By open-sourcing our dataset and evaluation pipeline on https://github.com/seemdog/EPAG, we aim to contribute to the evaluation and further development of LLM applications in real-world clinical settings.",

        "summary": "Audio Language Models (ALMs) offer a promising shift towards explainable audio deepfake detections (ADDs), moving beyond \\textit{black-box} classifiers by providing some level of transparency into their predictions via reasoning traces. This necessitates a new class of model robustness analysis: robustness of the predictive reasoning under adversarial attacks, which goes beyond existing paradigm that mainly focuses on the shifts of the final predictions (e.g., fake v.s. real). To analyze such reasoning shifts, we introduce a forensic auditing framework to evaluate the robustness of ALMs' reasoning under adversarial attacks in three inter-connected dimensions: acoustic perception, cognitive coherence, and cognitive dissonance. Our systematic analysis reveals that explicit reasoning does not universally enhance robustness. Instead, we observe a bifurcation: for models exhibiting robust acoustic perception, reasoning acts as a defensive \\textit{``shield''}, protecting them from adversarial attacks. However, for others, it imposes a performance \\textit{``tax''}, particularly under linguistic attacks which reduce cognitive coherence and increase attack success rate. Crucially, even when classification fails, high cognitive dissonance can serve as a \\textit{silent alarm}, flagging potential manipulation. Overall, this work provides a critical evaluation of the role of reasoning in forensic audio deepfake analysis and its vulnerabilities.",

This limits its utility for applications such as fine-grained evaluation and preference optimization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Agentic Discriminative Verifier (DiVA), a hybrid framework that synergizes the agentic search capabilities of generative models with the precise scoring aptitude of discriminative models. We also construct a new benchmark, FGVeriBench, as a robust testbed for fine-grained factuality verification.

In contrast, real-world reasoning requires integrating multiple premises and solving subproblems in parallel. Existing methods, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), express reasoning in a linear textual form, which may appear coherent but frequently leads to inconsistent conclusions. Recent approaches rely on externally provided graphs and do not explore how LLMs can construct and use their own graph-structured reasoning, particularly in open-domain QA. To fill this gap, we novelly explore graph-structured reasoning of LLMs in general-domain question answering. We propose Self-Graph Reasoning (SGR), a framework that enables LLMs to explicitly represent their reasoning process as a structured graph before producing the final answer. We further construct a graph-structured reasoning dataset that merges multiple candidate reasoning graphs into refined graph structures for model training. Experiments on five QA benchmarks across both general and specialized domains show that SGR consistently improves reasoning consistency and yields a 17.74% gain over the base model. The LLaMA-3.3-70B model fine-tuned with SGR performs comparably to GPT-4o and surpasses Claude-3.5-Haiku, demonstrating the effectiveness of graph-structured reasoning.",

        "summary": "Code-switching, alternating between languages within a conversation, is natural for multilingual users, yet poses fundamental challenges for large language models (LLMs). When a user code-switches in their prompt to an LLM, they typically do not specify the expected language of the LLM response, and thus LLMs must infer the output language from contextual and pragmatic cues. We find that current LLMs systematically fail to align with this expectation, responding in undesired languages even when cues are clear to humans. We introduce OLA, a benchmark to evaluate LLMs' Output Language Alignment in code-switched interactions. OLA focuses on Korean--English code-switching and spans simple intra-sentential mixing to instruction-content mismatches. Even frontier models frequently misinterpret implicit language expectation, exhibiting a bias toward non-English responses. We further show this bias generalizes beyond Korean to Chinese and Indonesian pairs. Models also show instability through mid-response switching and language intrusions. Chain-of-Thought prompting fails to resolve these errors, indicating weak pragmatic reasoning about output language. However, Code-Switching Aware DPO with minimal data (about 1K examples) substantially reduces misalignment, suggesting these failures stem from insufficient alignment rather than fundamental limitations. Our results highlight the need to align multilingual LLMs with users' implicit expectations in real-world code-switched interactions.",

To address this gap, we move beyond refusal-centric metrics and introduce \\texttt{PsychEthicsBench}, the first principle-grounded benchmark based on Australian psychology and psychiatry guidelines, designed to evaluate LLMs' ethical knowledge and behavioral responses through multiple-choice and open-ended tasks with fine-grained ethicality annotations. Empirical results across 14 models reveal that refusal rates are poor indicators of ethical behavior, revealing a significant divergence between safety triggers and clinical appropriateness. Notably, we find that domain-specific fine-tuning can degrade ethical robustness, as several specialized models underperform their base backbones in ethical alignment.

We link these behavioral dynamics to LLMs' internal Concept Circuits, computational subgraphs associated with specific concepts, and incorporate Graph Metrics to characterize circuit structure. Our analysis reveals: (1) LLMs concept circuits provide a non-trivial, statistically significant signal of concept learning and forgetting; (2) Concept circuits exhibit a stage-wise temporal pattern during continual pretraining, with an early increase followed by gradual decrease and stabilization; (3) concepts with larger learning gains tend to exhibit greater forgetting under subsequent training; (4) semantically similar concepts induce stronger interference than weakly related ones; (5) conceptual knowledge differs in their transferability, with some significantly facilitating the learning of others. Together, our findings offer a circuit-level view of concept learning dynamics and inform the design of more interpretable and robust concept-aware training strategies for LLMs.",

We introduce a context-based assessment protocol that sequentially administers standardized questionnaires for privacy attitudes, prosocialness, and acceptance of data sharing within a bounded, history-carrying session. To evaluate value-action alignments under competing attitudes, we use multi-group structural equation modeling (MGSEM) to identify relations from privacy concerns and prosocialness to data sharing. We propose Value-Action Alignment Rate (VAAR), a human-referenced directional agreement metric that aggregates path-level evidence for expected signs.

We propose IntroLM, a method that enables causal language models to predict their own output quality during the prefilling phase without affecting generation using introspective tokens. By introducing token conditional LoRA that activates only for the introspective token, the model learns to predict the output quality for a given query while preserving the original backbone behavior and avoiding external evaluators. On question answering benchmarks, IntroLM applied to Qwen3 8B achieves a ROC AUC of 90 precent for success prediction, outperforming a DeBERTa classifier by 14 precent. When integrated into multi model routing systems, IntroLM achieves superior cost performance tradeoffs, reducing latency by up to 33 precent and large model usage by up to 50 precent at matched reliability.",

        "summary": "Recent large reasoning models (LRMs) have made substantial progress in complex reasoning tasks, yet they often generate lengthy reasoning paths for every query, incurring unnecessary computation and latency. Existing speed-up approaches typically rely on retraining the model or designing sophisticated prompting, which are either prohibitively expensive or highly sensitive to the input and prompt formulation. In this work, we study model merging as a lightweight alternative for efficient reasoning: by combining a long chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) reasoning model with a Short-CoT instruction model, we obtain an adaptive reasoner without training from scratch or requiring large-scale additional data. Building on this idea, we propose Reasoning Pattern Alignment Merging (RPAM), a layer-wise model merging framework based on feature alignment to facilitate query-adaptive reasoning. RPAM first constructs a small pattern-labeled calibration set that assigns each query an appropriate reasoning pattern. It then optimizes layer-wise merging coefficients by aligning the merged model's intermediate representations with those of the selected model, while a contrastive objective explicitly pushes them away from the non-selected model. Experiments on seven widely used reasoning benchmarks show that RPAM substantially reduces inference cost while maintaining strong performance. Upon article acceptance, we will provide open-source code to reproduce experiments for RPAM.",

CALM disentangles task semantics from explicit cultural concepts and latent cultural signals, shaping them into structured cultural clusters through contrastive learning. These clusters are then aligned via cross-attention to establish fine-grained interactions among related cultural features and are adaptively integrated through a Mixture-of-Experts mechanism along culture-specific dimensions. The resulting unified representation is fused with the model's original knowledge to construct a culturally grounded internal identity state, which is further enhanced through self-prompted reflective learning, enabling continual adaptation and self-correction.

Based on Moral Foundations Theory, SMRA aligns token-level attention with expert-annotated moral rationales, guiding models to attend to morally salient spans rather than spurious lexical patterns. Unlike prior rationale-supervised or post-hoc approaches, SMRA integrates moral rationale supervision directly into the training objective, producing inherently interpretable and contextualized explanations. To support our framework, we also introduce HateBRMoralXplain, a Brazilian Portuguese benchmark dataset annotated with hate labels, moral categories, token-level moral rationales, and socio-political metadata. Across binary hate speech detection and multi-label moral sentiment classification, SMRA consistently improves performance (e.g., +0.9 and +1.5 F1, respectively) while substantially enhancing explanation faithfulness, increasing IoU F1 (+7.4 pp) and Token F1 (+5.0 pp).

        "summary": "Linear text segmentation is a long-standing problem in natural language processing (NLP), focused on dividing continuous text into coherent and semantically meaningful units. Despite its importance, the task remains challenging due to the complexity of defining topic boundaries, the variability in discourse structure, and the need to balance local coherence with global context. These difficulties hinder downstream applications such as summarization, information retrieval, and question answering. In this work, we introduce SegNSP, framing linear text segmentation as a next sentence prediction (NSP) task. Although NSP has largely been abandoned in modern pre-training, its explicit modeling of sentence-to-sentence continuity makes it a natural fit for detecting topic boundaries. We propose a label-agnostic NSP approach, which predicts whether the next sentence continues the current topic without requiring explicit topic labels, and enhance it with a segmentation-aware loss combined with harder negative sampling to better capture discourse continuity. Unlike recent proposals that leverage NSP alongside auxiliary topic classification, our approach avoids task-specific supervision. We evaluate our model against established baselines on two datasets, CitiLink-Minutes, for which we establish the first segmentation benchmark, and WikiSection. On CitiLink-Minutes, SegNSP achieves a B-$F_1$ of 0.79, closely aligning with human-annotated topic transitions, while on WikiSection it attains a B-F$_1$ of 0.65, outperforming the strongest reproducible baseline, TopSeg, by 0.17 absolute points. These results demonstrate competitive and robust performance, highlighting the effectiveness of modeling sentence-to-sentence continuity for improving segmentation quality and supporting downstream NLP applications.",

The subsets respectively evaluate text-grounded factual recall, multi-step inference linking document evidence with epidemiological principles, and conclusion reconstruction with the Discussion section withheld. Construction combines expert-designed taxonomy guidance, multi-model verification, and retrieval-based difficulty control. Experiments on ten open models reveal that current LLMs show limited performance on epidemiological reasoning, with multi-step inference posing the greatest challenge. Model rankings shift across subsets, and scale alone does not predict success. Chain-of-Thought prompting benefits multi-step inference but yields mixed results elsewhere.

While zero-shot prompting performs near chance, linear probes improve average F1 from 0.15-0.26 to 0.61-0.67, often matching or exceeding specialized time series models. Layer-wise analyses further show that class-discriminative time series information emerges in early transformer layers and is amplified by visual and multimodal inputs.

Using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) to measure absolute agreement, we find that LLM judgments are not perfectly consistent across scales on subjective benchmarks, and that the choice of scale substantially shifts human-LLM agreement, even when within-group panel reliability is high. Aggregated over tasks, the grading scale of 0-5 yields the strongest human-LLM alignment.

Next, we conducted a large-scale meta-evaluation using 16 smaller open-source LLMs and 9 embedding models with a focus on making ASPECTSIM accessible and reproducible. While directly prompting LLMs to produce ASPECTSIM scores turned out be ineffective (20-30% human-machine agreement), a simple two-stage refinement improved their agreement by $\\approx$140%.

We propose LatentGraphMem, a memory framework that combines implicit graph memory with explicit subgraph retrieval. LatentGraphMem stores a graph-structured memory in latent space for stability and efficiency, and exposes a task-specific subgraph retrieval interface that returns a compact symbolic subgraph under a fixed budget for downstream reasoning and human inspection. During training, an explicit graph view is materialized to interface with a frozen reasoner for question-answering supervision. At inference time, retrieval is performed in latent space and only the retrieved subgraph is externalized. Experiments on long-horizon benchmarks across multiple model scales show that LatentGraphMem consistently outperforms representative explicit-graph and latent-memory baselines, while enabling parameter-efficient adaptation and flexible scaling to larger reasoners without introducing large symbolic artifacts.",

Consequently, models trained on such data exhibit substantial and systematic performance degradation compared to standard fine-tuning.

We identify two alignment-induced biases in existing methods: a positive moral bias, where characters uniformly adopt agreeable stances (e.g. always saying lying is bad), and a helpful assistant bias, where characters invariably answer questions directly (e.g. never refusing or deflecting). While such tendencies suit instruction-following systems, they suppress dramatic tension and yield predictable characters, stemming from maximum likelihood training and assistant fine-tuning. To address this, we introduce PersonaWeaver, a framework that disentangles world-building (roles, demographics) from behavioral-building (moral stances, interactional styles), yielding characters with more diverse reactions and moral stances, as well as second-order diversity in stylistic markers like length, tone, and punctuation.

In this work, we investigate the problem in the scope of the emergent misalignment problem where LLMs can generalize patterns learned from misaligned content in one domain to another domain. We discover a strong causal relationship between metaphors in training data and the misalignment degree of LLMs' reasoning contents. With interventions using metaphors in pre-training, fine-tuning and re-alignment phases, models' cross-domain misalignment degrees change significantly. As we delve deeper into the causes behind this phenomenon, we observe that there is a connection between metaphors and the activation of global and local latent features of large reasoning models. By monitoring these latent features, we design a detector that predict misaligned content with high accuracy.",

        "summary": "Natural languages exhibit striking regularities in their statistical structure, including notably the emergence of Zipf's and Heaps' laws. Despite this, it remains broadly unclear how these properties relate to the modern tokenisation schemes used in contemporary transformer models. In this note, we analyse the information content (as measured by the Shannon entropy) of various corpora under the assumption of a Zipfian frequency distribution, and derive a closed-form expression for the slot entropy expectation value. We then empirically investigate how byte--pair encoding (BPE) transforms corpus statistics, showing that recursive applications of BPE drive token frequencies toward a Zipfian power law while inducing a characteristic growth pattern in empirical entropy. Utilizing the ability of transformers to learn context dependent token probability distributions, we train language models on corpora tokenised at varying BPE depths, revealing that the model predictive entropies increasingly agree with Zipf-derived predictions as the BPE depth increases. Attention-based diagnostics further indicate that deeper tokenisation reduces local token dependencies, bringing the empirical distribution closer to the weakly dependent (near IID) regime. Together, these results clarify how BPE acts not only as a compression mechanism but also as a statistical transform that reconstructs key informational properties of natural language.",

        "summary": "The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is fundamentally constrained by the \"Memory Wall\" the bottleneck where data movement latency outstrips arithmetic throughput. Standard inference runtimes often incur significant overhead through high-level abstractions, dynamic dispatch, and unaligned memory access patterns. In this work, we present a novel \"Virtual Tensor Core\" architecture implemented in software, optimized specifically for ARM64 microarchitectures (Apple Silicon). By bypassing standard library containers in favor of direct memory mapping (mmap) and implementing hand-tuned NEON SIMD kernels, we achieve a form of \"Software-Defined Direct Memory Access (DMA).\" Our proposed Tensor Virtualization Layout (TVL) guarantees 100% cache line utilization for weight matrices, while our zero-copy loader eliminates initialization latency. Experimental results on a 110M parameter model demonstrate a stable throughput of >60 tokens/second on M2 hardware. While proprietary hardware accelerators (e.g., Apple AMX) can achieve higher peak throughput, our architecture provides a fully open, portable, and deterministic reference implementation for studying the memory bottleneck on general-purpose ARM silicon, meeting the 200ms psycholinguistic latency threshold without opaque dependencies.",

        "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) become deeply embedded in daily life, the urgent need for safer moderation systems, distinguishing between naive from harmful requests while upholding appropriate censorship boundaries, has never been greater. While existing LLMs can detect harmful or unsafe content, they often struggle with nuanced cases such as implicit offensiveness, subtle gender and racial biases, and jailbreak prompts, due to the subjective and context-dependent nature of these issues. Furthermore, their heavy reliance on training data can reinforce societal biases, resulting in inconsistent and ethically problematic outputs. To address these challenges, we introduce GuardEval, a unified multi-perspective benchmark dataset designed for both training and evaluation, containing 106 fine-grained categories spanning human emotions, offensive and hateful language, gender and racial bias, and broader safety concerns. We also present GemmaGuard (GGuard), a QLoRA fine-tuned version of Gemma3-12B trained on GuardEval, to assess content moderation with fine-grained labels. Our evaluation shows that GGuard achieves a macro F1 score of 0.832, substantially outperforming leading moderation models, including OpenAI Moderator (0.64) and Llama Guard (0.61). We show that multi-perspective, human-centered safety benchmarks are critical for reducing biased and inconsistent moderation decisions. GuardEval and GGuard together demonstrate that diverse, representative data materially improve safety, fairness, and robustness on complex, borderline cases.",

        "summary": "The versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in vertical domains has spurred the development of numerous specialized evaluation benchmarks. However, these benchmarks often suffer from significant semantic redundancy and impose high computational costs during evaluation. Existing compression methods, such as tinyBenchmarks depend critically on correctness labels from multiple historical models evaluated on the full test set, making them inapplicable in cold-start scenarios, such as the introduction of a new task, domain, or model with no prior evaluation history. To address this limitation, we propose a history-free test set compression framework that requires no prior model performance data. Our method begins by fine-tuning a base LLM on a small amount of domain-specific data to internalize task-relevant semantics. It then generates high-level semantic embeddings for all original test samples using only their raw textual content. In this domain-adapted embedding space, we perform task-aware clustering and introduce a novel dataset X-ray mechanism that analyzes cluster geometry to dynamically calibrate the compression intensity based on the intrinsic redundancy of the benchmark. Experiments on professional-domain dataset, notably a large-scale 3GPP communications benchmark, demonstrate that our approach effectively identifies and removes redundant samples, reducing evaluation cost by over 90% while preserving high fidelity to the full benchmark.",

        "summary": "This is the system card published alongside the OpenAI GPT-5 launch, August 2025. GPT-5 is a unified system with a smart and fast model that answers most questions, a deeper reasoning model for harder problems, and a real-time router that quickly decides which model to use based on conversation type, complexity, tool needs, and explicit intent (for example, if you say 'think hard about this' in the prompt). The router is continuously trained on real signals, including when users switch models, preference rates for responses, and measured correctness, improving over time. Once usage limits are reached, a mini version of each model handles remaining queries. This system card focuses primarily on gpt-5-thinking and gpt-5-main, while evaluations for other models are available in the appendix. The GPT-5 system not only outperforms previous models on benchmarks and answers questions more quickly, but -- more importantly -- is more useful for real-world queries. We've made significant advances in reducing hallucinations, improving instruction following, and minimizing sycophancy, and have leveled up GPT-5's performance in three of ChatGPT's most common uses: writing, coding, and health. All of the GPT-5 models additionally feature safe-completions, our latest approach to safety training to prevent disallowed content. Similarly to ChatGPT agent, we have decided to treat gpt-5-thinking as High capability in the Biological and Chemical domain under our Preparedness Framework, activating the associated safeguards. While we do not have definitive evidence that this model could meaningfully help a novice to create severe biological harm -- our defined threshold for High capability -- we have chosen to take a precautionary approach.",

Open-source alternatives allow local inference but often require large model sizes that limit their use in resource-constrained clinical settings. Here, we benchmark two on-device LLMs, gpt-oss-20b and gpt-oss-120b, across three representative clinical tasks: general disease diagnosis, specialty-specific (ophthalmology) diagnosis and management, and simulation of human expert grading and evaluation. We compare their performance with state-of-the-art proprietary models (GPT-5 and o4-mini) and a leading open-source model (DeepSeek-R1), and we further evaluate the adaptability of on-device systems by fine-tuning gpt-oss-20b on general diagnostic data. Across tasks, gpt-oss models achieve performance comparable to or exceeding DeepSeek-R1 and o4-mini despite being substantially smaller. In addition, fine-tuning remarkably improves the diagnostic accuracy of gpt-oss-20b, enabling it to approach the performance of GPT-5. These findings highlight the potential of on-device LLMs to deliver accurate, adaptable, and privacy-preserving clinical decision support, offering a practical pathway for broader integration of LLMs into routine clinical practice.",

        "summary": "This paper introduces Jailbreak-Zero, a novel red teaming methodology that shifts the paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM) safety evaluation from a constrained example-based approach to a more expansive and effective policy-based framework. By leveraging an attack LLM to generate a high volume of diverse adversarial prompts and then fine-tuning this attack model with a preference dataset, Jailbreak-Zero achieves Pareto optimality across the crucial objectives of policy coverage, attack strategy diversity, and prompt fidelity to real user inputs. The empirical evidence demonstrates the superiority of this method, showcasing significantly higher attack success rates against both open-source and proprietary models like GPT-40 and Claude 3.5 when compared to existing state-of-the-art techniques. Crucially, Jailbreak-Zero accomplishes this while producing human-readable and effective adversarial prompts with minimal need for human intervention, thereby presenting a more scalable and comprehensive solution for identifying and mitigating the safety vulnerabilities of LLMs.",

Using CAP-GSM8K (N=500), an adversarial dataset, we evaluate internal (CoT) versus external (RCA) mechanisms across GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5.1. Our results reveal the structural limits of internal reasoning: it causes performance collapse in weak models (the Prioritization Paradox) and leaves an 11.4\\% final output gap in frontier models. In contrast, RCA structurally eliminates sycophancy (0.0\\%) across all tiers. We synthesize these findings into a thermodynamic hierarchy: hybrid systems achieve Resonance (optimal efficiency) only when capabilities are matched and strong, while weak or mismatched pairs succumb to Dissonance and Entropy. This confirms that external structural constraints are strictly necessary to guarantee safety.",

To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history.

To address this, we propose \\textbf{Residual Semantic Steering (RSS)}, a probabilistic framework that disentangles physical affordance from semantic execution. RSS introduces two theoretical innovations: (1) \\textbf{Monte Carlo Syntactic Integration}, which approximates the true semantic posterior via dense, LLM-driven distributional expansion, and (2) \\textbf{Residual Affordance Steering}, a dual-stream decoding mechanism that explicitly isolates the causal influence of language by subtracting the visual affordance prior.

In an effort to complement the ingrained \"knowledge\" of LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have become widely popular. At its core, RAG involves the coupling of LLMs with domain-specific knowledge bases, whereby the generation of a response to a user question is augmented with contextual and up-to-date information. The proliferation of RAG has sparked concerns about data privacy, particularly with the inherent risks that arise when leveraging databases with potentially sensitive information. Numerous recent works have explored various aspects of privacy risks in RAG systems, from adversarial attacks to proposed mitigations. With the goal of surveying and unifying these works, we ask one simple question: What are the privacy risks in RAG, and how can they be measured and mitigated? To answer this question, we conduct a systematic literature review of RAG works addressing privacy, and we systematize our findings into a comprehensive set of privacy risks, mitigation techniques, and evaluation strategies. We supplement these findings with two primary artifacts: a Taxonomy of RAG Privacy Risks and a RAG Privacy Process Diagram. Our work contributes to the study of privacy in RAG not only by conducting the first systematization of risks and mitigations, but also by uncovering important considerations when mitigating privacy risks in RAG systems and assessing the current maturity of proposed mitigations.",

However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.",

Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.",

Generative world models offer a promising remedy: agents could use them as external simulators to foresee outcomes before acting. This paper empirically examines whether current agents can leverage such world models as tools to enhance their cognition. Across diverse agentic and visual question answering tasks, we observe that some agents rarely invoke simulation (fewer than 1%), frequently misuse predicted rollouts (approximately 15%), and often exhibit inconsistent or even degraded performance (up to 5%) when simulation is available or enforced. Attribution analysis further indicates that the primary bottleneck lies in the agents' capacity to decide when to simulate, how to interpret predicted outcomes, and how to integrate foresight into downstream reasoning. These findings underscore the need for mechanisms that foster calibrated, strategic interaction with world models, paving the way toward more reliable anticipatory cognition in future agent systems.",

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.",

Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\\% in control effectiveness.

Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

        "summary": "Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \\textbf{STAR-S} (\\textbf{S}elf-\\textbf{TA}ught \\textbf{R}easoning based on \\textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.",

        "summary": "Tasks in the aerospace industry heavily rely on searching and reusing large volumes of technical documents, yet there is no public information retrieval (IR) benchmark that reflects the terminology- and query-intent characteristics of this domain. To address this gap, this paper proposes the STELLA (Self-Reflective TErminoLogy-Aware Framework for BuiLding an Aerospace Information Retrieval Benchmark) framework. Using this framework, we introduce the STELLA benchmark, an aerospace-specific IR evaluation set constructed from NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) documents via a systematic pipeline that comprises document layout detection, passage chunking, terminology dictionary construction, synthetic query generation, and cross-lingual extension. The framework generates two types of queries: the Terminology Concordant Query (TCQ), which includes the terminology verbatim to evaluate lexical matching, and the Terminology Agnostic Query (TAQ), which utilizes the terminology's description to assess semantic matching. This enables a disentangled evaluation of the lexical and semantic matching capabilities of embedding models. In addition, we combine Chain-of-Density (CoD) and the Self-Reflection method with query generation to improve quality and implement a hybrid cross-lingual extension that reflects real user querying practices. Evaluation of seven embedding models on the STELLA benchmark shows that large decoder-based embedding models exhibit the strongest semantic understanding, while lexical matching methods such as BM25 remain highly competitive in domains where exact lexical matching technical term is crucial. The STELLA benchmark provides a reproducible foundation for reliable performance evaluation and improvement of embedding models in aerospace-domain IR tasks.

        "summary": "Students from different socioeconomic backgrounds exhibit persistent gaps in test scores, gaps that can translate into unequal educational and labor-market outcomes later in life. In many assessments, performance reflects not only what students know, but also how effectively they can communicate that knowledge. This distinction is especially salient in writing assessments, where scores jointly reward the substance of students' ideas and the way those ideas are expressed. As a result, observed score gaps may conflate differences in underlying content with differences in expressive skill. A central question, therefore, is how much of the socioeconomic-status (SES) gap in scores is driven by differences in what students say versus how they say it. We study this question using a large corpus of persuasive essays written by U.S. middle- and high-school students. We introduce a new measurement strategy that separates content from style by leveraging large language models to generate multiple stylistic variants of each essay. These rewrites preserve the underlying arguments while systematically altering surface expression, creating a \"generated panel\" that introduces controlled within-essay variation in style. This approach allows us to decompose SES gaps in writing scores into contributions from content and style. We find an SES gap of 0.67 points on a 1-6 scale. Approximately 69% of the gap is attributable to differences in essay content quality, Style differences account for 26% of the gap, and differences in evaluation standards across SES groups account for the remaining 5%. These patterns seems stable across demographic subgroups and writing tasks. More broadly, our approach shows how large language models can be used to generate controlled variation in observational data, enabling researchers to isolate and quantify the contributions of otherwise entangled factors.",

Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation. We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $Δλ_2 \\approx -0.76$. We term this scar \\textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\\approx 38\\%$ of lost information flow. Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.",

To address this problem, we propose FJAR, a fine-grained jailbreak evaluation framework with anchored references. We first categorized jailbreak responses into five fine-grained categories: Rejective, Irrelevant, Unhelpful, Incorrect, and Successful, based on the degree to which the response addresses the malicious intent of the query. This categorization serves as the basis for FJAR. Then, we introduce a novel harmless tree decomposition approach to construct high-quality anchored references by breaking down the original queries. These references guide the evaluator in determining whether the response genuinely fulfills the original query. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FJAR achieves the highest alignment with human judgment and effectively identifies the root causes of jailbreak failures, providing actionable guidance for improving attack strategies.",

Existing retrieval agents mainly focus on the content-level similarities and are unable to decode critical relational dynamics, such as identifying corroborating or conflicting studies or tracing technological lineages, all of which are essential for a comprehensive literature review. Consequently, this fundamental limitation often results in a fragmented knowledge structure, misleading sentiment interpretation, and inadequate modeling of collective scientific progress. To investigate relation-aware retrieval more deeply, we propose SciNetBench, the first Scientific Network Relation-aware Benchmark for literature retrieval agents. Constructed from a corpus of over 18 million AI papers, our benchmark systematically evaluates three levels of relations: ego-centric retrieval of papers with novel knowledge structures, pair-wise identification of scholarly relationships, and path-wise reconstruction of scientific evolutionary trajectories. Through extensive evaluation of three categories of retrieval agents, we find that their accuracy on relation-aware retrieval tasks often falls below 20%, revealing a core shortcoming of current retrieval paradigms. Notably, further experiments on the literature review tasks demonstrate that providing agents with relational ground truth leads to a substantial 23.4% performance improvement in the review quality, validating the critical importance of relation-aware retrieval. We publicly release our benchmark at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SciNetBench/ to support future research on advanced retrieval systems.",

This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies). We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements. We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.",

However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks.

This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model.

Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their \"black-box\" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation. In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.",

However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification. Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques. In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations. We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.",

During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the \"supportedness\" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable.

Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.",

Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates.

We focus on Agentic Communities - coordination frameworks encompassing LLM Agents, Agentic AI entities, and humans - most relevant for enterprise and industrial applications. Drawing on established coordination principles from distributed systems, we ground these patterns in a formal framework that specifies collaboration agreements where AI agents and humans fill roles within governed ecosystems. This approach provides both practical guidance and formal verification capabilities, enabling expression of organizational, legal, and ethical rules through accountability mechanisms that ensure operational and verifiable governance of inter-agent communication, negotiation, and intent modeling. We validate this framework through a clinical trial matching case study.

We argue that protein function prediction is a knowledge-intensive scientific task that fundamentally relies on external biological priors and computational tools rather than purely internal reasoning. To address this gap, we propose PFUA, a tool-augmented protein reasoning agent that unifies problem decomposition, tool invocation, and grounded answer generation. Instead of relying on long unconstrained reasoning traces, PFUA integrates domain-specific tools to produce verifiable intermediate evidence. Experiments on four benchmarks demonstrate that PFUA consistently outperforms text-only reasoning models with an average performance improvement of 103%.",

While process-level reward models offer a promising direction, existing LLM-based judges often produce noisy and inconsistent signals because they lack fine-grained, task-specific rubrics to distinguish high-level planning from low-level execution. In this work, we introduce SCRIBE (Skill-Conditioned Reward with Intermediate Behavioral Evaluation), a reinforcement learning framework that intervenes at a novel mid-level abstraction. SCRIBE grounds reward modeling in a curated library of skill prototypes, transforming open-ended LLM evaluation into a constrained verification problem. By routing each subgoal to a corresponding prototype, the reward model is equipped with precise, structured rubrics that substantially reduce reward variance. Experimental results show that SCRIBE achieves state-of-the-art performance across a range of reasoning and tool-use benchmarks. In particular, it improves the AIME25 accuracy of a Qwen3-4B model from 43.3% to 63.3%, and significantly increases success rates in complex multi-turn tool interactions. Further analysis of training dynamics reveals a co-evolution across abstraction levels, where mastery of mid-level skills consistently precedes the emergence of effective high-level planning behaviors. Finally, we demonstrate that SCRIBE is additive to low-level tool optimizations, providing a scalable and complementary pathway toward more autonomous and reliable tool-using agents.",

        "summary": "One of the most important queries in knowledge compilation is weighted model counting (WMC), which has been applied to probabilistic inference on various models, such as Bayesian networks. In practical situations on inference tasks, the model's parameters have uncertainty because they are often learned from data, and thus we want to compute the degree of uncertainty in the inference outcome. One possible approach is to regard the inference outcome as a random variable by introducing distributions for the parameters and evaluate the variance of the outcome. Unfortunately, the tractability of computing such a variance is hardly known. Motivated by this, we consider the problem of computing the variance of WMC and investigate this problem's tractability. First, we derive a polynomial time algorithm to evaluate the WMC variance when the input is given as a structured d-DNNF. Second, we prove the hardness of this problem for structured DNNFs, d-DNNFs, and FBDDs, which is intriguing because the latter two allow polynomial time WMC algorithms. Finally, we show an application that measures the uncertainty in the inference of Bayesian networks.

        "summary": "Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.",

Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks. The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling.

Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to evolve solutions to problems in many domains, in a process inspired by biological evolution. However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called \"Red Queen\" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.",

The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data.

Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.",

        "summary": "As world models gain momentum in Embodied AI, an increasing number of works explore using video foundation models as predictive world models for downstream embodied tasks like 3D prediction or interactive generation. However, before exploring these downstream tasks, video foundation models still have two critical questions unanswered: (1) whether their generative generalization is sufficient to maintain perceptual fidelity in the eyes of human observers, and (2) whether they are robust enough to serve as a universal prior for real-world embodied agents. To provide a standardized framework for answering these questions, we introduce the Embodied Turing Test benchmark: WoW-World-Eval (Wow,wo,val). Building upon 609 robot manipulation data, Wow-wo-val examines five core abilities, including perception, planning, prediction, generalization, and execution. We propose a comprehensive evaluation protocol with 22 metrics to assess the models' generation ability, which achieves a high Pearson Correlation between the overall score and human preference (>0.93) and establishes a reliable foundation for the Human Turing Test. On Wow-wo-val, models achieve only 17.27 on long-horizon planning and at best 68.02 on physical consistency, indicating limited spatiotemporal consistency and physical reasoning. For the Inverse Dynamic Model Turing Test, we first use an IDM to evaluate the video foundation models' execution accuracy in the real world. However, most models collapse to $\\approx$ 0% success, while WoW maintains a 40.74% success rate. These findings point to a noticeable gap between the generated videos and the real world, highlighting the urgency and necessity of benchmarking World Model in Embodied AI.",

However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

While modular frameworks enable users to automatically generate and configure algorithms tailored to specific optimization problems, the complexity of this process increases with the number of modules in the framework and the degrees of freedom defined for their interaction. Understanding how modules affect the performance of algorithms for different problems is critical to making the process of finding effective implementations more efficient and identifying promising areas for further investigation. Despite their practical applications and scientific relevance, there is a lack of empirical studies investigating which modules matter most in modular optimization frameworks and how they interact. In this paper, we analyze the performance of 1424 particle swarm optimization algorithms instantiated from the PSO-X framework on the 25 functions in the CEC'05 benchmark suite with 10 and 30 dimensions. We use functional ANOVA to quantify the impact of modules and their combinations on performance in different problem classes. In practice, this allows us to identify which modules have greater influence on PSO-X performance depending on problem features such as multimodality, mathematical transformations and varying dimensionality. We then perform a cluster analysis to identify groups of problem classes that share similar module effect patterns. Our results show low variability in the importance of modules in all problem classes, suggesting that particle swarm optimization performance is driven by a few influential modules.",

We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.",

To address this critical challenge, we propose HoneyTrap, a novel deceptive LLM defense framework leveraging collaborative defenders to counter jailbreak attacks. It integrates four defensive agents, Threat Interceptor, Misdirection Controller, Forensic Tracker, and System Harmonizer, each performing a specialized security role and collaborating to complete a deceptive defense. To ensure a comprehensive evaluation, we introduce MTJ-Pro, a challenging multi-turn progressive jailbreak dataset that combines seven advanced jailbreak strategies designed to gradually deepen attack strategies across multi-turn attacks. Besides, we present two novel metrics: Mislead Success Rate (MSR) and Attack Resource Consumption (ARC), which provide more nuanced assessments of deceptive defense beyond conventional measures. Experimental results on GPT-4, GPT-3.5-turbo, Gemini-1.5-pro, and LLaMa-3.1 demonstrate that HoneyTrap achieves an average reduction of 68.77% in attack success rates compared to state-of-the-art baselines. Notably, even in a dedicated adaptive attacker setting with intensified conditions, HoneyTrap remains resilient, leveraging deceptive engagement to prolong interactions, significantly increasing the time and computational costs required for successful exploitation.

        "summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models facilitate edge deployment by decoupling model capacity from active computation, yet their large memory footprint drives the need for GPU systems with near-data processing (NDP) capabilities that offload experts to dedicated processing units. However, deploying MoE models on such edge-based GPU-NDP systems faces three critical challenges: 1) severe load imbalance across NDP units due to non-uniform expert selection and expert parallelism, 2) insufficient GPU utilization during expert computation within NDP units, and 3) extensive data pre-profiling necessitated by unpredictable expert activation patterns for pre-fetching. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an efficient inference framework featuring three key optimizations. First, the underexplored tensor parallelism in MoE inference is exploited to partition and compute large expert parameters across multiple NDP units simultaneously towards edge low-batch scenarios. Second, a load-balancing-aware scheduling algorithm distributes expert computations across NDP units and GPU to maximize resource utilization. Third, a dataset-free pre-fetching strategy proactively loads frequently accessed experts to minimize activation delays. Experimental results show that our framework enables GPU-NDP systems to achieve 2.41x on average and up to 2.56x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to state-of-the-art approaches, significantly enhancing MoE inference efficiency in resource-constrained environments.",

Decision trees induce rule-based, axis-aligned decision regions (finite unions of boxes), whereas shallow ReLU networks are typically trained as score models whose predictions are obtained by thresholding. We analyze the infinite-width, bounded-norm, single-hidden-layer ReLU class through the Radon total variation ($\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$) seminorm, which controls the geometric complexity of level sets. We first show that the hard tree indicator $1_A$ has infinite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$. Moreover, two natural split-wise continuous surrogates--piecewise-linear ramp smoothing and sigmoidal (logistic) smoothing--also have infinite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ in dimensions $d>1$, while Gaussian convolution yields finite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ but with an explicit exponential dependence on $d$. We then separate two goals that are often conflated: classification after thresholding (recovering the decision set) versus score learning (learning a calibrated score close to $1_A$). For classification, we construct a smooth barrier score $S_A$ with finite $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ whose fixed threshold $τ=1$ exactly recovers the box. Under a mild tube-mass condition near $\\partial A$, we prove an $L_1(P)$ calibration bound that decays polynomially in a sharpness parameter, along with an explicit $\\mathrm{R}\\mathrm{TV}$ upper bound in terms of face measures. Experiments on synthetic unions of rectangles illustrate the resulting accuracy--complexity tradeoff and how threshold selection shifts where training lands along it.",

        "summary": "Geometric and Topological Deep Learning are rapidly growing research areas that enhance machine learning through the use of geometric and topological structures. Within this framework, Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) have emerged as a powerful class of operators for encoding symmetries and designing efficient, interpretable neural architectures. Originally introduced in Topological Data Analysis, GENEOs have since found applications in Deep Learning as tools for constructing equivariant models with reduced parameter complexity. GENEOs provide a unifying framework bridging Geometric and Topological Deep Learning and include the operator computing persistence diagrams as a special case. Their theoretical foundations rely on group actions, equivariance, and compactness properties of operator spaces, grounding them in algebra and geometry while enabling both mathematical rigor and practical relevance. While a previous representation theorem characterized linear GENEOs acting on data of the same type, many real-world applications require operators between heterogeneous data spaces. In this work, we address this limitation by introducing a new representation theorem for linear GENEOs acting between different perception pairs, based on generalized T-permutant measures. Under mild assumptions on the data domains and group actions, our result provides a complete characterization of such operators. We also prove the compactness and convexity of the space of linear GENEOs. We further demonstrate the practical impact of this theory by applying the proposed framework to improve the performance of autoencoders, highlighting the relevance of GENEOs in modern machine learning applications.",

This reduces model capacity and causes catastrophic interference during adaptation. We propose the Spectrally-Regularized Mixture of Experts (SR-MoE), which imposes geometric constraints on the routing manifold to enforce structural modularity. Our method uses dual regularization: spectral norm constraints bound routing function Lipschitz continuity, while stable rank penalties preserve high-dimensional feature diversity in expert selection. We evaluate SR-MoE across architectural scales and dataset complexities using modular one-shot adaptation tasks. Results show that traditional linear gating fails with increasing depth (accuracy drops up to 4.72% due to expert entanglement), while SR-MoE maintains structural integrity (mean interference -0.32%). Our spectral constraints facilitate positive knowledge transfer, enabling localized expert updates without global performance decay. SR-MoE provides a general solution for building high-capacity, modular networks capable of stable lifelong learning.",

Building upon this, we present IndexTTS 2.5, which significantly enhances multilingual coverage, inference speed, and overall synthesis quality through four key improvements: 1) Semantic Codec Compression: we reduce the semantic codec frame rate from 50 Hz to 25 Hz, halving sequence length and substantially lowering both training and inference costs; 2) Architectural Upgrade: we replace the U-DiT-based backbone of the S2M module with a more efficient Zipformer-based modeling architecture, achieving notable parameter reduction and faster mel-spectrogram generation; 3) Multilingual Extension: We propose three explicit cross-lingual modeling strategies, boundary-aware alignment, token-level concatenation, and instruction-guided generation, establishing practical design principles for zero-shot multilingual emotional TTS that supports Chinese, English, Japanese, and Spanish, and enables robust emotion transfer even without target-language emotional training data; 4) Reinforcement Learning Optimization: we apply GRPO in post-training of the T2S module, improving pronunciation accuracy and natrualness. Experiments show that IndexTTS 2.5 not only supports broader language coverage but also replicates emotional prosody in unseen languages under the same zero-shot setting. IndexTTS 2.5 achieves a 2.28 times improvement in RTF while maintaining comparable WER and speaker similarity to IndexTTS 2.",

Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical \"Full Damage\" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery.

Using nationally representative UK survey data from 2023 to 2024, we show that women adopt GenAI substantially less often than men because they perceive its societal risks differently. We construct a composite index capturing concerns about mental health, privacy, climate impact, and labor market disruption. This index explains between 9 and 18 percent of the variation in GenAI adoption and ranks among the strongest predictors for women across all age groups, surpassing digital literacy and education for young women. Intersectional analyses show that the largest disparities arise among younger, digitally fluent individuals with high societal risk concerns, where gender gaps in personal use exceed 45 percentage points. Using a synthetic twin panel design, we show that increased optimism about AI's societal impact raises GenAI use among young women from 13 percent to 33 percent, substantially narrowing the gender divide. These findings indicate that gendered perceptions of AI's social and ethical consequences, rather than access or capability, are the primary drivers of unequal GenAI adoption, with implications for productivity, skill formation, and economic inequality in an AI enabled economy.",

        "summary": "The logical semantics of normal logic programs has traditionally been based on the notions of Clark's completion and two-valued or three-valued canonical models, including supported, stable, regular, and well-founded models. Two-valued interpretations can also be seen as states evolving under a program's update operator, producing a transition graph whose fixed points and cycles capture stable and oscillatory behaviors, respectively. We refer to this view as dynamical semantics since it characterizes the program's meaning in terms of state-space trajectories, as first introduced in the stable (supported) class semantics. Recently, we have established a formal connection between Datalog^\\neg programs (i.e., normal logic programs without function symbols) and Boolean networks, leading to the introduction of the trap space concept for Datalog^\\neg programs. In this paper, we generalize the trap space concept to arbitrary normal logic programs, introducing trap space semantics as a new approach to their interpretation. This new semantics admits both model-theoretic and dynamical characterizations, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding program behavior. We establish the foundational properties of the trap space semantics and systematically relate it to the established model-theoretic semantics, including the stable (supported), stable (supported) partial, regular, and L-stable model semantics, as well as to the dynamical stable (supported) class semantics. Our results demonstrate that the trap space semantics offers a unified and precise framework for proving the existence of supported classes, strict stable (supported) classes, and regular models, in addition to uncovering and formalizing deeper relationships among the existing semantics of normal logic programs.",

Although GANs have shown remarkable success in generating realistic data, they often lack mechanisms to incorporate prior knowledge or enforce logical consistency, limiting their applicability in domains requiring rule adherence. LTNs provide a principled way to integrate first-order logic with neural networks, enabling models to reason over and satisfy logical constraints. By combining the strengths of GANs for realistic data synthesis with LTNs for logical reasoning, we gain valuable insights into how logical constraints influence the generative process while improving both the diversity and logical consistency of the generated samples. We evaluate LTN-GAN across multiple datasets, including synthetic datasets (gaussian, grid, rings) and the MNIST dataset, demonstrating that our model significantly outperforms traditional GANs in terms of adherence to predefined logical constraints while maintaining the quality and diversity of generated samples. This work highlights the potential of neuro-symbolic approaches to enhance generative modeling in knowledge-intensive domains.",

        "summary": "Generalizable 3D Gaussian Splatting aims to directly predict Gaussian parameters using a feed-forward network for scene reconstruction. Among these parameters, Gaussian means are particularly difficult to predict, so depth is usually estimated first and then unprojected to obtain the Gaussian sphere centers. Existing methods typically rely solely on a single warp to estimate depth probability, which hinders their ability to fully leverage cross-view geometric cues, resulting in unstable and coarse depth maps. To address this limitation, we propose IDESplat, which iteratively applies warp operations to boost depth probability estimation for accurate Gaussian mean prediction. First, to eliminate the inherent instability of a single warp, we introduce a Depth Probability Boosting Unit (DPBU) that integrates epipolar attention maps produced by cascading warp operations in a multiplicative manner. Next, we construct an iterative depth estimation process by stacking multiple DPBUs, progressively identifying potential depth candidates with high likelihood. As IDESplat iteratively boosts depth probability estimates and updates the depth candidates, the depth map is gradually refined, resulting in accurate Gaussian means. We conduct experiments on RealEstate10K, ACID, and DL3DV. IDESplat achieves outstanding reconstruction quality and state-of-the-art performance with real-time efficiency. On RE10K, it outperforms DepthSplat by 0.33 dB in PSNR, using only 10.7% of the parameters and 70% of the memory. Additionally, our IDESplat improves PSNR by 2.95 dB over DepthSplat on the DTU dataset in cross-dataset experiments, demonstrating its strong generalization ability.",

Drawing from the Scopus database of peer-reviewed literature, the review highlights research efforts to model financial narratives using various NLP techniques. Results reveal that while advances have been made, the conceptualization of financial narratives remains fragmented, often reduced to sentiment analysis, topic modeling, or their combination, without a unified theoretical framework.

We introduce PointWorld, a large pre-trained 3D world model that unifies state and action in a shared 3D space as 3D point flows: given one or few RGB-D images and a sequence of low-level robot action commands, PointWorld forecasts per-pixel displacements in 3D that respond to the given actions. By representing actions as 3D point flows instead of embodiment-specific action spaces (e.g., joint positions), this formulation directly conditions on physical geometries of robots while seamlessly integrating learning across embodiments. To train our 3D world model, we curate a large-scale dataset spanning real and simulated robotic manipulation in open-world environments, enabled by recent advances in 3D vision and simulated environments, totaling about 2M trajectories and 500 hours across a single-arm Franka and a bimanual humanoid. Through rigorous, large-scale empirical studies of backbones, action representations, learning objectives, partial observability, data mixtures, domain transfers, and scaling, we distill design principles for large-scale 3D world modeling. With a real-time (0.1s) inference speed, PointWorld can be efficiently integrated in the model-predictive control (MPC) framework for manipulation. We demonstrate that a single pre-trained checkpoint enables a real-world Franka robot to perform rigid-body pushing, deformable and articulated object manipulation, and tool use, without requiring any demonstrations or post-training and all from a single image captured in-the-wild.

        "summary": "We analyze neural scaling laws in a solvable model of last-layer fine-tuning where targets have intrinsic, instance-heterogeneous difficulty. In our Latent Instance Difficulty (LID) model, each input's target variance is governed by a latent ``precision'' drawn from a heavy-tailed distribution. While generalization loss recovers standard scaling laws, our main contribution connects this to inference. The pass@$k$ failure rate exhibits a power-law decay, $k^{-β_\\text{eff}}$, but the observed exponent $β_\\text{eff}$ is training-dependent. It grows with sample size $N$ before saturating at an intrinsic limit $β$ set by the difficulty distribution's tail. This coupling reveals that learning shrinks the ``hard tail'' of the error distribution: improvements in the model's generalization error steepen the pass@$k$ curve until irreducible target variance dominates. The LID model yields testable, closed-form predictions for this behavior, including a compute-allocation rule that favors training before saturation and inference attempts after. We validate these predictions in simulations and in two real-data proxies: CIFAR-10H (human-label variance) and a maths teacher-student distillation task.",

        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed on large-scale document collections, often comprising millions of documents and tens of millions of text chunks. In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.",

Furthermore, we establish a fine-grained diagnostic system using dynamic program slicing, quantifying reasoning via three orthogonal metrics: $ESV$ (reading load), $MCL$ (simulation depth), and $DFI$ (integration width). Comprehensive evaluations of frontier models (e.g., Claude-4.5-Sonnet, DeepSeek-v3.1-Terminus) reveal a prevalent aggregation deficit, where integration width serves as the primary cognitive bottleneck. Our findings provide granular white-box insights for optimizing the next generation of agentic software engineering.",

        "summary": "Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables users to search for target images using both a reference image and manipulation text, offering substantial advantages over single-modality retrieval systems. However, existing CIR methods suffer from representation space fragmentation: queries and targets comprise heterogeneous modalities and are processed by distinct encoders, forcing models to bridge misaligned representation spaces only through post-hoc alignment, which fundamentally limits retrieval performance. This architectural asymmetry manifests as three distinct, well-separated clusters in the feature space, directly demonstrating how heterogeneous modalities create fundamentally misaligned representation spaces from initialization. In this work, we propose CSMCIR, a unified representation framework that achieves efficient query-target alignment through three synergistic components. First, we introduce a Multi-level Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting strategy that guides Multimodal Large Language Models to generate discriminative, semantically compatible captions for target images, establishing modal symmetry. Building upon this, we design a symmetric dual-tower architecture where both query and target sides utilize the identical shared-parameter Q-Former for cross-modal encoding, ensuring consistent feature representations and further reducing the alignment gap. Finally, this architectural symmetry enables an entropy-based, temporally dynamic Memory Bank strategy that provides high-quality negative samples while maintaining consistency with the evolving model state. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that our CSMCIR achieves state-of-the-art performance with superior training efficiency. Comprehensive ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of each proposed component.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning drives recent advances in LLM reasoning and agentic capabilities, yet current approaches struggle with both exploration and exploitation. Exploration suffers from low success rates on difficult tasks and high costs of repeated rollouts from scratch. Exploitation suffers from coarse credit assignment and training instability: Trajectory-level rewards penalize valid prefixes for later errors, and failure-dominated groups overwhelm the few positive signals, leaving optimization without constructive direction. To this end, we propose R$^3$L, Reflect-then-Retry Reinforcement Learning with Language-Guided Exploration, Pivotal Credit, and Positive Amplification. To synthesize high-quality trajectories, R$^3$L shifts from stochastic sampling to active synthesis via reflect-then-retry, leveraging language feedback to diagnose errors, transform failed attempts into successful ones, and reduce rollout costs by restarting from identified failure points. With errors diagnosed and localized, Pivotal Credit Assignment updates only the diverging suffix where contrastive signals exist, excluding the shared prefix from gradient update. Since failures dominate on difficult tasks and reflect-then-retry produces off-policy data, risking training instability, Positive Amplification upweights successful trajectories to ensure positive signals guide the optimization process. Experiments on agentic and reasoning tasks demonstrate 5\\% to 52\\% relative improvements over baselines while maintaining training stability.

        "summary": "The trade-off between predictive accuracy and data availability makes it difficult to predict protein--protein binding affinity accurately. The lack of experimentally resolved protein structures limits the performance of structure-based machine learning models, which generally outperform sequence-based methods. In order to overcome this constraint, we suggest a regression framework based on knowledge distillation that uses protein structural data during training and only needs sequence data during inference. The suggested method uses binding affinity labels and intermediate feature representations to jointly supervise the training of a sequence-based student network under the guidance of a structure-informed teacher network. Leave-One-Complex-Out (LOCO) cross-validation was used to assess the framework on a non-redundant protein--protein binding affinity benchmark dataset. A maximum Pearson correlation coefficient (P_r) of 0.375 and an RMSE of 2.712 kcal/mol were obtained by sequence-only baseline models, whereas a P_r of 0.512 and an RMSE of 2.445 kcal/mol were obtained by structure-based models. With a P_r of 0.481 and an RMSE of 2.488 kcal/mol, the distillation-based student model greatly enhanced sequence-only performance. Improved agreement and decreased bias were further confirmed by thorough error analyses. With the potential to close the performance gap between sequence-based and structure-based models as larger datasets become available, these findings show that knowledge distillation is an efficient method for transferring structural knowledge to sequence-based predictors. The source code for running inference with the proposed distillation-based binding affinity predictor can be accessed at https://github.com/wajidarshad/ProteinAffinityKD.",

However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.",

First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches.

        "summary": "Engineering education faces a double disruption: traditional apprenticeship models that cultivated judgment and tacit skill are eroding, just as generative AI emerges as an informal coaching partner. This convergence rekindles long-standing questions in the philosophy of AI and cognition about the limits of computation, the nature of embodied rationality, and the distinction between information processing and wisdom. Building on this rich intellectual tradition, this paper examines whether AI chatbots can provide coaching that fosters mastery rather than merely delivering information. We synthesize critical perspectives from decades of scholarship on expertise, tacit knowledge, and human-machine interaction, situating them within the context of contemporary AI-driven education. Empirically, we report findings from a mixed-methods study (N = 75 students, N = 7 faculty) exploring the use of a coaching chatbot in engineering education. Results reveal a consistent boundary: participants accept AI for technical problem solving (convergent tasks; M = 3.84 on a 1-5 Likert scale) but remain skeptical of its capacity for moral, emotional, and contextual judgment (divergent tasks). Faculty express stronger concerns over risk (M = 4.71 vs. M = 4.14, p = 0.003), and privacy emerges as a key requirement, with 64-71 percent of participants demanding strict confidentiality. Our findings suggest that while generative AI can democratize access to cognitive and procedural support, it cannot replicate the embodied, value-laden dimensions of human mentorship. We propose a multiplex coaching framework that integrates human wisdom within expert-in-the-loop models, preserving the depth of apprenticeship while leveraging AI scalability to enrich the next generation of engineering education.",

This work introduces a heteroscedastic Bayesian Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework that jointly models epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, yielding full predictive posteriors for spatiotemporal insulation material ageing estimation. The approach integrates Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) with physics-based residual enforcement and prior distributions, enabling probabilistic inference within a physics-informed learning architecture. The framework is evaluated on transformer insulation ageing application, validated with a finite-element thermal model and field measurements from a solar power plant, and benchmarked against deterministic PINNs, dropout-based PINNs (d-PINNs), and alternative B-PINN variants. Results show that the proposed B-PINN provides improved predictive accuracy and better-calibrated uncertainty estimates than competing approaches. A systematic sensitivity study further analyzes the impact of boundary-condition, initial-condition, and residual sampling strategies on accuracy, calibration, and generalization.

As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized. We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints.

This method referred to as Group and Exclusive Sparsity based Continual Learning (GESCL) avoids forgetting of previous tasks by ensuring the stability of the CNN via a stability regularization term, which prevents filters detected as important for past tasks to deviate too much when learning a new task. On top of that, GESCL makes the network plastic via a plasticity regularization term that leverage the over-parameterization of CNNs to efficiently sparsify the network and tunes unimportant filters making them relevant for future tasks. Doing so, GESCL deals with significantly less parameters and computation compared to CL approaches that either dynamically expand the network or memorize past tasks' data. Experiments on popular CL vision benchmarks show that GESCL leads to significant improvements over state-of-the-art method in terms of overall CL performance, as measured by classification accuracy as well as in terms of avoiding catastrophic forgetting.",

We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts.

These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making.

On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively.

To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.",

        "summary": "Zero-shot text-to-speech models can clone a speaker's timbre from a short reference audio, but they also strongly inherit the speaking style present in the reference. As a result, synthesizing speech with a desired style often requires carefully selecting reference audio, which is impractical when only limited or mismatched references are available. While recent controllable TTS methods attempt to address this issue, they typically rely on absolute style targets and discrete textual prompts, and therefore do not support continuous and reference-relative style control. We propose ReStyle-TTS, a framework that enables continuous and reference-relative style control in zero-shot TTS. Our key insight is that effective style control requires first reducing the model's implicit dependence on reference style before introducing explicit control mechanisms. To this end, we introduce Decoupled Classifier-Free Guidance (DCFG), which independently controls text and reference guidance, reducing reliance on reference style while preserving text fidelity. On top of this, we apply style-specific LoRAs together with Orthogonal LoRA Fusion to enable continuous and disentangled multi-attribute control, and introduce a Timbre Consistency Optimization module to mitigate timbre drift caused by weakened reference guidance. Experiments show that ReStyle-TTS enables user-friendly, continuous, and relative control over pitch, energy, and multiple emotions while maintaining intelligibility and speaker timbre, and performs robustly in challenging mismatched reference-target style scenarios.",

Automated classification of these sounds faces challenges due to subtle acoustic differences and severe class imbalance in clinical datasets. This study investigates respiratory sound classification with a focus on mitigating pronounced class imbalance.

The model is integrated with a comprehensive feature extraction pipeline and targeted imbalance mitigation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a public respiratory sound database comprising six classes with a highly skewed distribution. Techniques such as focal loss, class-specific data augmentation, and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) were employed to enhance minority class recognition. The proposed Hybrid LSTM-KAN model achieves an overall accuracy of 94.6 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of 0.703, despite the dominant COPD class accounting for over 86 percent of the data. Improved detection performance is observed for minority classes compared to baseline approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed architecture for imbalanced respiratory sound classification.",

However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.",

Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.",

Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant \"spatial gap\" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential.

To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.",

Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias.

In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models.

Our method compresses long user interaction histories into learnable tokens, which are then combined with recent interactions to generate recommendations. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high recommendation accuracy. Our method could be applied to existing transformer based recommendation models, e.g., HSTU and HLLM. Extensive experiments on multiple sequential models demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness.

        "summary": "End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.",

        "summary": "We study the problem of imputing a designated target variable that is systematically missing in a shifted deployment domain, when a Gaussian causal DAG is available from a fully observed source domain. We propose a unified EM-based framework that combines source and target data through the DAG structure to transfer information from observed variables to the missing target. On the methodological side, we formulate a population EM operator in the DAG parameter space and introduce a first-order (gradient) EM update that replaces the costly generalized least-squares M-step with a single projected gradient step. Under standard local strong-concavity and smoothness assumptions and a BWY-style \\cite{Balakrishnan2017EM} gradient-stability (bounded missing-information) condition, we show that this first-order EM operator is locally contractive around the true target parameters, yielding geometric convergence and finite-sample guarantees on parameter error and the induced target-imputation error in Gaussian SEMs under covariate shift and local mechanism shifts. Algorithmically, we exploit the known causal DAG to freeze source-invariant mechanisms and re-estimate only those conditional distributions directly affected by the shift, making the procedure scalable to higher-dimensional models. In experiments on a synthetic seven-node SEM, the 64-node MAGIC-IRRI genetic network, and the Sachs protein-signaling data, the proposed DAG-aware first-order EM algorithm improves target imputation accuracy over a fit-on-source Bayesian network and a Kiiveri-style EM baseline, with the largest gains under pronounced domain shift.",

Here we address this problem by analyzing the separability of real and super-resolved audio in various embedding spaces. We consider both middle-band ($4\\to 16$~kHz) and full-band ($16\\to 48$~kHz) upsampling tasks for speech and music, training linear classifiers to distinguish real from synthetic samples based on multiple types of audio embeddings. Comparisons with objective metrics and subjective listening tests reveal that embedding-based classifiers achieve near-perfect separation, even when the generated audio attains high perceptual quality and state-of-the-art metric scores. This behavior is consistent across datasets and models, including recent diffusion-based approaches, highlighting a persistent gap between perceptual quality and true distributional fidelity in ADSR models.",

We applied this framework in the context of gravitational-wave research related to the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory. Answers are grounded in a curated semantic index of research literature, doctoral theses, LIGO documents, and long-running detector electronic logbooks, with targeted web searches when appropriate. Because direct benchmarking against commercial LLMs cannot be performed on private data, we evaluated MARVEL on two publicly available surrogate datasets that capture comparable semantic and technical characteristics. On these benchmarks, MARVEL matches a GPT-4o mini baseline on literature-centric queries and substantially outperforms it on detector-operations content, where domain retrieval and guided reasoning are decisive.

In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.",

We challenge these constraints by demonstrating that token-level iterative optimization can succeed without gradients or priors. We introduce RAILS (RAndom Iterative Local Search), a framework that operates solely on model logits. RAILS matches the effectiveness of gradient-based methods through two key innovations: a novel auto-regressive loss that enforces exact prefix matching, and a history-based selection strategy that bridges the gap between the proxy optimization objective and the true attack success rate. Crucially, by eliminating gradient dependency, RAILS enables cross-tokenizer ensemble attacks. This allows for the discovery of shared adversarial patterns that generalize across disjoint vocabularies, significantly enhancing transferability to closed-source systems. Empirically, RAILS achieves near 100% success rates on multiple open-source models and high black-box attack transferability to closed-source systems like GPT and Gemini.",

In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems.

However, their utility is currently limited because EEG decoding often suffers from poor generalization due to distribution shifts across domains (e.g., subjects). Learning robust representations that capture underlying task-relevant information would mitigate these shifts and improve generalization. One promising approach is to exploit the underlying hierarchical structure in EEG, as recent studies suggest that hierarchical cognitive processes, such as visual processing, can be encoded in EEG. While many decoding methods still rely on Euclidean embeddings, recent work has begun exploring hyperbolic geometry for EEG. Hyperbolic spaces, regarded as the continuous analogue of tree structures, provide a natural geometry for representing hierarchical data. In this study, we first empirically demonstrate that EEG data exhibit hyperbolicity and show that hyperbolic embeddings improve generalization. Motivated by these findings, we propose HEEGNet, a hybrid hyperbolic network architecture to capture the hierarchical structure in EEG and learn domain-invariant hyperbolic embeddings. To this end, HEEGNet combines both Euclidean and hyperbolic encoders and employs a novel coarse-to-fine domain adaptation strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple public EEG datasets, covering visual evoked potentials, emotion recognition, and intracranial EEG, demonstrate that HEEGNet achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation.

In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \\emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.",

        "summary": "A photorealistic and controllable 3D caricaturization framework for faces is introduced. We start with an intrinsic Gaussian curvature-based surface exaggeration technique, which, when coupled with texture, tends to produce over-smoothed renders. To address this, we resort to 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), which has recently been shown to produce realistic free-viewpoint avatars. Given a multiview sequence, we extract a FLAME mesh, solve a curvature-weighted Poisson equation, and obtain its exaggerated form. However, directly deforming the Gaussians yields poor results, necessitating the synthesis of pseudo-ground-truth caricature images by warping each frame to its exaggerated 2D representation using local affine transformations. We then devise a training scheme that alternates real and synthesized supervision, enabling a single Gaussian collection to represent both natural and exaggerated avatars. This scheme improves fidelity, supports local edits, and allows continuous control over the intensity of the caricature. In order to achieve real-time deformations, an efficient interpolation between the original and exaggerated surfaces is introduced. We further analyze and show that it has a bounded deviation from closed-form solutions. In both quantitative and qualitative evaluations, our results outperform prior work, delivering photorealistic, geometry-controlled caricature avatars.",

To address these issues, this study leverages deep learning-based image recognition for automated classification of white shrimp immediately after harvest. A convolutional neural network (CNN) model replaces manual sorting, enhancing classification accuracy, efficiency, and consistency.

This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.",

        "summary": "The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.",

Most of it (about 130k lines) have been done in two weeks,from December 22 to January 4, for an LLM subscription cost of about \\$100. This includes a 3k-line proof of Urysohn's lemma, a 2k-line proof of Urysohn's Metrization theorem, over 10k-line proof of the Tietze extension theorem, and many more (in total over 1.5k lemmas/theorems). The approach is quite simple and cheap: build a long-running feedback loop between an LLM and a reasonably fast proof checker equipped with a core foundational library. The LLM is now instantiated as ChatGPT (mostly 5.2) or Claude Sonnet (4.5) run through the respective Codex or Claude Code command line interfaces. The proof checker is Chad Brown's higher-order set theory system Megalodon, and the core library is Brown's formalization of basic set theory and surreal numbers (including reals, etc). The rest is some prompt engineering and technical choices which we describe here. Based on the fast progress, low cost, virtually unknown ITP/library, and the simple setup available to everyone, we believe that (auto)formalization may become quite easy and ubiquitous in 2026, regardless of which proof assistant is used.",

While content watermarking effectively attributes LLM-generated outputs, it fails to directly identify the high-level planning behaviors (e.g., tool and subgoal choices) that govern multi-step execution. Critically, watermarking at the planning-behavior layer faces unique challenges: minor distributional deviations in decision-making can compound during long-term agent operation, degrading utility, and many agents operate as black boxes that are difficult to intervene in directly. To bridge this gap, we propose AgentMark, a behavioral watermarking framework that embeds multi-bit identifiers into planning decisions while preserving utility. It operates by eliciting an explicit behavior distribution from the agent and applying distribution-preserving conditional sampling, enabling deployment under black-box APIs while remaining compatible with action-layer content watermarking. Experiments across embodied, tool-use, and social environments demonstrate practical multi-bit capacity, robust recovery from partial logs, and utility preservation.

This paper investigates whether Large Language Models (LLMs) can augment post-incident review workflows by autonomously analysing system evidence and identifying security policy gaps. We present a threat-informed, agentic framework that ingests log data, maps observed behaviours to the MITRE ATT&CK framework, and evaluates organisational security policies for adequacy and compliance. Using a simulated brute-force attack scenario against a Windows OpenSSH service (MITRE ATT&CK T1110), the system leverages GPT-4o for reasoning, LangGraph for multi-agent workflow orchestration, and LlamaIndex for traceable policy retrieval. Experimental results indicate that the LLM-based pipeline can interpret log-derived evidence, identify insufficient or missing policy controls, and generate actionable remediation recommendations with explicit evidence-to-policy traceability. Unlike prior work that treats log analysis and policy validation as isolated tasks, this study integrates both into a unified end-to-end proof-of-concept post-incident review framework.

Our approach employs a fictitious-response rebuttal method that quantifies LLM behavior when presented with multiple-choice questions followed by deliberate challenges to their fictitious previous response. The indices are specifically designed to detect and measure what could be characterized as sycophantic behavior (excessive agreement with user challenges) or stubborn responses (rigid adherence to the fictitious response in the chat history) from LLMs. These metrics allow investigation of the relationships between sycophancy, stubbornness, and the model's actual mastery of the subject matter. We demonstrate the utility of these indices using two physics problems as test scenarios with various OpenAI models. The framework is intentionally generalizable to any multiple-choice format question, including on topics without universally accepted correct answers. Our results reveal measurable differences across OpenAI model generations, with trends indicating that newer models and those employing greater \"Reasoning Effort\" exhibit reduced sycophantic behavior.

However, existing evaluations rarely assess whether such agents remain safe, protocol compliant, and effective under realistic next generation networking constraints. This paper introduces $α^3$-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM driven UAV autonomy as a multi turn conversational reasoning and control problem operating under dynamic 6G conditions. Each mission is formulated as a language mediated control loop between an LLM based UAV agent and a human operator, where decisions must satisfy strict schema validity, mission policies, speaker alternation, and safety constraints while adapting to fluctuating network slices, latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput, and edge load variations. To reflect modern agentic workflows, $α^3$-Bench integrates a dual action layer supporting both tool calls and agent to agent coordination, enabling evaluation of tool use consistency and multi agent interactions. We construct a large scale corpus of 113k conversational UAV episodes grounded in UAVBench scenarios and evaluate 17 state of the art LLMs using a fixed subset of 50 episodes per scenario under deterministic decoding. We propose a composite $α^3$ metric that unifies six pillars: Task Outcome, Safety Policy, Tool Consistency, Interaction Quality, Network Robustness, and Communication Cost, with efficiency normalized scores per second and per thousand tokens. Results show that while several models achieve high mission success and safety compliance, robustness and efficiency vary significantly under degraded 6G conditions, highlighting the need for network aware and resource efficient LLM based UAV agents.

The method maps each slack variable to a dedicated ancilla qubit, transforming the problem into a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) formulation suitable for the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA). This process internalizes the constraints within the quantum state, altering the problem's energy landscape to facilitate optimization. The model is empirically validated through simulation, showing it consistently finds the optimal portfolio where a standard penalty-based QAOA fails. This work demonstrates that modifying the Hamiltonian architecture via a slack-ancilla scheme provides a robust and effective pathway for solving constrained optimization problems on quantum computers. A fundamental quantum limit on the simultaneous precision of portfolio risk and return is also posited.",
