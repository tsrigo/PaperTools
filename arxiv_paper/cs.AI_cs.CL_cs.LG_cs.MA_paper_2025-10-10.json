        "summary": "Multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) remains a critical problem in robotics and autonomous systems, where agents must navigate shared spaces efficiently while avoiding conflicts. Traditional centralized algorithms that have global information, such as Conflict-Based Search (CBS), provide high-quality solutions but become computationally expensive in large-scale scenarios due to the combinatorial explosion of conflicts that need resolution. Conversely, distributed approaches that have local information, particularly learning-based methods, offer better scalability by operating with relaxed information availability, yet often at the cost of solution quality. To address these limitations, we propose a hybrid framework that combines decentralized path planning with a lightweight centralized coordinator. Our framework leverages reinforcement learning (RL) for decentralized planning, enabling agents to adapt their planning based on minimal, targeted alerts--such as static conflict-cell flags or brief conflict tracks--that are dynamically shared information from the central coordinator for effective conflict resolution. We empirically study the effect of the information available to an agent on its planning performance. Our approach reduces the inter-agent information sharing compared to fully centralized and distributed methods, while still consistently finding feasible, collision-free solutions--even in large-scale scenarios having higher agent counts.",

This work is the first to introduce GRPO into spatial public goods games, establishing a new deep reinforcement learning baseline for structured populations. GRPO-GCC integrates group relative policy optimization with a global cooperation constraint that strengthens incentives at intermediate cooperation levels while weakening them at extremes. This mechanism aligns local decision making with sustainable collective outcomes and prevents collapse into either universal defection or unconditional cooperation. The framework advances beyond existing approaches by combining group-normalized advantage estimation, a reference-anchored KL penalty, and a global incentive term that dynamically adjusts cooperative payoffs. As a result, it achieves accelerated cooperation onset, stabilized policy adaptation, and long-term sustainability. GRPO-GCC demonstrates how a simple yet global signal can reshape incentives toward resilient cooperation, and provides a new paradigm for multi-agent reinforcement learning in socio-technical systems.",

        "summary": "Alzheimer's disease (AD) presents a complex, multifaceted challenge to patients, caregivers, and the healthcare system, necessitating integrated and dynamic support solutions. While artificial intelligence (AI) offers promising avenues for intervention, current applications are often siloed, addressing singular aspects of the disease such as diagnostics or caregiver support without systemic integration. This paper proposes a novel methodological framework for a comprehensive, multi-agent system (MAS) designed for holistic Alzheimer's disease management. The objective is to detail the architecture of a collaborative ecosystem of specialized AI agents, each engineered to address a distinct challenge in the AD care continuum, from caregiver support and multimodal data analysis to automated research and clinical data interpretation. The proposed framework is composed of eight specialized, interoperable agents. These agents are categorized by function: (1) Caregiver and Patient Support, (2) Data Analysis and Research, and (3) Advanced Multimodal Workflows. The methodology details the technical architecture of each agent, leveraging a suite of advanced technologies including large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o and Gemini, multi-agent orchestration frameworks, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for evidence-grounded responses, and specialized tools for web scraping, multimodal data processing, and in-memory database querying. This paper presents a detailed architectural blueprint for an integrated AI ecosystem for AD care. By moving beyond single-purpose tools to a collaborative, multi-agent paradigm, this framework establishes a foundation for developing more adaptive, personalized, and proactive solutions. This methodological approach aims to pave the way for future systems capable of synthesizing diverse data streams to improve patient outcomes and reduce caregiver burden.",

In this paper, we explore this issue with a focus on the data visualization domain, where ambiguities in natural language impact the generation of code that visualizes data. The availability of multiple views on the contextual (e.g., the intended plot and the code rendering the plot) allows for a unique and comprehensive analysis of diverse ambiguity types. We develop a taxonomy of types of ambiguity that arise in this task and propose metrics to quantify them. Using Matplotlib problems from the DS-1000 dataset, we demonstrate that our ambiguity metrics better correlate with human annotations than uncertainty baselines. Our work also explores how multi-turn dialogue can reduce ambiguity, therefore, improve code accuracy by better matching user goals. We evaluate three pragmatic models to inform our dialogue strategies: Gricean Cooperativity, Discourse Representation Theory, and Questions under Discussion. A simulated user study reveals how pragmatic dialogues reduce ambiguity and enhance code accuracy, highlighting the value of multi-turn exchanges in code generation.",

Centralized methods achieve global optimality but suffer from high communication overhead, while distributed methods are efficient but lack the broader awareness to avoid deadlocks and topological traps. To address this, we propose a fully decentralized, hierarchical relative navigation framework that achieves both strategic foresight and tactical agility without a unified coordinate system. At the strategic layer, robots build and exchange lightweight topological maps upon opportunistic encounters. This process fosters an emergent global awareness, enabling the planning of efficient, trap-avoiding routes at an abstract level. This high-level plan then inspires the tactical layer, which operates on local metric information. Here, a sampling-based escape point strategy resolves dense spatio-temporal conflicts by generating dynamically feasible trajectories in real time, concurrently satisfying tight environmental and kinodynamic constraints. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments demonstrate that our system significantly outperforms in success rate and efficiency, especially in communication-limited environments with complex topological structures.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning, yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice: models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to baselines across diverse tasks.

The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95% errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted improvement of agent performance.",

        "summary": "Long-term memory is essential for natural, realistic dialogue. However, current large language model (LLM) memory systems rely on either brute-force context expansion or static retrieval pipelines that fail on edge-constrained devices. We introduce Mnemosyne, an unsupervised, human-inspired long-term memory architecture designed for edge-based LLMs. Our approach uses graph-structured storage, modular substance and redundancy filters, memory committing and pruning mechanisms, and probabilistic recall with temporal decay and refresh processes modeled after human memory. Mnemosyne also introduces a concentrated \"core summary\" efficiently derived from a fixed-length subset of the memory graph to capture the user's personality and other domain-specific long-term details such as, using healthcare application as an example, post-recovery ambitions and attitude towards care. Unlike existing retrieval-augmented methods, Mnemosyne is designed for use in longitudinal healthcare assistants, where repetitive and semantically similar but temporally distinct conversations are limited by naive retrieval. In experiments with longitudinal healthcare dialogues, Mnemosyne demonstrates the highest win rate of 65.8% in blind human evaluations of realism and long-term memory capability compared to a baseline RAG win rate of 31.1%. Mnemosyne also achieves current highest LoCoMo benchmark scores in temporal reasoning and single-hop retrieval compared to other same-backboned techniques. Further, the average overall score of 54.6% was second highest across all methods, beating commonly used Mem0 and OpenAI baselines among others. This demonstrates that improved factual recall, enhanced temporal reasoning, and much more natural user-facing responses can be feasible with an edge-compatible and easily transferable unsupervised memory architecture.",

They work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate, while using fewer reward evaluations.",

Cellular subpopulations may shift from cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular, posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE (Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology. First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding challenge in computational biology.",

Existing models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness, and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+ datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30 archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity, demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\\% of the full-model performance while offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware time series modeling.",

However,existing physics-based and data-driven models often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems.

To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data. We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37 years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States, Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\\epsilon$ and the policy variance $\\sigma^2$.

Given a private distribution $P \\in \\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in $f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class $\\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this, we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$. Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of $f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.",

Diffusion-based models have shown strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS), we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass, achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model. We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details, the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional weather forecasting",

These tools are robust against inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds. The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian exponential maps on latent manifolds.

Prior work treats this as a security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice, most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires, as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.",

        "summary": "Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches. Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures. Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding and practical performance.",

While cross-attention is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300 experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter. We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in multi-modal research.",

However, recent work has raised concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density, temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.",

        "summary": "Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver, as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a 10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.",

This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design principles linking architectural choices to model properties.

While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy. To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity, we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness, an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own, preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales, while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data efficiency.Code is available on Github.",

Our experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning, implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2) the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.",

Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live, interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live, explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events (arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial advantage for a reliable decision support tool.",

Human evaluations are more reliable but costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence. Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust, interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.",

        "summary": "Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM ecosystems.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness, we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance degradation and the severity of shocks.

However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios. Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and real-world datasets.",

This leads to poor generalization in unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.",

To tackle this problem, we then propose the Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.",

Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge. Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment. Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.",

Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\\times$ and computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\\times$.

Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training: improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation. However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting. We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level. In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over 40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.",

Existing studies have proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in DPML.",

In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that our approach reduces memory by over $90\\%$ in momentum while maintaining both efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from 60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further reduce memory by up to $95\\%$ in optimizer states by combining the memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\\%$ GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.",

Recently, there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery, particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.

In this work, we explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from 0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points, combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.",

        "summary": "Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment. Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii) they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation. Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least 27.9\\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based autonomous driving.",

Specifically, the standard gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting wider minima.

We argue that this evaluation process is flawed. Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent, reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass 12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally reported near-zero attack success rates.

Our analysis reveals two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact shifting.

Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring broad applicability.

We present Slim Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio, and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline, Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A 96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.",

        "summary": "Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.",

These risks have spurred interest in LLM unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean, well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets. By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow lexical patterns.",

We evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency.

        "summary": "While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints, especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint) pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity. Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions, improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger structural alignment.

        "summary": "The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints. Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client. Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition, a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.",

Reinforcement learning with intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias: the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses, with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\\rho_{\\text{noise}}$, $\\rho_{\\text{selfbias}}$, and $\\rho_{\\text{symbias}}$. We find that $\\rho_{\\text{noise}}$ and $\\rho_{\\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while $\\rho_{\\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.",

Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in terms of test accuracy and generalization.

Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths, thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations, we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.",

        "summary": "Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale. However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting. The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger robustness.",

First, an AoI calculation model influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval (RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.

        "summary": "The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive parameter adjustment.",

ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit assignment.

        "summary": "We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work (Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting. We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025). We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$ (off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from $T^{2/3}$ to $\\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.",

Yet, deep neural networks (DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream. Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of neural tuning.",

However, current SAE training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a foundation for more reliable model analysis.",

Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\\em Do CL and NSCL also remain aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their objectives?} We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with training time. Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning.

Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE, the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE) prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts, underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for more robust, equitable prognostic models.",

In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios.

We model successful pulling of public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at a $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the $\\Theta(\\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.",

        "summary": "Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization, and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation.

We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL algorithms.

However, these models typically operate on raw text, overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations, that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy, moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually aware embedding models.",

The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space, requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore, on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original policy remains effective.

However, due to the complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters, traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage, tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images. Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency. The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality objectives.

Leveraging this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures to advance robust causal inference in structured data.",

We bridge this gap by proposing a framework that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization, including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data, more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and inferencing factors.",

The framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free, finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss (generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To address this, we introduce \"conformal risk training,\" an end-to-end approach that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling financial risk in battery storage operation.",

This paper introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles. First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their explanations.",

SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received the same prediction for similar reasons.

These techniques, while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture. Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct, computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable weight updates.",

We close this gap by developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces counterfactually fair prediction sets.

        "summary": "Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks, leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs. For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square (LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger adaptability and robustness.",

Yet GRPO wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses, imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as \\textbf{L}ikelihood \\textbf{E}stimation with \\textbf{N}egative \\textbf{S}amples (\\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These results demonstrate a principled and practical way to \"rescue\" negative groups, improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.",

        "summary": "The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps. Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images, exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa) which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity. Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF) instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint of feature caching by 99%. Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.

One of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique, is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a small benchmark.",

        "summary": "Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP, have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification (\\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for real-world applications.",

However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods: Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm through comparative experiments.",

These failures violate intended invariances, break continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute, model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short, WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or training.",

        "summary": "Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge: current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference, EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an \"energy landscape\". We use the gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.",

In this work, we introduce Prompting Test-Time Scaling (P-TTS), a simple yet effective inference-time data augmentation strategy for enhancing LLM reasoning through finetuning. Rather than collecting thousands or even millions of examples, P-TTS leverages a small pool of only 90 manually selected reasoning instances and systematically varies exemplar augmentation through principled instruction prompting intensities at test time to synthesize diverse reasoning trajectory contexts. Then we finetune the various sizes of Qwen-2.5 models on P-TTS data. Across a suite of mathematical reasoning AIME2024 & 25, MATH500, and GPQA-Diamond, our P-TTS-7B and 32B models outperform the prior competitive baselines like S1 and S1.1 (1K-shot), achieving absolute accuracy gains of +26.66% and +30.00% on AIME'24 (7B), and +13.34% and +6.67% on AIME'25 (7B); P-TTS-32B yields gains of +23.33% and +16.63% on AIME'24, and +26.63% and +3.33% on AIME'25 (vs. S1 and S1.1, respectively), with comparable or better performance on MATH500 and GPQA-Diamond. We further show that P-TTS enhances zero-shot generalization accuracy on out-of-domain reasoning benchmarks of Gaokao, Kaoyan, OlympiadBench, AMC23, GradeSchoolMath, and Minerva. Our analysis suggests that test-time scaling effectively explores the latent space of reasoning patterns, amplifying LLM problem-solving with minimal annotation overhead, and further unlocking the reasoning potential and capabilities of LLMs. Prompting Test-Time Scaling offers a practical, low-cost way to elicit LLM reasoning in resource-constrained or rapidly evolving domains.",

The inverse map, named vector rank, is accessible by reversibly integrating the velocity over time. It is advantageous to leverage the dynamic design: proper constraints on the velocity yield a monotone map, which leads to a conditional Brenier map, enabling a fast and simultaneous generation of Bayesian credible sets whose contours correspond to level sets of Monge-Kantorovich data depth.

In this work, we propose a Bayesian approach designed to efficiently handle these challenges while providing interpretable solutions. Our approach integrates (1) a generative formulation to capture cross-view relationships with a semi-supervised strategy, and (2) a discriminative task-oriented formulation to identify relevant information for specific downstream objectives. This dual generative-discriminative formulation offers both general understanding and task-specific insights; thus, it provides an automatic imputation of the missing views while enabling robust inference across different data sources. The potential of this approach becomes evident when applied to the multimodal clinical data, where our algorithm is able to capture and disentangle the complex interactions among biological, psychological, and sociodemographic modalities.",

In this work, we aim to overcome this gap by focusing our attention to the use of heterogeneous deformation profiles in a parameter estimation problem. More specifically, we adapt EUCLID, an unsupervised method for the automated discovery of constitutive models, towards the purpose of parameter identification for highly nonlinear, orthotropic constitutive models using a Bayesian inference approach and three-dimensional continuum elements. We showcase its strength to quantitatively infer, with varying noise levels, the material model parameters of synthetic myocardial tissue slabs from a single heterogeneous biaxial stretch test. This method shows good agreement with the ground-truth simulations and with corresponding credibility intervals. Our work highlights the potential for characterizing highly nonlinear and orthotropic material models from a single biaxial stretch test with uncertainty quantification.",

        "summary": "Transformer-based models for amortized probabilistic inference, such as neural processes, prior-fitted networks, and tabular foundation models, excel at single-pass marginal prediction. However, many real-world applications, from signal interpolation to multi-column tabular predictions, require coherent joint distributions that capture dependencies between predictions. While purely autoregressive architectures efficiently generate such distributions, they sacrifice the flexible set-conditioning that makes these models powerful for meta-learning. Conversely, the standard approach to obtain joint distributions from set-based models requires expensive re-encoding of the entire augmented conditioning set at each autoregressive step. We introduce a causal autoregressive buffer that preserves the advantages of both paradigms. Our approach decouples context encoding from updating the conditioning set. The model processes the context once and caches it. A dynamic buffer then captures target dependencies: as targets are incorporated, they enter the buffer and attend to both the cached context and previously buffered targets. This enables efficient batched autoregressive generation and one-pass joint log-likelihood evaluation. A unified training strategy allows seamless integration of set-based and autoregressive modes at minimal additional cost. Across synthetic functions, EEG signals, cognitive models, and tabular data, our method matches predictive accuracy of strong baselines while delivering up to 20 times faster joint sampling. Our approach combines the efficiency of autoregressive generative models with the representational power of set-based conditioning, making joint prediction practical for transformer-based probabilistic models.",

This paper addresses the problem of producing a virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters, thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and highlighting the potential of our method.",

Building on this insight, we propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant dimensions.

We delineate two fundamental aspects of this ability: compositionality, the capacity to abstract atomic logical rules underlying complex inferences, and recursiveness, the aptitude to build intricate representations through iterative application of inference rules. In the literature, these two aspects are often confounded together under the umbrella term of generalization. To sharpen this distinction, we investigated the logical generalization capabilities of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) using the syllogistic fragment as a benchmark for natural language reasoning. Though simple, this fragment provides a foundational yet expressive subset of formal logic that supports controlled evaluation of essential reasoning abilities. Our findings reveal a significant disparity: while LLMs demonstrate reasonable proficiency in recursiveness, they struggle with compositionality. To overcome these limitations and establish a reliable logical prover, we propose a hybrid architecture integrating symbolic reasoning with neural computation. This synergistic interaction enables robust and efficient inference, neural components accelerate processing, while symbolic reasoning ensures completeness. Our experiments show that high efficiency is preserved even with relatively small neural components. As part of our proposed methodology, this analysis gives a rationale and highlights the potential of hybrid models to effectively address key generalization barriers in neural reasoning systems.",

However, distribution shifts from unseen environments or compounding action errors can still cause unpredictable and unsafe behavior, leading to task failure. Early failure prediction during runtime is therefore essential for deploying robots in human-centered and safety-critical environments. We propose FIPER, a general framework for Failure Prediction at Runtime for generative IL policies that does not require failure data. FIPER identifies two key indicators of impending failure: (i) out-of-distribution (OOD) observations detected via random network distillation in the policy's embedding space, and (ii) high uncertainty in generated actions measured by a novel action-chunk entropy score. Both failure prediction scores are calibrated using a small set of successful rollouts via conformal prediction. A failure alarm is triggered when both indicators, aggregated over short time windows, exceed their thresholds. We evaluate FIPER across five simulation and real-world environments involving diverse failure modes. Our results demonstrate that FIPER better distinguishes actual failures from benign OOD situations and predicts failures more accurately and earlier than existing methods. We thus consider this work an important step towards more interpretable and safer generative robot policies. Code, data and videos are available at https://tum-lsy.github.io/fiper_website.",

Conditions such as heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment.

Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images. Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation.

We collected whole-head MEG when subjects listened passively to more than seven hours of narrative stories, using the same stimuli in an open fMRI dataset (LeBel et al., 2023). We developed a transformer-based encoding model that combines the MEG and fMRI from these two naturalistic speech comprehension experiments to estimate latent cortical source responses with high spatiotemporal resolution. Our model is trained to predict MEG and fMRI from multiple subjects simultaneously, with a latent layer that represents our estimates of reconstructed cortical sources. Our model predicts MEG better than the common standard of single-modality encoding models, and it also yields source estimates with higher spatial and temporal fidelity than classic minimum-norm solutions in simulation experiments. We validated the estimated latent sources by showing its strong generalizability across unseen subjects and modalities. Estimated activity in our source space predict electrocorticography (ECoG) better than an ECoG-trained encoding model in an entirely new dataset. By integrating the power of large naturalistic experiments, MEG, fMRI, and encoding models, we propose a practical route towards millisecond-and-millimeter brain mapping.",

These challenges make an accurate credit risk assessment by lenders crucial, particularly since SMEs frequently operate within interconnected firm networks through which default risk can propagate. This paper presents and tests a novel approach for modelling the risk of SME credit, using a unique large data set of SME loans provided by a prominent financial institution. Specifically, our approach employs Graph Neural Networks to predict SME default using multilayer network data derived from common ownership and financial transactions between firms. We show that combining this information with traditional structured data not only improves application scoring performance, but also explicitly models contagion risk between companies. Further analysis shows how the directionality and intensity of these connections influence financial risk contagion, offering a deeper understanding of the underlying processes. Our findings highlight the predictive power of network data, as well as the role of supply chain networks in exposing SMEs to correlated default risk.",

The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.",

        "summary": "Engineering risk is concerned with the likelihood of failure and the scenarios when it occurs. The sensitivity of failure probability to change in system parameters is relevant to risk-informed decision making. Computing sensitivity is at least one level more difficult than the probability itself, which is already challenged by a large number of input random variables, rare events and implicit nonlinear `black-box' response. Finite difference with Monte Carlo probability estimates is spurious, requiring the number of samples to grow with the reciprocal of step size to suppress estimation variance. Many existing works gain efficiency by exploiting a specific class of input variables, sensitivity parameters, or response in its exact or surrogate form. For general systems, this work presents a theory and associated Monte Carlo strategy for computing sensitivity using response values and gradients with respect to sensitivity parameters. It is shown that the sensitivity at a given response threshold can be expressed via the expectation of response gradient conditional on the threshold. Determining the expectation requires conditioning on the threshold that is a zero-probability event, but it can be resolved by the concept of kernel smoothing. The proposed method offers sensitivity estimates for all response thresholds generated in a single Monte Carlo run. It is investigated in a number of examples featuring sensitivity parameters of different nature. As response gradient becomes increasingly available, it is hoped that this work can provide the basis for embedding sensitivity calculations with reliability in the same Monte Carlo run.",

        "summary": "Current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) verification methods predict reasoning correctness based on outputs (black-box) or activations (gray-box), but offer limited insight into why a computation fails. We introduce a white-box method: Circuit-based Reasoning Verification (CRV). We hypothesize that attribution graphs of correct CoT steps, viewed as execution traces of the model's latent reasoning circuits, possess distinct structural fingerprints from those of incorrect steps. By training a classifier on structural features of these graphs, we show that these traces contain a powerful signal of reasoning errors. Our white-box approach yields novel scientific insights unattainable by other methods. (1) We demonstrate that structural signatures of error are highly predictive, establishing the viability of verifying reasoning directly via its computational graph. (2) We find these signatures to be highly domain-specific, revealing that failures in different reasoning tasks manifest as distinct computational patterns. (3) We provide evidence that these signatures are not merely correlational; by using our analysis to guide targeted interventions on individual transcoder features, we successfully correct the model's faulty reasoning. Our work shows that, by scrutinizing a model's computational process, we can move from simple error detection to a deeper, causal understanding of LLM reasoning.",

        "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare by supporting more accurate diagnoses and personalized treatments. However, its adoption in practice remains constrained by fragmented data sources, strict privacy rules, and the technical complexity of building reliable clinical systems. To address these challenges, we introduce a model driven engineering (MDE) framework designed specifically for healthcare AI. The framework relies on formal metamodels, domain-specific languages (DSLs), and automated transformations to move from high level specifications to running software. At its core is the Medical Interoperability Language (MILA), a graphical DSL that enables clinicians and data scientists to define queries and machine learning pipelines using shared ontologies. When combined with a federated learning architecture, MILA allows institutions to collaborate without exchanging raw patient data, ensuring semantic consistency across sites while preserving privacy. We evaluate this approach in a multi center cancer immunotherapy study. The generated pipelines delivered strong predictive performance, with support vector machines achieving up to 98.5 percent and 98.3 percent accuracy in key tasks, while substantially reducing manual coding effort. These findings suggest that MDE principles metamodeling, semantic integration, and automated code generation can provide a practical path toward interoperable, reproducible, and trustworthy digital health platforms.",

Traditional defenses, such as adversarial training, typically robustify models by minimizing a worst-case loss. However, these deterministic approaches do not account for uncertainty in the adversary's attack. While stochastic defenses placing a probability distribution on the adversary exist, they often lack statistical rigor and fail to make explicit their underlying assumptions. To resolve these issues, we introduce a formal Bayesian framework that models adversarial uncertainty through a stochastic channel, articulating all probabilistic assumptions. This yields two robustification strategies: a proactive defense enacted during training, aligned with adversarial training, and a reactive defense enacted during operations, aligned with adversarial purification. Several previous defenses can be recovered as limiting cases of our model. We empirically validate our methodology, showcasing the benefits of explicitly modeling adversarial uncertainty.",

However, their reliance on uncurated training datasets raises serious security concerns. Existing backdoor attacks on VLAs mostly assume white-box access and result in task failures instead of enforcing specific actions. In this work, we reveal a more practical threat: attackers can manipulate VLAs by simply injecting physical objects as triggers into the training dataset. We propose goal-oriented backdoor attacks (GoBA), where the VLA behaves normally in the absence of physical triggers but executes predefined and goal-oriented actions in the presence of physical triggers. Specifically, based on a popular VLA benchmark LIBERO, we introduce BadLIBERO that incorporates diverse physical triggers and goal-oriented backdoor actions. In addition, we propose a three-level evaluation that categorizes the victim VLA's actions under GoBA into three states: nothing to do, try to do, and success to do. Experiments show that GoBA enables the victim VLA to successfully achieve the backdoor goal in 97 percentage of inputs when the physical trigger is present, while causing zero performance degradation on clean inputs. Finally, by investigating factors related to GoBA, we find that the action trajectory and trigger color significantly influence attack performance, while trigger size has surprisingly little effect.

Specifically, GREAT targets harmful response generation for a vulnerable user subgroup characterized by both semantically violent requests and emotionally angry triggers. At the core of GREAT is a trigger identification pipeline that operates in the latent embedding space, leveraging principal component analysis and clustering techniques to identify the most representative triggers. To enable this, we present Erinyes, a high-quality dataset of over $5000$ angry triggers curated from GPT-4.1 using a principled, hierarchical, and diversity-promoting approach.

This issue arises when benchmark samples may inadvertently appear in training sets, compromising the validity of reported performance. While detection methods have been developed for the pre-training and Supervised Fine-Tuning stages, a critical research gap exists for the increasingly significant phase of Reinforcement Learning (RL) post-training. As RL post-training becomes pivotal for advancing LLM reasoning, the absence of specialized contamination detection methods in this paradigm presents a critical vulnerability. To address this, we conduct the first systematic study of data detection within RL post-training scenario and propose Self-Critique. Our method is motivated by a key observation: after RL phase, the output entropy distribution of LLMs tends to collapse into highly specific and sparse modes. Self-Critique probes for the underlying policy collapse, i.e., the model's convergence to a narrow reasoning path, which causes this entropy reduction. To facilitate this research, we also introduce RL-MIA, a benchmark constructed to simulate this specific contamination scenario. Extensive experiments show that Self-Critique significantly outperforms baseline methods across multiple models and contamination tasks, achieving an AUC improvement of up to 30%. Whereas existing methods are close to a random guess for RL-phase contamination, our method makes detection possible.",

We evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods. Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy prediction accuracy.

We show that a compact glider settling in a viscous fluid can navigate by dynamically adjusting its centre-of-mass. Using fully resolved direct numerical simulations (DNS) and reinforcement learning, we find two optimal navigation strategies that allow the glider to reach its target location accurately. These strategies depend sensitively on how the glider interacts with the surrounding fluid. The nature of this interaction changes as the particle Reynolds number Re$_p$ changes. Our results explain how the optimal strategy depends on Re$_p$. At large Re$_p$, the glider learns to tumble rapidly by moving its centre-of-mass as its orientation changes. This generates a large horizontal inertial lift force, which allows the glider to travel far. At small Re$_p$, by contrast, high viscosity hinders tumbling. In this case, the glider learns to adjust its centre-of-mass so that it settles with a steady, inclined orientation that results in a horizontal viscous force. The horizontal range is much smaller than for large Re$_p$, because this viscous force is much smaller than the inertial lift force at large Re$_p$. *These authors contributed equally.",

We develop an agent based on the Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm, trained to simulate hedging decisions without making explicit model assumptions on price dynamics. The agent was trained on historical intraday prices of S\\&P~500 call options across years 2004--2024, using a single time series of six predictor variables: option price, underlying asset price, moneyness, time to maturity, realized volatility, and current hedge position. A walk-forward procedure was applied for training, which led to nearly 17~years of out-of-sample evaluation. The performance of the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent is benchmarked against the Black--Scholes delta-hedging strategy over the same period. We assess both approaches using metrics such as annualized return, volatility, information ratio, and Sharpe ratio. To test the models' adaptability, we performed simulations across varying market conditions and added constraints such as transaction costs and risk-awareness penalties. Our results show that the DRL agent can outperform traditional hedging methods, particularly in volatile or high-cost environments, highlighting its robustness and flexibility in practical trading contexts. While the agent consistently outperforms delta-hedging, its performance deteriorates when the risk-awareness parameter is higher. We also observed that the longer the time interval used for volatility estimation, the more stable the results.",

The performance of the RDWT is reported with subject-wise averages using accuracy and Cohen's kappa, complemented by subject-level analyses to identify when RDWT is beneficial. On BCI-IV-2a, RDWT yields clear average gains for EEGTCNet (+4.44 percentage points, pp; kappa +0.059) and MBEEG\\_SENet (+2.23 pp; +0.030), with smaller improvements for EEGNet (+2.08 pp; +0.027) and ShallowConvNet (+0.58 pp; +0.008).

This index evaluates the effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons, the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by 79.6\\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video understanding in the medical field.",

However, these developments have the potential to cause misunderstandings and conflicts, as data poisoning has traditionally been regarded as a security threat to machine learning systems. To address this issue, it is imperative for harmless poisoning generators to claim ownership of their generated datasets, enabling users to identify potential poisoning to prevent misuse. In this paper, we propose the deployment of watermarking schemes as a solution to this challenge. We introduce two provable and practical watermarking approaches for data poisoning: {\\em post-poisoning watermarking} and {\\em poisoning-concurrent watermarking}. Our analyses demonstrate that when the watermarking length is $\\Theta(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon_w)$ for post-poisoning watermarking, and falls within the range of $\\Theta(1/\\epsilon_w^2)$ to $O(\\sqrt{d}/\\epsilon_p)$ for poisoning-concurrent watermarking, the watermarked poisoning dataset provably ensures both watermarking detectability and poisoning utility, certifying the practicality of watermarking under data poisoning attacks.

We propose a flow-matching model with a diffusion transformer (DiT) augmented with permutation invariant robot position and map encoders as the generative model. We develop a custom solver for our SF and equip it with a neural network that predicts context-specific initialization. The initialization network is trained in a self-supervised manner, taking advantage of the differentiability of the SF solver. We advance the state-of-the-art in the following respects. First, we show that we can generate trajectories of tens of robots in cluttered environments in a few tens of milliseconds. This is several times faster than existing centralized optimization approaches. Moreover, our approach also generates smoother trajectories orders of magnitude faster than competing baselines based on diffusion models. Second, each component of our approach can be batched, allowing us to solve a few tens of problem instances in a fraction of a second. We believe this is a first such result; no existing approach provides such capabilities. Finally, our approach can generate a diverse set of trajectories between a given set of start and goal locations, which can capture different collision-avoidance behaviors.",

Our approach relies on generating synthetic data through a suitable compartmental model combined with the incorporation of uncertainty. The available data are then used to calibrate the model, which is further integrated with deep learning techniques to produce additional synthetic data for training. The results show that neural networks trained on these augmented datasets exhibit significantly improved predictive performance. We focus in particular on two different neural network architectures: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and Nonlinear Autoregressive (NAR) models. The NAR approach proves especially effective for short-term forecasting, providing accurate quantitative estimates by directly learning the dynamics from data and avoiding the additional computational cost of embedding physical constraints into the training. In contrast, PINNs yield less accurate quantitative predictions but capture the qualitative long-term behavior of the system, making them more suitable for exploring broader dynamical trends. Numerical simulations of the second phase of the COVID-19 pandemic in the Lombardy region (Italy) validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss, formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically, using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.",

The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline, from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets. Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set, achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported models on this dataset.

        "summary": "Learning from demonstrations enables experts to teach robots complex tasks using interfaces such as kinesthetic teaching, joystick control, and sim-to-real transfer. However, these interfaces often constrain the expert's ability to demonstrate optimal behavior due to indirect control, setup restrictions, and hardware safety. For example, a joystick can move a robotic arm only in a 2D plane, even though the robot operates in a higher-dimensional space. As a result, the demonstrations collected by constrained experts lead to suboptimal performance of the learned policies. This raises a key question: Can a robot learn a better policy than the one demonstrated by a constrained expert? We address this by allowing the agent to go beyond direct imitation of expert actions and explore shorter and more efficient trajectories. We use the demonstrations to infer a state-only reward signal that measures task progress, and self-label reward for unknown states using temporal interpolation. Our approach outperforms common imitation learning in both sample efficiency and task completion time. On a real WidowX robotic arm, it completes the task in 12 seconds, 10x faster than behavioral cloning, as shown in real-robot videos on https://sites.google.com/view/constrainedexpert .",

        "summary": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has made unprecedented advances in vision language models over the past two years. During the generative process, new samples (images) are generated from an unknown high-dimensional distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are particularly effective in drawing samples from such complex, high-dimensional distributions. This makes MCMC methods an integral component for models like EBMs, ensuring accurate sample generation. Gradient-based optimization is at the core of modern generative models. The update step during the optimization forms a Markov chain where the new update depends only on the current state. This allows exploration of the parameter space in a memoryless manner, thus combining the benefits of gradient-based optimization and MCMC sampling. MCMC methods have shown an equally important role in physically based rendering where complex light paths are otherwise quite challenging to sample from simple importance sampling techniques. A lot of research is dedicated towards bringing physical realism to samples (images) generated from diffusion-based generative models in a data-driven manner, however, a unified framework connecting these techniques is still missing. In this course, we take the first steps toward understanding each of these components and exploring how MCMC could potentially serve as a bridge, linking these closely related areas of research. Our course aims to provide necessary theoretical and practical tools to guide students, researchers and practitioners towards the common goal of generative physically based rendering.

Next, MEA (Multiblock Embedding Alignment) refines these representations by projecting them into a joint discriminative latent subspace that maximizes covariance with the original speech input. The learned EDRL-MEA embeddings are subsequently used to train an emotion classifier using clean samples from publicly available datasets, and are evaluated on unseen noisy and cross-corpus speech samples.

These challenges include the scarcity of high-quality datasets, multilingual inconsistencies, and safety concerns. Existing multilingual LLMs often address these issues by translating large volumes of available data. However, such translations often lack quality and cultural nuance while also incurring significant costs for data curation and training. To address these issues, we propose Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, a multilingual Urdu-English model, that tackles these challenges with a unique approach. We train the model on a high-quality, multilingual synthetic dataset (Urdu-Instruct), developed using a modified self-instruct technique. By using unique prompts and seed values for each task along with a global task pool, this dataset incorporates Urdu-native chain-of-thought based reasoning, bilingual translation, cultural relevance, and ethical safety alignments. This technique significantly enhances the comprehension of Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct model for Urdu-specific tasks. As a result, Alif-1.0-8B-Instruct, built upon the pretrained Llama-3.1-8B, demonstrates superior performance compared to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct for Urdu specific-tasks. It also outperformed leading multilingual LLMs, including Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3, Qwen-2.5-7B-Instruct, and Cohere-Aya-Expanse-8B, all within a training budget of under $100.

Prior GUI agents compress past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \\$4000 and fine-tune only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\\% parameters) with 1,500 samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts.

        "summary": "Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL) and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data. We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and 52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks.

        "summary": "State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity, and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process. We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows, and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code, data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.",

However, it poses risks of copyright infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness, imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.",

Aerial drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small, occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds, environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios, bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.",

We address this limitation by enforcing physical validity as a strict constraint during both training and inference with a uniffed module. At its core is a differentiable projection that maps the provisional atom coordinates from the diffusion model to the nearest physically valid conffguration. This projection is achieved using a Gauss-Seidel scheme, which exploits the locality and sparsity of the constraints to ensure stable and fast convergence at scale. By implicit differentiation to obtain gradients, our module integrates seamlessly into existing frameworks for end-to-end ffnetuning. With our Gauss-Seidel projection module in place, two denoising steps are sufffcient to produce biomolecular complexes that are both physically valid and structurally accurate. Across six benchmarks, our 2-step model achieves the same structural accuracy as state-of-the-art 200-step diffusion baselines, delivering approximately 10 times faster wall-clock speed while guaranteeing physical validity.",

We provide theoretical guarantees, including spatial Lipschitzness and temporal regularity of the velocity field, Wasserstein convergence rates for flow matching with Student-$t$ priors and primal-space guarantees for constrained generation, under $\\varepsilon$-accurate learned velocity fields.

Recent works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP, which employs an $\\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the $\\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the embedding space.",

Its significance lies in converting inherently infinite-dimensional optimization problems into finite-dimensional ones over dual coefficients, thereby enabling practical and computationally tractable algorithms. In this paper, we address the problem of estimating the latent triggering kernels--functions that encode the interaction structure between events--for linear multivariate Hawkes processes based on observed event sequences within an RKHS framework. We show that, under the principle of penalized least squares minimization, a novel form of representer theorem emerges: a family of transformed kernels can be defined via a system of simultaneous integral equations, and the optimal estimator of each triggering kernel is expressed as a linear combination of these transformed kernels evaluated at the data points. Remarkably, the dual coefficients are all analytically fixed to unity, obviating the need to solve a costly optimization problem to obtain the dual coefficients. This leads to a highly efficient estimator capable of handling large-scale data more effectively than conventional nonparametric approaches. Empirical evaluations on synthetic datasets reveal that the proposed method attains competitive predictive accuracy while substantially improving computational efficiency over existing state-of-the-art kernel method-based estimators.",

We introduce Gradient Guided Furthest Point Sampling (GGFPS), a simple extension of Furthest Point Sampling (FPS) that leverages molecular force norms to guide efficient sampling of configurational spaces of molecules. Numerical evidence is presented for a toy-system (Styblinski-Tang function) as well as for molecular dynamics trajectories from the MD17 dataset. Compared to FPS and uniform sampling, our numerical results indicate superior data efficiency and robustness when using GGFPS. Distribution analysis of the MD17 data suggests that FPS systematically under-samples equilibrium geometries, resulting in large test errors for relaxed structures. GGFPS cures this artifact and (i) enables up to two fold reductions in training cost without sacrificing predictive accuracy compared to FPS in the 2-dimensional Styblinksi-Tang system, (ii) systematically lowers prediction errors for equilibrium as well as strained structures in MD17, and (iii) systematically decreases prediction error variances across all of the MD17 configuration spaces. These results suggest that gradient-aware sampling methods hold great promise as effective training set selection tools, and that naive use of FPS may result in imbalanced training and inconsistent prediction outcomes.",

Due to the context-dependent nature of attacks, however, current defenses are often ill-calibrated as they cannot reliably differentiate malicious and benign instructions, leading to high false positive rates that prevent their real-world adoption. To address this, we present a novel approach inspired by the fundamental principle of computer security: data should not contain executable instructions. Instead of sample-level classification, we propose a token-level sanitization process, which surgically removes any instructions directed at AI systems from tool outputs, capturing malicious instructions as a byproduct. In contrast to existing safety classifiers, this approach is non-blocking, does not require calibration, and is agnostic to the context of tool outputs. Further, we can train such token-level predictors with readily available instruction-tuning data only, and don't have to rely on unrealistic prompt injection examples from challenges or of other synthetic origin. In our experiments, we find that this approach generalizes well across a wide range of attacks and benchmarks like AgentDojo, BIPIA, InjecAgent, ASB and SEP, achieving a 7-10x reduction of attack success rate (ASR) (34% to 3% on AgentDojo), without impairing agent utility in both benign and malicious settings.",

However, the majority of current robot learning datasets and benchmarks mainly focus on stationary robot arms, and the few existing humanoid datasets are either confined to fixed environments or limited in task diversity, often lacking human-humanoid interaction and lower-body locomotion. Moreover, there are a few standardized evaluation platforms for benchmarking learning-based policies on humanoid data. In this work, we present Humanoid Everyday, a large-scale and diverse humanoid manipulation dataset characterized by extensive task variety involving dextrous object manipulation, human-humanoid interaction, locomotion-integrated actions, and more. Leveraging a highly efficient human-supervised teleoperation pipeline, Humanoid Everyday aggregates high-quality multimodal sensory data, including RGB, depth, LiDAR, and tactile inputs, together with natural language annotations, comprising 10.3k trajectories and over 3 million frames of data across 260 tasks across 7 broad categories. In addition, we conduct an analysis of representative policy learning methods on our dataset, providing insights into their strengths and limitations across different task categories. For standardized evaluation, we introduce a cloud-based evaluation platform that allows researchers to seamlessly deploy their policies in our controlled setting and receive performance feedback. By releasing Humanoid Everyday along with our policy learning analysis and a standardized cloud-based evaluation platform, we intend to advance research in general-purpose humanoid manipulation and lay the groundwork for more capable and embodied robotic agents in real-world scenarios.

To take advantage of this, we propose SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation.

However, existing Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) frameworks focus primarily on profit optimization without explicitly accounting for service delay, potentially leading to QoS violations for latency-sensitive slices. Moreover, commonly used epsilon-greedy exploration of DRL often results in unstable convergence and suboptimal policy learning. To address these gaps, we propose DePSAC -- a Delay and Profit-aware Slice Admission Control scheme. Our DRL-based approach incorporates a delay-aware reward function, where penalties due to service delay incentivize the prioritization of latency-critical slices such as URLLC. Additionally, we employ Boltzmann exploration to achieve smoother and faster convergence. We implement and evaluate DePSAC on a simulated 5G core network substrate with realistic Network Slice Request (NSLR) arrival patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the DSARA baseline in terms of overall profit, reduced URLLC slice delays, improved acceptance rates, and improved resource consumption. These findings validate the effectiveness of the proposed DePSAC in achieving better QoS-profit trade-offs for practical 5G network slicing scenarios.",

        "summary": "Many social science questions ask how linguistic properties causally affect an audience's attitudes and behaviors. Because text properties are often interlinked (e.g., angry reviews use profane language), we must control for possible latent confounding to isolate causal effects. Recent literature proposes adapting large language models (LLMs) to learn latent representations of text that successfully predict both treatment and the outcome. However, because the treatment is a component of the text, these deep learning methods risk learning representations that actually encode the treatment itself, inducing overlap bias. Rather than depending on post-hoc adjustments, we introduce a new experimental design that handles latent confounding, avoids the overlap issue, and unbiasedly estimates treatment effects. We apply this design in an experiment evaluating the persuasiveness of expressing humility in political communication. Methodologically, we demonstrate that LLM-based methods perform worse than even simple bag-of-words models using our real text and outcomes from our experiment. Substantively, we isolate the causal effect of expressing humility on the perceived persuasiveness of political statements, offering new insights on communication effects for social media platforms, policy makers, and social scientists.",

        "summary": "Micro-benchmarking offers a solution to the often prohibitive time and cost of language model development: evaluate on a very small subset of existing benchmarks. Can these micro-benchmarks, however, rank models as consistently as the full benchmarks they replace? And can they rank models more consistently than selecting a random subset of data points? In many scenarios, we find that the answer is no. We introduce a meta-evaluation measure for micro-benchmarking which investigates how well a micro-benchmark can rank two models as a function of their performance difference on the full benchmark. This approach can determine which model pairs can be ranked correctly by a micro-benchmark, allowing for a finer-grained analysis of the trade-off between micro-benchmark size and reliability. Prior work has suggested selecting as few as 10 examples; we find that no micro-benchmarking method can consistently rank model pairs 3.5 points of accuracy apart on MMLU-Pro or 4 points apart on BIG-bench Hard. In order to consistently rank model pairs with relatively similar performances, we show that often as many as 250 examples must be selected, at which point random sampling is competitive with existing micro-benchmarking methods. When comparing only 8B instruction-tuned models on MMLU-Pro micro-benchmarks with 25 examples, we find that more than half of pairwise comparisons are not likely to be preserved. Our work provides actionable guidance for both micro-benchmark users and developers in navigating the trade-off between evaluation efficiency and reliability.",

While this approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization (SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established benchmarks.",

Neptune presents a new approach for advanced operator fusion, which intentionally breaks some existing dependencies and compensates by constructing algebraic correction expressions that allow the kernel to produce the correct result. On ten attention-based benchmarks, Neptune, starting from simple attention code and a high-level scheduling template, outperforms existing compilers like Triton, TVM, and FlexAttention, including Triton-based implementations of FlashAttention. Across four different GPU architectures from NVIDIA and AMD, Neptune-generated kernels have average speedup of $1.35\\times$ over the next best alternative, demonstrating its effectiveness for deep learning workloads.",

Phylogenetic trees capture evolutionary relationships among isolates and provide a natural framework for detecting such adaptive signals. We present a phylogeny-guided graph attention network (GAT) approach, introducing a method for converting SNP-annotated phylogenetic trees into graph structures suitable for neural network analysis. Using 500 M. tuberculosis isolates from four major lineages and 249 single-nucleotide variants (84 resistance-associated and 165 neutral) across 61 drug-resistance genes, we constructed graphs where nodes represented isolates and edges reflected phylogenetic distances. Edges between isolates separated by more than seven internal nodes were pruned to emphasise local evolutionary structure. Node features encoded SNP presence or absence, and the GAT architecture included two attention layers, a residual connection, global attention pooling, and a multilayer perceptron classifier. The model achieved an accuracy of 0.88 on a held-out test set and, when applied to 146 WHO-classified \"uncertain\" variants, identified 41 candidates with convergent emergence across multiple lineages, consistent with adaptive evolution. This work demonstrates the feasibility of transforming phylogenies into GNN-compatible structures and highlights attention-based models as effective tools for detecting positive selection, aiding genomic surveillance and variant prioritisation.",

This paper introduces a quantum-inspired variant of the KAN based on Quantum Data Re-uploading~(DR) models. The Quantum-Inspired Re-uploading KAN or QuIRK model replaces B-Splines with single-qubit DR models as the univariate function approximator, allowing them to match or outperform traditional KANs while using even fewer parameters. This is especially apparent in the case of periodic functions. Additionally, since the model utilizes only single-qubit circuits, it remains classically tractable to simulate with straightforward GPU acceleration. Finally, we also demonstrate that QuIRK retains the interpretability advantages and the ability to produce closed-form solutions.",

HDLM builds on a hierarchical vocabulary where low-level tokens with detailed semantics are surjectively mapped to high-level tokens with coarse-grained meanings. In the forward process, each token is independently perturbed to its higher-level ancestor with more abstract semantics according to the scheduler, while in the reverse process the model progressively predicts the next, more detailed semantics. Taken together, HDLM provides a general time-varying next semantic scale prediction process for language modeling. We derive closed-form expressions for the diffusion Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO), and show that HDLM can be implemented in a flexible manner while including the existing MDLM as a special case. We also propose practical training techniques based on the insights. Extensive text generation experiments validate the effectiveness of HDLM, which demonstrates consistently lower validation and generative perplexity than baselines.",

While supervised OOD detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\\% improvement in AUROC, 22\\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\\% to 40\\%), compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.",

Recent approaches apply large language models directly to extraction tasks using existing JSON schemas, often with constraint decoding or reinforcement learning approaches to ensure syntactic validity, but treat JSON schemas as static contracts designed for human developers, leading to suboptimal extraction performance, frequent hallucinations, and unreliable agent behavior when schemas contain ambiguous or incomplete specifications. We recognize that JSON schemas themselves are a form of natural language understanding contract that encodes rules, relationships, and expectations about data structure contracts that LLMs should be able to both interpret and systematically improve. Consequently, we develop PARSE (Parameter Automated Refinement and Schema Extraction), a novel system with two synergistic components: ARCHITECT, which autonomously optimizes JSON schemas for LLM consumption while maintaining backward compatibility through RELAY (an integrated code generation system), and SCOPE, which implements reflection-based extraction with combined static and LLM-based guardrails. We evaluate PARSE qualitatively and quantitatively on three datasets including Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD), Structured Web Data Extraction (SWDE), and internal retail conversation data, and find that it achieves up to 64.7% improvement in extraction accuracy on SWDE with combined framework improvements reaching 10% across models, while reducing extraction errors by 92% within the first retry and and maintaining practical latency.",

On the other hand, \\emph{floating} can be used to automatically get bug fixes and security fixes, but comes with the risk of breaking changes. Security practitioners advocate \\emph{pinning} dependencies to prevent against software supply chain attacks, e.g., malicious package updates. However, since \\emph{pinning} is the tightest version constraint, \\emph{pinning} is the most likely to result in outdated dependencies. Nevertheless, how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable dependencies changes across version constraint types is unknown. The goal of this study is to aid developers in making an informed dependency version constraint choice by empirically evaluating the likelihood of dependencies becoming outdated or vulnerable across version constraint types at scale. In this study, we first identify the trends in dependency version constraint usage and the patterns of version constraint type changes made by developers in the npm, PyPI, and Cargo ecosystems. We then modeled the dependency state transitions using survival analysis and estimated how the likelihood of becoming outdated or vulnerable changes when using \\emph{pinning} as opposed to the rest of the version constraint types. We observe that among outdated and vulnerable dependencies, the most commonly used version constraint type is \\emph{floating-minor}, with \\emph{pinning} being the next most common.

Automated jailbreaks typically optimize an adversarial suffix or adapt long prompt templates by forcing the model to generate the initial part of a restricted or harmful response. In this work, we show that existing jailbreak attacks that leverage such mechanisms to unlock the model response can be detected by a straightforward perplexity-based filtering on the input prompt. To overcome this issue, we propose LatentBreak, a white-box jailbreak attack that generates natural adversarial prompts with low perplexity capable of evading such defenses. LatentBreak substitutes words in the input prompt with semantically-equivalent ones, preserving the initial intent of the prompt, instead of adding high-perplexity adversarial suffixes or long templates. These words are chosen by minimizing the distance in the latent space between the representation of the adversarial prompt and that of harmless requests. Our extensive evaluation shows that LatentBreak leads to shorter and low-perplexity prompts, thus outperforming competing jailbreak algorithms against perplexity-based filters on multiple safety-aligned models.",

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, and Claude has significantly increased the presence of AI-generated text in digital communication. This trend has heightened the need for reliable detection methods to distinguish between human-authored and machine-generated content. Existing approaches both zero-shot methods and supervised classifiers largely conceptualize this task as a binary classification problem, often leading to poor generalization across domains and models. In this paper, we argue that such a binary formulation fundamentally mischaracterizes the detection task by assuming a coherent representation of human-written texts. In reality, human texts do not constitute a unified distribution, and their diversity cannot be effectively captured through limited sampling. This causes previous classifiers to memorize observed OOD characteristics rather than learn the essence of `non-ID' behavior, limiting generalization to unseen human-authored inputs. Based on this observation, we propose reframing the detection task as an out-of-distribution (OOD) detection problem, treating human-written texts as distributional outliers while machine-generated texts are in-distribution (ID) samples. To this end, we develop a detection framework using one-class learning method including DeepSVDD and HRN, and score-based learning techniques such as energy-based method, enabling robust and generalizable performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets validate the effectiveness of our OOD-based approach. Specifically, the OOD-based method achieves 98.3% AUROC and AUPR with only 8.9% FPR95 on DeepFake dataset. Moreover, we test our detection framework on multilingual, attacked, and unseen-model and -domain text settings, demonstrating the robustness and generalizability of our framework.

        "summary": "Inference optimizations such as quantization, pruning, format and datatype conversion, model export, and serialization can lead to functional degradations in language model task performance. While most efforts on performance recovery for deployment focus on robust quantization techniques, we focus on recovering model accuracies from any sources that degrade model weights, such as improper model serialization. In this work, we propose Recover-LoRA, a lightweight and dataset agnostic method to recover accuracy in degraded models. Recover-LoRA uses synthetic data and logit distillation to learn LoRA adapters on selective layers that facilitate aligning the degraded model to its full precision model. We investigate the utility of Recover-LoRA across a diverse set of small language models (SLMs), including models with varying attention architectures, multi-head attention (MHA) and group-query attention (GQA), as well as several evaluation datasets. Our results show that Recover-LoRA recovers model accuracies by 5-17% on MHA and GQA SLMs.",

        "summary": "Test-Time Scaling (TTS) improves LLM reasoning by exploring multiple candidate responses and then operating over this set to find the best output. A tacit premise behind TTS is that sufficiently diverse candidate pools enhance reliability. In this work, we show that this assumption in TTS introduces a previously unrecognized failure mode. When candidate diversity is curtailed, even by a modest amount, TTS becomes much more likely to produce unsafe outputs. We present a reference-guided diversity reduction protocol (RefDiv) that serves as a diagnostic attack to stress test TTS pipelines. Through extensive experiments across four open-source models (Qwen3, Mistral, Llama3.1, Gemma3) and two widely used TTS strategies (Monte Carlo Tree Search and Best-of-N), constraining diversity consistently signifies the rate at which TTS produces unsafe results. The effect is often stronger than that produced by prompts directly with high adversarial intent scores. This observed phenomenon also transfers across TTS strategies and to closed-source models (e.g. OpenAI o3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro), thus indicating that this is a general and extant property of TTS rather than a model-specific artifact. Additionally, we find that numerous widely used safety guardrail classifiers (e.g. Llama-Guard and OpenAI Moderation API), are unable to flag the adversarial input prompts generated by RefDiv, demonstrating that existing defenses offer limited protection against this diversity-driven failure mode. Through this work, we hope to motivate future research on designing robust TTS strategies that are both effective and secure against diversity-targeted stress tests as illustrated by RefDiv.",

        "summary": "Recent advancements in QML and SNNs have generated considerable excitement, promising exponential speedups and brain-like energy efficiency to revolutionize AI. However, this paper argues that they are unlikely to displace DNNs in the near term. QML struggles with adapting backpropagation due to unitary constraints, measurement-induced state collapse, barren plateaus, and high measurement overheads, exacerbated by the limitations of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum hardware, overfitting risks due to underdeveloped regularization techniques, and a fundamental misalignment with machine learning's generalization. SNNs face restricted representational bandwidth, struggling with long-range dependencies and semantic encoding in language tasks due to their discrete, spike-based processing. Furthermore, the goal of faithfully emulating the brain might impose inherent inefficiencies like cognitive biases, limited working memory, and slow learning speeds. Even their touted energy-efficient advantages are overstated; optimized DNNs with quantization can outperform SNNs in energy costs under realistic conditions. Finally, SNN training incurs high computational overhead from temporal unfolding. In contrast, DNNs leverage efficient backpropagation, robust regularization, and innovations in LRMs that shift scaling to inference-time compute, enabling self-improvement via RL and search algorithms like MCTS while mitigating data scarcity. This superiority is evidenced by recent models such as xAI's Grok-4 Heavy, which advances SOTA performance, and gpt-oss-120b, which surpasses or approaches the performance of leading industry models despite its modest 120-billion-parameter size deployable on a single 80GB GPU. Furthermore, specialized ASICs amplify these efficiency gains. Ultimately, QML and SNNs may serve niche hybrid roles, but DNNs remain the dominant, practical paradigm for AI advancement.",

        "summary": "Generative AI (GenAI) has achieved remarkable success across a range of domains, but its capabilities remain constrained to statistical models of finite training sets and learning based on local gradient signals. This often results in artifacts that are more derivative than genuinely generative. In contrast, Evolutionary Computation (EC) offers a search-driven pathway to greater diversity and creativity, expanding generative capabilities by exploring uncharted solution spaces beyond the limits of available data. This work establishes a fundamental connection between EC and GenAI, redefining EC as Natural Generative AI (NatGenAI) -- a generative paradigm governed by exploratory search under natural selection. We demonstrate that classical EC with parent-centric operators mirrors conventional GenAI, while disruptive operators enable structured evolutionary leaps, often within just a few generations, to generate out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, the methods of evolutionary multitasking provide an unparalleled means of integrating disruptive EC (with cross-domain recombination of evolved features) and moderated selection mechanisms (allowing novel solutions to survive), thereby fostering sustained innovation. By reframing EC as NatGenAI, we emphasize structured disruption and selection pressure moderation as essential drivers of creativity. This perspective extends the generative paradigm beyond conventional boundaries and positions EC as crucial to advancing exploratory design, innovation, scientific discovery, and open-ended generation in the GenAI era.",

        "summary": "Electroencephalography (EEG)-based Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have emerged as a transformative technology with applications spanning robotics, virtual reality, medicine, and rehabilitation. However, existing BCI frameworks face several limitations, including a lack of stage-wise flexibility essential for experimental research, steep learning curves for researchers without programming expertise, elevated costs due to reliance on proprietary software, and a lack of all-inclusive features leading to the use of multiple external tools affecting research outcomes. To address these challenges, we present PyNoetic, a modular BCI framework designed to cater to the diverse needs of BCI research. PyNoetic is one of the very few frameworks in Python that encompasses the entire BCI design pipeline, from stimulus presentation and data acquisition to channel selection, filtering, feature extraction, artifact removal, and finally simulation and visualization. Notably, PyNoetic introduces an intuitive and end-to-end GUI coupled with a unique pick-and-place configurable flowchart for no-code BCI design, making it accessible to researchers with minimal programming experience. For advanced users, it facilitates the seamless integration of custom functionalities and novel algorithms with minimal coding, ensuring adaptability at each design stage. PyNoetic also includes a rich array of analytical tools such as machine learning models, brain-connectivity indices, systematic testing functionalities via simulation, and evaluation methods of novel paradigms. PyNoetic's strengths lie in its versatility for both offline and real-time BCI development, which streamlines the design process, allowing researchers to focus on more intricate aspects of BCI development and thus accelerate their research endeavors.

Enabling SLMs to think while speaking, similar to humans, is attracting increasing attention. We present, for the first time, Mind-Paced Speaking (MPS), a brain-inspired framework that enables high-fidelity, real-time reasoning. Similar to how humans utilize distinct brain regions for thinking and responding, we propose a novel dual-brain approach, employing a \"Formulation Brain\" for high-level reasoning to pace and guide a separate \"Articulation Brain\" for fluent speech generation. This division of labor eliminates mode-switching, preserving the integrity of the reasoning process. Experiments show that MPS significantly outperforms existing think-while-speaking methods and achieves reasoning performance comparable to models that pre-compute the full CoT before speaking, while drastically reducing latency. Under a zero-latency configuration, the proposed method achieves an accuracy of 92.8% on the mathematical reasoning task Spoken-MQA and attains a score of 82.5 on the speech conversation task URO-Bench.

        "summary": "Reasoning models have recently shown remarkable progress in domains such as math and coding. However, their expert-level abilities in math and coding contrast sharply with their performance in long-horizon, interactive tasks such as web navigation and computer/phone-use. Inspired by literature on human cognition, we argue that current AI agents need ''vicarious trial and error'' - the capacity to mentally simulate alternative futures before acting - in order to enhance their understanding and performance in complex interactive environments. We introduce Dyna-Mind, a two-stage training framework that explicitly teaches (V)LM agents to integrate such simulation into their reasoning. In stage 1, we introduce Reasoning with Simulations (ReSim), which trains the agent to generate structured reasoning traces from expanded search trees built from real experience gathered through environment interactions. ReSim thus grounds the agent's reasoning in faithful world dynamics and equips it with the ability to anticipate future states in its reasoning. In stage 2, we propose Dyna-GRPO, an online reinforcement learning method to further strengthen the agent's simulation and decision-making ability by using both outcome rewards and intermediate states as feedback from real rollouts. Experiments on two synthetic benchmarks (Sokoban and ALFWorld) and one realistic benchmark (AndroidWorld) demonstrate that (1) ReSim effectively infuses simulation ability into AI agents, and (2) Dyna-GRPO leverages outcome and interaction-level signals to learn better policies for long-horizon, planning-intensive tasks. Together, these results highlight the central role of simulation in enabling AI agents to reason, plan, and act more effectively in the ever more challenging environments.",

To enable rigorous evaluation, we release PRBench, a multimodal benchmark that links 512 peer-reviewed articles to high-quality promotional posts, assessing systems along three axes: Fidelity (accuracy and tone), Engagement (audience targeting and appeal), and Alignment (timing and channel optimization). We also introduce PRAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates AutoPR in three stages: content extraction with multimodal preparation, collaborative synthesis for polished outputs, and platform-specific adaptation to optimize norms, tone, and tagging for maximum reach. When compared to direct LLM pipelines on PRBench, PRAgent demonstrates substantial improvements, including a 604% increase in total watch time, a 438% rise in likes, and at least a 2.9x boost in overall engagement. Ablation studies show that platform modeling and targeted promotion contribute the most to these gains.

To this end, we present WUGNECTIVES, a dataset of 8,880 stimuli that evaluates LMs' inferences about novel entities in contexts where connectives link the entities to particular attributes. On investigating 17 different LMs at various scales, and training regimens, we found that tuning an LM to show reasoning behavior yields noteworthy improvements on most connectives. At the same time, there was a large variation in LMs' overall performance across connective type, with all models systematically struggling on connectives that express a concessive meaning. Our findings pave the way for more nuanced investigations into the functional role of language cues as captured by LMs. We release WUGNECTIVES at https://github.com/sheffwb/wugnectives.",

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of multilingual CoT reasoning, evaluating three key dimensions: performance, consistency, and faithfulness. We begin by measuring language compliance, answer accuracy, and answer consistency when LRMs are explicitly instructed or prompt-hacked to think in a target language, revealing strong language preferences and divergent performance across languages. Next, we assess crosslingual consistency of thinking traces by interchanging them between languages. We find that the quality and effectiveness of thinking traces vary substantially depending on the prompt language. Finally, we adapt perturbation-based techniques -- i.e., truncation and error injection -- to probe the faithfulness of thinking traces across languages, showing that models rely on traces to varying degrees.

Video subtitles are divided into semantically coherent chunks, enriched with concise knowledge-graph (KG) facts, and organized into a hierarchical tree whose node embeddings are generated by a language-agnostic multilingual encoder. At query time, the same encoder embeds the input question; a coarse-to-fine tree search prunes irrelevant branches, and only the top-ranked chunks are re-scored by a lightweight large language model (LLM). This design avoids exhaustive cross-encoder scoring while preserving chunk-level precision. Experiments on the mVCR test set demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, and ablation studies confirm the complementary contributions of KG enrichment, hierarchical indexing, and targeted LLM re-ranking.

However, parallel decoding, which enables simultaneous token updates, conflicts with the causal order often required for rigorous reasoning. We first identify this conflict as the core Parallel-Sequential Contradiction (PSC). Behavioral analyses in both simple and complex reasoning tasks show that DLLMs exhibit genuine parallelism only for directly decidable outputs. As task difficulty increases, they revert to autoregressive-like behavior, a limitation exacerbated by autoregressive prompting, which nearly doubles the number of decoding steps with remasking without improving quality. Moreover, PSC restricts DLLMs' self-reflection, reasoning depth, and exploratory breadth. To further characterize PSC, we introduce three scaling dimensions for DLLMs: parallel, diffusion, and sequential. Empirically, while parallel scaling yields consistent improvements, diffusion and sequential scaling are constrained by PSC. Based on these findings, we propose several practical mitigations, parallel-oriented prompting, diffusion early stopping, and parallel scaling, to reduce PSC-induced ineffectiveness and inefficiencies.",

While prior work uses surrogates like the evidence lower bound (ELBO), these one-sided approximations can introduce significant policy gradient bias. To address this, we propose the Sandwiched Policy Gradient (SPG) that leverages both an upper and a lower bound of the true log-likelihood. Experiments show that SPG significantly outperforms baselines based on ELBO or one-step estimation. Specifically, SPG improves the accuracy over state-of-the-art RL methods for dLLMs by 3.6% in GSM8K, 2.6% in MATH500, 18.4% in Countdown and 27.0% in Sudoku.",

We evaluate 18 open-source LLMs across three model families and five downstream tasks spanning language inference, multi-choice question answering, mathematical reasoning, and machine translation tasks. Our results show that typos consistently degrade performance, particularly in generative tasks and those requiring reasoning -- while the natural language inference task is comparatively more robust. Instruction tuning improves clean-input performance but may increase brittleness under noise.

In this paper, we argue that the granularity of supervision plays a crucial role in balancing efficiency and accuracy, and propose Group Relative Segment Penalization (GRSP), a step-level method to regularize reasoning. Since preliminary analyses show that reasoning segments are strongly correlated with token consumption and model performance, we design a length-aware weighting mechanism across segment clusters.

        "summary": "Pre-trained transformer-based models have significantly advanced automatic speech recognition (ASR), yet they remain sensitive to accent and dialectal variations, resulting in elevated word error rates (WER) in linguistically diverse languages such as English and Persian. To address this challenge, we propose an accent-invariant ASR framework that integrates accent and dialect classification into the recognition pipeline. Our approach involves training a spectrogram-based classifier to capture accent-specific cues, masking the regions most influential to its predictions, and using the masked spectrograms for data augmentation. This enhances the robustness of ASR models against accent variability. We evaluate the method using both English and Persian speech. For Persian, we introduce a newly collected dataset spanning multiple regional accents, establishing the first systematic benchmark for accent variation in Persian ASR that fills a critical gap in multilingual speech research and provides a foundation for future studies on low-resource, linguistically diverse languages. Experimental results with the Whisper model demonstrate that our masking and augmentation strategy yields substantial WER reductions in both English and Persian settings, confirming the effectiveness of the approach. This research advances the development of multilingual ASR systems that are resilient to accent and dialect diversity.

While prior work has proposed measures based on dataset similarity or predicted correctness, it remains unclear when these estimates produce reliable performance rankings across domains. In this paper, we analyze the factors that affect ranking reliability using a two-step evaluation setup with four base classifiers and several large language models as error predictors. Experiments on the GeoOLID and Amazon Reviews datasets, spanning 15 domains, show that large language model-based error predictors produce stronger and more consistent rank correlations with true accuracy than drift-based or zero-shot baselines. Our analysis reveals two key findings: ranking is more reliable when performance differences across domains are larger, and when the error model's predictions align with the base model's true failure patterns. These results clarify when performance estimation methods can be trusted and provide guidance for their use in cross-domain model evaluation.",

To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{StatEval}, the first comprehensive benchmark dedicated to statistics, spanning both breadth and depth across difficulty levels. StatEval consists of 13,817 foundational problems covering undergraduate and graduate curricula, together with 2374 research-level proof tasks extracted from leading journals. To construct the benchmark, we design a scalable multi-agent pipeline with human-in-the-loop validation that automates large-scale problem extraction, rewriting, and quality control, while ensuring academic rigor. We further propose a robust evaluation framework tailored to both computational and proof-based tasks, enabling fine-grained assessment of reasoning ability. Experimental results reveal that while closed-source models such as GPT5-mini achieve below 57\\% on research-level problems, with open-source models performing significantly lower. These findings highlight the unique challenges of statistical reasoning and the limitations of current LLMs. We expect StatEval to serve as a rigorous benchmark for advancing statistical intelligence in large language models.

        "summary": "Modern conversational agents like ChatGPT and Alexa+ rely on predefined policies specifying metadata, response styles, and tool-usage rules. As these LLM-based systems expand to support diverse business and user queries, such policies, often implemented as in-context prompts, are becoming increasingly complex and lengthy, making faithful adherence difficult and imposing large fixed computational costs. With the rise of multimodal agents, policies that govern visual and multimodal behaviors are critical but remain understudied. Prior prompt-compression work mainly shortens task templates and demonstrations, while existing policy-alignment studies focus only on text-based safety rules. We introduce Multimodal Policy Internalization (MPI), a new task that internalizes reasoning-intensive multimodal policies into model parameters, enabling stronger policy-following without including the policy during inference. MPI poses unique data and algorithmic challenges. We build two datasets spanning synthetic and real-world decision-making and tool-using tasks and propose TriMPI, a three-stage training framework. TriMPI first injects policy knowledge via continual pretraining, then performs supervised finetuning, and finally applies PolicyRollout, a GRPO-style reinforcement learning extension that augments rollouts with policy-aware responses for grounded exploration. TriMPI achieves notable gains in end-to-end accuracy, generalization, and robustness to forgetting. As the first work on multimodal policy internalization, we provide datasets, training recipes, and comprehensive evaluations to foster future research.

Despite the proliferation of open-weight LLMs, access to LLM training data has remained limited. Even for fully open LLMs, the scale of the data makes it all but inscrutable to the general scientific community, despite potentially containing critical data scraped from the internet. In this paper, we present the full-text indexing pipeline for the Apertus LLM training data. Leveraging Elasticsearch parallel indices and the Alps infrastructure, a state-of-the-art, highly energy-efficient arm64 supercluster, we were able to index 8.6T tokens out of 15.2T used to train the Apertus LLM family, creating both a critical LLM safety tool and effectively an offline, curated, open web search engine. Our contribution is threefold. First, we demonstrate that Elasticsearch can be successfully ported onto next-generation arm64-based infrastructure. Second, we demonstrate that full-text indexing at the scale of modern LLM training datasets and the entire open web is feasible and accessible. Finally, we demonstrate that such indices can be used to ensure previously inaccessible jailbreak-agnostic LLM safety. We hope that our findings will be useful to other teams attempting large-scale data indexing and facilitate the general transition towards greener computation.",

        "summary": "Free-text crash narratives recorded in real-world crash databases have been shown to play a significant role in improving traffic safety. However, large-scale analyses remain difficult to implement as there are no documented tools that can batch process the unstructured, non standardized text content written by various authors with diverse experience and attention to detail. In recent years, Transformer-based pre-trained language models (PLMs), such as Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) and large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities across various natural language processing tasks. These models can extract explicit facts from crash narratives, but their performance declines on inference-heavy tasks in, for example, Crash Type identification, which can involve nearly 100 categories. Moreover, relying on closed LLMs through external APIs raises privacy concerns for sensitive crash data. Additionally, these black-box tools often underperform due to limited domain knowledge. Motivated by these challenges, we study whether compact open-source PLMs can support reasoning-intensive extraction from crash narratives. We target two challenging objectives: 1) identifying the Manner of Collision for a crash, and 2) Crash Type for each vehicle involved in the crash event from real-world crash narratives. To bridge domain gaps, we apply fine-tuning techniques to inject task-specific knowledge to LLMs with Low-Rank Adaption (LoRA) and BERT. Experiments on the authoritative real-world dataset Crash Investigation Sampling System (CISS) demonstrate that our fine-tuned compact models outperform strong closed LLMs, such as GPT-4o, while requiring only minimal training resources. Further analysis reveals that the fine-tuned PLMs can capture richer narrative details and even correct some mislabeled annotations in the dataset.",

We introduce KORMo-10B, a 10.8B-parameter model trained from scratch on a Korean-English corpus in which 68.74% of the Korean portion is synthetic. Through systematic experimentation, we demonstrate that synthetic data, when carefully curated with balanced linguistic coverage and diverse instruction styles, does not cause instability or degradation during large-scale pretraining. Furthermore, the model achieves performance comparable to that of contemporary open-weight multilingual baselines across a wide range of reasoning, knowledge, and instruction-following benchmarks. Our experiments reveal two key findings: (1) synthetic data can reliably sustain long-horizon pretraining without model collapse, and (2) bilingual instruction tuning enables near-native reasoning and discourse coherence in Korean. By fully releasing all components including data, code, training recipes, and logs, this work establishes a transparent framework for developing synthetic data-driven fully open models (FOMs) in low-resource settings and sets a reproducible precedent for future multilingual LLM research.",

We introduce entity mention reconstruction as a novel framework for studying how LLMs encode and manipulate entities. We investigate whether entity mentions can be generated from internal representations, how multi-token entities are encoded beyond last-token embeddings, and whether these representations capture relational knowledge. Our proposed method, leveraging _task vectors_, allows to consistently generate multi-token mentions from various entity representations derived from the LLMs hidden states. We thus introduce the _Entity Lens_, extending the _logit-lens_ to predict multi-token mentions. Our results bring new evidence that LLMs develop entity-specific mechanisms to represent and manipulate any multi-token entities, including those unseen during training.

Current mainstream graph prompt-tuning methods modify input or output features using learnable prompt vectors. However, existing approaches are confined to single-granularity (e.g., node-level or subgraph-level) during prompt generation, overlooking the inherently multi-scale structural information in graph data, which limits the diversity of prompt semantics. To address this issue, we pioneer the integration of multi-scale information into graph prompt and propose a Multi-Scale Graph Chain-of-Thought (MSGCOT) prompting framework. Specifically, we design a lightweight, low-rank coarsening network to efficiently capture multi-scale structural features as hierarchical basis vectors for prompt generation. Subsequently, mimicking human cognition from coarse-to-fine granularity, we dynamically integrate multi-scale information at each reasoning step, forming a progressive coarse-to-fine prompt chain. Extensive experiments on eight benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSGCOT outperforms the state-of-the-art single-granularity graph prompt-tuning method, particularly in few-shot scenarios, showcasing superior performance.",

We present the first systematic study of domain-specific fine-tuning in large medical language models. Our analysis reveals that fine-tuning modifies only a small subset of the representational subspace, essentially preserving the pre-trained model's representation. To interpret these changes in subspaces, we propose tuning vectors, a novel framework inspired by task vectors, which explicitly capture the directional parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning. We demonstrate that these vectors are critical for enhancing both instruction-following and generation quality. Furthermore, combining tuning vectors across different domains yields improved generalisation. Upon closer inspection of directional alignment, we find these vectors primarily write new directional information into the MLP layers of the model, while amplifying existing directions in attention heads.

Nevertheless, its practical adoption is hindered by the laborious manual rule coding. Emerging Large Language Models (LLMs) present the immense potential for efficient rules generation. However, there is a critical gap that current research predominantly focuses on conceptual frameworks and lacks robust experimental validation. To bridge this gap, we propose \\textit{N}atural \\textit{L}anguage to \\textit{Gen}erative \\textit{Sym}bolic Rules (NL2GenSym), a novel framework that integrates LLMs with SOAR to autonomously produce generative symbolic rules from natural language. Specifically, our framework introduces a novel Execution-Grounded Generator-Critic mechanism. The LLM-based Generator, guided by a Retrieval-Augmented Generation-accessed self-evolving domain knowledge base, proposes rules from natural language. Subsequently, these rules are immediately executed within the SOAR environment to rigorously validate their correctness. Based on this execution-grounded feedback, a reflective LLM-based Critic drives the iterative refinement of these rules. Experiments on our specialized Water Jug Problem (WJP) dataset, utilizing both Gemini and Qwen series models, validate the efficacy of our framework. It achieves a success rate over 86\\% in generating rules from natural language. Crucially, the framework also generates novel heuristic rules, reducing average decision cycles for solving the WJP to 1.98 times the optimal solution and 1/1000 of baseline methods.

We then show that we can further boost its performance by training the guider model with preference optimization over correct/incorrect reasoning pairs sampled from both the target and guider model, a setup we refer to as ThinkLogit-DPO. Our experiments demonstrate that ThinkLogit and ThinkLogit-DPO achieve a relative improvement in average accuracy by 24.5% and 29.1%, respectively, over five reasoning benchmarks using the Qwen2.5-32B guided by R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, a model 21x smaller. Moreover, we find that ThinkLogit remains effective when the guider and target come from different model families. It is also orthogonal to post-training methods for small models, as guiders improved through supervised distillation or reinforcement learning can be directly plugged in to yield stronger large models, offering a practical path to unlock long reasoning in large-scale models without costly post-training.",

Therefore, numerous studies have been proposed for automating price prediction. However, most of them are based on static regression models, which suffer from poor generalization performance and fail to capture market dynamics (e.g., the price of a used iPhone decreases over time). Inspired by recent breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLMs), we introduce LLP, the first LLM-based generative framework for second-hand product pricing. LLP first retrieves similar products to better align with the dynamic market change. Afterwards, it leverages the LLMs' nuanced understanding of key pricing information in free-form text to generate accurate price suggestions. To strengthen the LLMs' domain reasoning over retrieved products, we apply a two-stage optimization, supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by group relative policy optimization (GRPO), on a dataset built via bidirectional reasoning. Moreover, LLP employs a confidence-based filtering mechanism to reject unreliable price suggestions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LLP substantially surpasses existing methods while generalizing well to unseen categories. We have successfully deployed LLP on Xianyu\\footnote\\{Xianyu is China's largest second-hand e-commerce platform.\\}, significantly outperforming the previous pricing method.

        "summary": "Although large language models (LLM) have achieved remarkable performance, their enormous parameter counts hinder deployment on resource-constrained hardware. Low-rank compression can reduce both memory usage and computational demand, but applying a uniform compression ratio across all layers often leads to significant performance degradation, and previous methods perform poorly during decoding. To address these issues, we propose the Fine-grained Low-Rank Compressor (FLRC), which efficiently determines an optimal rank allocation for each layer, and incorporates progressive low-rank decoding to maintain text generation quality. Comprehensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of FLRC, achieving up to a 17% improvement in ROUGE-L on summarization tasks compared to state-of-the-art low-rank compression methods, establishing a more robust and efficient framework to improve LLM inference.",

        "summary": "Diffusion large language models (dLLMs) present a promising alternative to dominant autoregressive models (ARMs) by the ability of parallel decoding at the expense of substantial computation and memory costs. Specifically, the cache mechanism for bidirectional attention in dLLMs demands large memory footprint, restricting their ability to handle long contexts under resource-limited settings. Existing cache eviction strategies are designed for ARMs and ignore the unique characteristics of dLLMs, thus leading to unsatisfactory performance. To address these challenges, we introduce MaskKV, a training-free cache eviction framework tailored to dLLMs, focusing on the effect of mask tokens in dLLMs. MaskKV is built on two key innovations: (1) a mask-query guided scoring mechanism that leverages attention weights to identify and evict less critical prompt tokens for each head; (2) an adaptive cache budgeting strategy that improves efficiency by reducing allocation in intermediate layers and concentrating resources on prompt-preferring heads. On LLaDA with MaskKV, compressing the KV cache to only 256 pairs (less than 5% of tokens) retains 94% of the full-cache performance on LongBench and achieves up to 31x acceleration at 32k prompt length.

To counteract both sources of noise, we introduce \\textbf{MaP}, a dual-pronged framework that synergistically integrates checkpoint \\underline{M}erging \\underline{a}nd the \\underline{P}ass@k metric. Checkpoint merging smooths the parameter space by averaging recent model weights, while Pass@k provides a robust, low-variance statistical estimate of model capability. Extensive experiments show that MaP yields significantly smoother performance curves, reduces inter-run variance, and ensures more consistent model rankings. Ultimately, MaP provides a more reliable and faithful lens for observing LLM training dynamics, laying a crucial empirical foundation for LLM research.",

However, standard outcome-based reinforcement learning (RL) on MCQs is risky. While it may improve accuracy, we observe it often degrades reasoning quality such as logical consistency. Existing solutions to supervise reasoning, such as large-scale Process Reward Models (PRMs), are prohibitively expensive. To address this, we propose CLARity, a cost-effective RL framework that enhances reasoning quality using only a small, general-purpose LLM. CLARity integrates a consistency-aware reward mechanism with a 2-stage refine-then-monitor training pipeline to enhance reasoning consistency, and a dynamic data reformulation strategy to to better exploit limited data. Experiments demonstrate that CLARity improves response consistency by 16.5% and accuracy by 7.5% over baselines. Human evaluations further confirm holistic improvements in coherence and professionalism. Thus, CLARity offers a generalizable solution that enables smaller models to effectively guide expert models by reasoning consistency.Our code is open sourced at: https://github.com/Infinite-set/CLARity",

However, current evaluations of large language models (LLMs) are fundamentally misaligned with real-world clinical practice. Most of them rely on static benchmarks derived from public medical exam items, which tend to overestimate model performance and ignore the difference between textbook cases and the ambiguous, varying conditions in the real world. Recent efforts toward dynamic evaluation offer a promising alternative, but their improvements are limited to superficial perturbations and a narrow focus on accuracy. To address these gaps, we propose DyReMe, a dynamic benchmark for medical diagnostics that better reflects real clinical practice. Unlike static exam-style questions, DyReMe generates fresh, consultation-like cases that introduce distractors such as differential diagnoses and common misdiagnosis factors. It also varies expression styles to mimic diverse real-world query habits. Beyond accuracy, DyReMe evaluates LLMs on three additional clinically relevant dimensions: veracity, helpfulness, and consistency. Our experiments demonstrate that this dynamic approach yields more challenging and realistic assessments, revealing significant misalignments between the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs and real clinical practice. These findings highlight the urgent need for evaluation frameworks that better reflect the demands of trustworthy medical diagnostics.",

To address these gaps, we introduce CFVBench, a large-scale, manually verified benchmark constructed from 599 publicly available videos, yielding 5,360 open-ended QA pairs. CFVBench spans high-density formats and domains such as chart-heavy reports, news broadcasts, and software tutorials, requiring models to retrieve and reason over long temporal video spans while maintaining fine-grained multimodal information. Using CFVBench, we systematically evaluate 7 retrieval methods and 14 widely-used MLLMs, revealing a critical bottleneck: current models (even GPT5 or Gemini) struggle to capture transient yet essential fine-grained multimodal details. To mitigate this, we propose Adaptive Visual Refinement (AVR), a simple yet effective framework that adaptively increases frame sampling density and selectively invokes external tools when necessary.

To tackle these challenges, AI has been used in assisting humans in emergency situations. Still, the use of NLP techniques remains limited and mostly focuses on classification tasks. The significant potential of timely warning message generation using NLG architectures, however, has been largely overlooked. In this paper we present CrisiText, the first large-scale dataset for the generation of warning messages across 13 different types of crisis scenarios. The dataset contains more than 400,000 warning messages (spanning almost 18,000 crisis situations) aimed at assisting civilians during and after such events. To generate the dataset, we started from existing crisis descriptions and created chains of events related to the scenarios. Each event was then paired with a warning message. The generations follow experts' written guidelines to ensure correct terminology and factuality of their suggestions. Additionally, each message is accompanied by three suboptimal warning types to allow for the study of different NLG approaches. To this end, we conducted a series of experiments comparing supervised fine-tuning setups with preference alignment, zero-shot, and few-shot approaches. We further assessed model performance in out-of-distribution scenarios and evaluated the effectiveness of an automatic post-editor.",

DICE decouples the process by first prompting LLMs to generate natural language responses, then using trained SLMs to analyze and refine these outputs to meet structured output specifications. This framework preserves LLMs' broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities while ensuring the outputs conform to user demands. Specifically, DICE first constructs structured CoT adaptation datasets via a two-stage method and subsequently applies a dual-tuning strategy to fine-tune SLMs for generating structured outputs in an analyze-then-answer pattern. Experiments demonstrate that DICE improves the average format accuracy and content correctness of LLM outputs by 35.4\\% and 29.4\\%, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance over other competitive baselines.",

However, as LLMs themselves continue to advance in scale and capability, the relative advantages of traditional RAG frameworks have become less pronounced and necessary. Here, we present a comprehensive review of RAG, beginning with its overarching objectives and core components. We then analyze the key challenges within RAG, highlighting critical weakness that may limit its effectiveness.

We propose a new method for semantic frame induction based on CLMs. Specifically, we introduce FrameEOL, a prompt-based method for obtaining Frame Embeddings that outputs One frame-name as a Label representing the given situation. To obtain embeddings more suitable for frame induction, we leverage in-context learning (ICL) and deep metric learning (DML). Frame induction is then performed by clustering the resulting embeddings. Experimental results on the English and Japanese FrameNet datasets demonstrate that the proposed methods outperform existing frame induction methods. In particular, for Japanese, which lacks extensive frame resources, the CLM-based method using only 5 ICL examples achieved comparable performance to the MLM-based method fine-tuned with DML.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in long chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning have largely prioritized answer accuracy and token efficiency, while overlooking aspects critical to trustworthiness. We argue that usable reasoning systems must be trustworthy, characterized by three properties: interpretability, faithfulness, and reliability. To this end, we propose ReFIne, a new training framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning with GRPO to encourage models to: (i) improve interpretability by producing structured, tag-based traces with high-level planning that are easier for humans to follow; (ii) enhance faithfulness by explicitly disclosing the decisive information guiding each solution, with consistent cross-section references; and (iii) promote reliability by providing self-assessments of both the derivation's soundness and the confidence of the final answer. We apply ReFIne to the Qwen3 models at multiple scales (1.7B/4B/8B) and evaluate across mathematical benchmarks of varying difficulty. Our experimental results show that ReFIne models generate clearer and better-structured reasoning traces (interpretability +44.0%), more faithfully expose their underlying decision process (faithfulness +18.8%), and offer informative confidence estimates (reliability +42.4%). These findings highlight an overlooked but important direction: reasoning models should be optimized not only for accuracy, but also for broader dimensions of trustworthiness.

        "summary": "Recent work suggests that large language models (LLMs) encode factuality signals in their internal representations, such as hidden states, attention weights, or token probabilities, implying that LLMs may \"know what they don't know\". However, LLMs can also produce factual errors by relying on shortcuts or spurious associations. These error are driven by the same training objective that encourage correct predictions, raising the question of whether internal computations can reliably distinguish between factual and hallucinated outputs. In this work, we conduct a mechanistic analysis of how LLMs internally process factual queries by comparing two types of hallucinations based on their reliance on subject information. We find that when hallucinations are associated with subject knowledge, LLMs employ the same internal recall process as for correct responses, leading to overlapping and indistinguishable hidden-state geometries. In contrast, hallucinations detached from subject knowledge produce distinct, clustered representations that make them detectable. These findings reveal a fundamental limitation: LLMs do not encode truthfulness in their internal states but only patterns of knowledge recall, demonstrating that \"LLMs don't really know what they don't know\".",

We provide a unified view, demonstrating that their reliance on static or overly simplistic weighting schemes tied to sample difficulty prevents adaptation to a model's evolving capabilities. This creates a significant loss scale issue, where training disproportionately focuses on certain difficulty levels at the expense of others, hindering overall performance. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{Difficulty-Aware Reweighting Policy Optimization (DARO)}, a method that dynamically adjusts the loss contribution of each difficulty group based on the model's learning state.

To bridge this gap, we propose SOP-Maze, a benchmark constructed from real-world business data and adapted into a collection of 397 tasks from 23 complex SOP scenarios. We further categorize SOP tasks into two broad classes: Lateral Root System (LRS), representing wide-option tasks that demand precise selection; and Heart Root System (HRS), which emphasizes deep logical reasoning with complex branches. Extensive experiments reveal that nearly all state-of-the-art models struggle with SOP-Maze. We conduct a comprehensive analysis and identify three key error categories: (i) route blindness: difficulty following procedures; (ii) conversational fragility: inability to handle real dialogue nuances; and (iii) calculation errors: mistakes in time or arithmetic reasoning under complex contexts. The systematic study explores LLM performance across SOP tasks that challenge both breadth and depth, offering new insights for improving model capabilities.

Current context compression methods predominantly rely on autoencoding tasks to train context-agnostic compression tokens to compress contextual semantics. While autoencoding tasks enable compression tokens to acquire compression capabilities, compression via autoencoding tasks creates a fundamental mismatch: the models are optimized for reconstruction that diverge from actual downstream tasks, thereby weakening the features more beneficial for real-world usage. We propose Semantic-Anchor Compression (SAC), a novel method that shifts from autoencoding task based compression to an architecture that is equipped with this compression capability \\textit{a priori}. Instead of training models to compress contexts through autoencoding tasks, SAC directly selects so-called anchor tokens from the original context and aggregates contextual information into their key-value (KV) representations. By deriving representations directly from the contextual tokens, SAC eliminates the need for autoencoding training. To ensure compression performance while directly leveraging anchor tokens, SAC incorporates two key designs: (1) anchor embeddings that enable the compressor to identify critical tokens, and (2) bidirectional attention modification that allows anchor tokens to capture information from the entire context. Experimental results demonstrate that SAC consistently outperforms existing context compression methods across various compression ratios. On out-of-distribution evaluation using MRQA, SAC achieves 1 EM improvement at 5x compression over strong baselines, with increasing advantages at higher compression ratios.",

In this work, we introduce a complementary approach that explicitly promotes exploration during sampling by applying distinct temperature settings for different token types. Specifically, our method employs higher temperatures for reasoning tokens to actively encourage exploration, while retaining lower temperatures for knowledge tokens to maintain factual correctness. Furthermore, we systematically investigate various multi-temperature scheduling strategies and their impacts within reinforcement learning contexts.

To fill this gap, we introduce FinAuditing, the first taxonomy-aligned, structure-aware, multi-document benchmark for evaluating LLMs on financial auditing tasks. Built from real US-GAAP-compliant XBRL filings, FinAuditing defines three complementary subtasks, FinSM for semantic consistency, FinRE for relational consistency, and FinMR for numerical consistency, each targeting a distinct aspect of structured auditing reasoning. We further propose a unified evaluation framework integrating retrieval, classification, and reasoning metrics across these subtasks. Extensive zero-shot experiments on 13 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that current models perform inconsistently across semantic, relational, and mathematical dimensions, with accuracy drops of up to 60-90% when reasoning over hierarchical multi-document structures. Our findings expose the systematic limitations of modern LLMs in taxonomy-grounded financial reasoning and establish FinAuditing as a foundation for developing trustworthy, structure-aware, and regulation-aligned financial intelligence systems.

In this work, we evaluate QE reranking performance on document-level (rather than the typical sentence-level) translation, using various learned and large language model (LLM)-based QE metrics. We find that with our best learned metric, SLIDE, BLEURT-20 scores improve by +2.00 with only two candidates, and by +5.09 with 32, across both decoder-only LLM models and encoder-decoder neural machine translation (NMT) models. Using the best LLM-based metric, GEMBA-DA, gains of +1.63 and +4.30 are achieved under the same conditions. Although gains shrink with longer inputs, reranking with 32 candidates yields improvements of +2.34 (SLIDE) and +1.40 (GEMBA-DA) on our longest documents (512-1024 source tokens). These findings demonstrate the practical value of document-level QE, with minimal runtime overhead given suitable translation models and hardware.",

These attacks target different harm categories (like malware generation, harassment, or fraud) through distinct conversational approaches (educational discussions, personal experiences, hypothetical scenarios). Existing multi-turn jailbreaking methods often rely on heuristic or ad hoc exploration strategies, providing limited insight into underlying model weaknesses. The relationship between conversation patterns and model vulnerabilities across harm categories remains poorly understood. We propose Pattern Enhanced Chain of Attack (PE-CoA), a framework of five conversation patterns to construct effective multi-turn jailbreaks through natural dialogue. Evaluating PE-CoA on twelve LLMs spanning ten harm categories, we achieve state-of-the-art performance, uncovering pattern-specific vulnerabilities and LLM behavioral characteristics: models exhibit distinct weakness profiles where robustness to one conversational pattern does not generalize to others, and model families share similar failure modes. These findings highlight limitations of safety training and indicate the need for pattern-aware defenses. Code available on: https://github.com/Ragib-Amin-Nihal/PE-CoA",

Knowledge graphs (KGs) offer a structured source of relational evidence, but existing KGQA methods face fundamental trade-offs: compiling complete SPARQL queries without knowing available relations proves brittle, retrieving large subgraphs introduces noise, and complex agent frameworks with parallel exploration exponentially expand search spaces. To address these limitations, we propose Search-on-Graph (SoG), a simple yet effective framework that enables LLMs to perform iterative informed graph navigation using a single, carefully designed \\textsc{Search} function. Rather than pre-planning paths or retrieving large subgraphs, SoG follows an ``observe-then-navigate'' principle: at each step, the LLM examines actual available relations from the current entity before deciding on the next hop. This approach further adapts seamlessly to different KG schemas and handles high-degree nodes through adaptive filtering. Across six KGQA benchmarks spanning Freebase and Wikidata, SoG achieves state-of-the-art performance without fine-tuning. We demonstrate particularly strong gains on Wikidata benchmarks (+16\\% improvement over previous best methods) alongside consistent improvements on Freebase benchmarks.",

MOSAIC is designed as a training-free framework with specially designed agents to self-reflect, create the rationale, code, and debug within a student-teacher paradigm to address the challenges of scientific code generation. This design facilitates stepwise problem decomposition, targeted error correction, and, when combined with our Consolidated Context Window (CCW), mitigates LLM hallucinations when solving complex scientific tasks involving chained subproblems.

Existing benchmarks suffer from high computational costs, score inflation, and a bias towards trivial bugs over rare, critical faults. In this work, we ask two fundamental questions: (1) What is the minimal set of wrong codes sufficient to represent the entire error space? and (2) What is the minimal set of test cases needed to distinguish them? We introduce a framework that formalizes benchmark construction as finding an optimal diagnostic basis in a binary code-test matrix. The rank of this matrix specifies the minimal number of independent error patterns (wrong codes) and provides a tight upper bound on the number of test cases required for complete fault coverage. Our objective is to identify a basis of size equal to the matrix rank that maximizes internal diversity. To tackle this NP-hard problem, we propose WrongSelect, an efficient approximation algorithm to select maximally diverse wrong codes. Applying this framework to millions of competitive programming submissions, we construct TC-Bench, a compact, diverse, and inflation-resistant benchmark. Extensive experiments show that even the most advanced test case generation methods achieve only ~60% exclusion rates on TC-Bench, exposing a significant gap in their diagnostic power.

We propose a formal framework that decomposes the process of identifying significant distinctions between cases into three-stage reasoning tasks. Our framework models cases using factual predicates called factors, organizes them into a legal knowledge hierarchy, and defines verifiable rules for identifying distinctions, analyzing their argumentative support, and evaluating their significance. Through comprehensive evaluation of modern reasoning LLMs, we reveal a paradox: while models achieve high accuracy on surface-level reasoning (Task 1), performance degrades on hierarchical reasoning (Task 2: 64.82%-92.09%) and collapses on integrated analysis (Task 3: 11.46%-33.99%). Most strikingly, we find that models consistently expend more computational resources on incorrect responses than correct ones, suggesting that \"thinking longer\" does not always mean \"thinking smarter.\" Our work provides a methodology for fine-grained analysis of LLM reasoning capabilities in complex domains and reveals fundamental limitations that must be addressed for robust and trustworthy legal AI.",

Previous works trade reasoning efficiency by either laborious discrete prompt designing or the construction of external compressed CoT datasets that sacrifice key reasoning details. In this work, we propose Upfront CoT (UCoT): an efficient reasoning framework with upfront thought embedding to automate CoT compression. UCoT is a cooperative workflow involving a small model (compressor) and a large model (executor). The first stage of UCoT trains compressor to generate upfront thought embeddings rich in reasoning information for the executor, avoiding the drawbacks of manually designed prompts. The second stage optimizes executor to utilize upfront thought embeddings to derive the correct answer with short reasoning, using a reward mechanism. Extensive experiments show that UCoT maintains the powerful reasoning ability of executor while significantly reducing the length of CoT. It is worth mentioning that when applying UCoT to the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct model, the usage of tokens on GSM8K dataset is reduced by 50\\%, while the performance is 3.08\\% higher than that of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) method.

Our analysis identifies two key issues of such systems: important policy-relevant cues such as targets and attack types are not hypothesized by the model as a likely explanation; and the binary reward signal is insufficient to guide reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose ExPO-HM (Explain-then-Detect Policy Optimization for Hateful Memes), inspired by the training and evaluation process of human annotators. ExPO-HM combines SFT warmup, GRPO with curriculum learning, and Conditional Decision Entropy (CDE) as both metric and reward for reasoning quality. Across three hateful meme benchmarks, ExPO-HM achieves state-of-the-art performance on binary detection, fine-grained classification, and reasoning quality, with up to 15\\% and 17\\% F1 improvement over the GRPO and DPO baselines, respectively. By moving hateful meme detection from simple binary alarms to explanation-driven detection, ExPO-HM provides accurate, interpretable, and actionable moderation support.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced recommendation capabilities through enhanced reasoning, but pose significant challenges for real-world deployment due to high inference costs. Conversely, while Small Language Models (SLMs) offer an efficient alternative, their reasoning capabilities for recommendation remain underexplored. Existing systems often use natural language rationales merely as unsupervised descriptive text, failing to harness their full potential as learning signals. In this work our main idea is to create a common understanding of user and items across multiple domains called Thought Space with SLMs instead of using LLMs' distilled knowledge. To that end we propose PULSE (Preference Understanding by Latent Semantic Embeddings), a framework that treats SLM-generated rationales as director learning signals, supervising them with interaction histories to jointly model user actions (what) and their semantic drivers (why). Existing methods consider only interactions such as sequences and embeddings, whereas PULSE treats rationales as first-class signals, this novel design yields embeddings that are more robust and generalizable. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PULSE outperforms leading ID, Collaborative Filtering (CF), and LLM-based sequential recommendation models across multiple benchmark datasets. Furthermore, PULSE exhibits superior transferability in cross-domain recommendation and demonstrates strong performance on downstream tasks such as reasoning-oriented question answering.

We investigate whether such \"evaluation scent\" inflates measured performance without commensurate capability gains. Using a single open-weights model (GPT-OSS-20B), we run six paired A/B scenarios that hold task content and decoding fixed while varying framing (evaluation-oriented vs. real-world) and reasoning depth (Medium/High): deterministic math, strict code-fix, citation generation, incentive flips (caution vs. competence), CoT visibility, and multilingual (Urdu) headers. Deterministic validators compute accuracy, answer-only compliance, hedging/refusals, chain-of-thought (CoT) length, and schema compliance, with pre-registered deltas and composite indices. Across scenarios, evaluation framing reliably inflates CoT (hundreds to >1000 characters) and reduces answer-only compliance, with limited or inconsistent accuracy gains. In structured outputs, it improves wrappers (e.g., fenced blocks, enumerated lists) but not regex-validated substance. Incentive wording reweights error composition: praising caution modestly improves accuracy at high reasoning and reduces wrong-but-confident errors, whereas praising competence yields terser but riskier outputs. Urdu rubric headers reproduce these signatures and can decrease accuracy at higher reasoning depth, indicating multilingual parity risks. We provide a reproducible A/B framework (prompt banks, validators, per-run scores, scripts; versioned DOI) and practical guidance: neutral phrasing or dual-framing checks, contract-aware grading, style-delta reporting, confidence governance, and multilingual dashboards to ensure that benchmark gains reflect deployable capability.",

Given an interview transcript and a set of user stories, our metric quantifies (i) correctness: the proportion of stories supported by the transcript, and (ii) completeness: the proportion of transcript supported by at least one story. We segment the transcript into text chunks and instantiate the alignment as a matching problem between chunks and stories. Experiments over four datasets show that an LLM-based matcher achieves 0.86 macro-F1 on held-out annotations, while embedding models alone remain behind but enable effective blocking.

Recent Thai models have primarily relied on existing open-source models, applying additional training without structural modifications to specialize in Thai. However, this approach risks eroding pre-existing knowledge in the model's parameter space during the injection of Thai-specific information, as optimized parameters for general tasks may conflict with new linguistic requirements. In contrast, JAI-1 adopts an upscaling strategy: starting from a smaller, high-performing English open-source LLM, we expanded its parameter space and utilized the newly allocated capacity to systematically integrate Thai-language knowledge. This methodology not only preserves the original model's general intelligence but also establishes a unique architecture distinct from other open-source models, enabling scalable future enhancements. During pre-training, JAI-1 was exposed to 1.5T tokens, including over 300B Thai language tokens. This was followed by post-training stages -- supervised fine-tuning and alignment tuning -- using more than 600K instruction-based examples. The final model demonstrated superior performance compared to Typhoon2-70B on Thai-centric benchmarks (IFEval-TH, MT-Bench-TH, and JAI-Hall-Bench), validating the efficacy of its upscaling and knowledge-integration framework.",

        "summary": "Mathematical reasoning serves as a crucial testbed for evaluating the intelligence of large language models (LLMs), and math word problems (MWPs) represent one of the most widely used formats. Most existing MWP datasets contain only the necessary information, while problems with distracting or excessive conditions are often overlooked. Prior studies have shown that popular LLMs experience a dramatic performance drop when such distracting conditions are introduced. However, available datasets of MWPs with distracting conditions remain limited, and most exhibit low difficulty and out-of-context expressions. These shortcomings make the distracting conditions easy to detect and disregard, thereby reducing the credibility of benchmarking on these datasets. Moreover, when distracting conditions are added, the reasoning process and answers may change, requiring intensive manual effort to check and rewrite solutions. To address these issues, we design an iterative framework that leverages LLMs to generate distracting conditions automatically. We develop a set of prompts to revise MWPs from multiple perspectives and cognitive levels, encouraging the creation of meaningful distracting conditions as well as suggestions for further refinement. A key advantage of our framework is the preservation of shared solutions between the original and revised problems: the LLMs are explicitly guided to generate distractions that do not alter the original solution, thus eliminating the need to produce new answers. This framework is efficient and easy to deploy, substantially reducing the effort required to generate MWPs with distracting conditions while maintaining high data quality.",

Gender has long influenced physician behaviors and patient outcomes, raising concerns that LLMs assuming human-like roles, such as clinicians or medical educators, may replicate or amplify gender-related biases. Using case studies from the New England Journal of Medicine Challenge (NEJM), we assigned genders (female, male, or unspecified) to multiple open-source and proprietary LLMs. We evaluated their response consistency across LLM-gender assignments regarding both LLM-based diagnosis and models' judgments on the clinical relevance or necessity of patient gender. In our findings, diagnoses were relatively consistent across LLM genders for most models. However, for patient gender's relevance and necessity in LLM-based diagnosis, all models demonstrated substantial inconsistency across LLM genders, particularly for relevance judgements. Some models even displayed a systematic female-male disparity in their interpretation of patient gender. These findings present an underexplored bias that could undermine the reliability of LLMs in clinical practice, underscoring the need for routine checks of identity-assignment consistency when interacting with LLMs to ensure reliable and equitable AI-supported clinical care.",

This graph-based perspective enables us to employ graph algorithms such as PageRank to characterize the properties of LLMs, revealing both shared and model-specific reasoning behaviors across diverse datasets. We further identify the activated neurons within GraphGhost and evaluate them through structural interventions, showing that edits to key neuron nodes can trigger reasoning collapse, altering both logical flow and semantic understanding.

However, it remains limited by the difficulty of extracting meaningful features and capturing sparse, heterogeneous depressive cues over time. Pretrained self-supervised learning (SSL) models such as WavLM provide rich, multi-layer speech representations, yet most existing SDD methods rely only on the final layer or search for a single best-performing one. These approaches often overfit to specific datasets and fail to leverage the full hierarchical structure needed to detect subtle and persistent depression signals. To address this challenge, we propose HAREN-CTC, a novel architecture that integrates multi-layer SSL features using cross-attention within a multitask learning framework, combined with Connectionist Temporal Classification loss to handle sparse temporal supervision. HAREN-CTC comprises two key modules: a Hierarchical Adaptive Clustering module that reorganizes SSL features into complementary embeddings, and a Cross-Modal Fusion module that models inter-layer dependencies through cross-attention. The CTC objective enables alignment-aware training, allowing the model to track irregular temporal patterns of depressive speech cues. We evaluate HAREN-CTC under both an upper-bound setting with standard data splits and a generalization setting using five-fold cross-validation.

        "summary": "Biomedical Named Entity Recognition (BioNER), task6 in BioASQ (A challenge in large-scale biomedical semantic indexing and question answering), is crucial for extracting information from scientific literature but faces hurdles such as distinguishing between similar entity types like genes and chemicals. This study evaluates the GLiNER-BioMed model on a BioASQ dataset and introduces a targeted dictionary-based post-processing strategy to address common misclassifications. While this post-processing approach demonstrated notable improvement on our development set, increasing the micro F1-score from a baseline of 0.79 to 0.83, this enhancement did not generalize to the blind test set, where the post-processed model achieved a micro F1-score of 0.77 compared to the baselines 0.79. We also discuss insights gained from exploring alternative methodologies, including Conditional Random Fields. This work highlights the potential of dictionary-based refinement for pre-trained BioNER models but underscores the critical challenge of overfitting to development data and the necessity of ensuring robust generalization for real-world applicability.",

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks, a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning (SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks, which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense, per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning, improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by +5.96.

This study addresses the significant challenge of speaker anonymization within multi-speaker conversational audio, specifically when only a single target speaker needs to be anonymized. This scenario is highly relevant in contexts like call centers, where customer privacy necessitates anonymizing only the customer's voice in interactions with operators. Conventional anonymization methods are often not suitable for this task. Moreover, current evaluation methodology does not allow us to accurately assess privacy protection and utility in this complex multi-speaker scenario. This work aims to bridge these gaps by exploring effective strategies for targeted speaker anonymization in conversational audio, highlighting potential problems in their development and proposing corresponding improved evaluation methodologies.",

        "summary": "Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3 and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to 73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance, enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric reasoning in MLLMs.",

In an idealised setting with gold word boundaries, we ask whether performance is limited by the representation of word segments, or by the clustering methods that group them into word-like types. We combine a range of self-supervised speech features (continuous/discrete, frame/word-level) with different clustering methods (K-means, hierarchical, graph-based) on English and Mandarin data. The best system uses graph clustering with dynamic time warping on continuous features. Faster alternatives use graph clustering with cosine distance on averaged continuous features or edit distance on discrete unit sequences. Through controlled experiments that isolate either the representations or the clustering method, we demonstrate that representation variability across segments of the same word type -- rather than clustering -- is the primary factor limiting performance.",

As LLMs increasingly interact with external data sources, indirect prompt injection emerges as a critical and evolving attack vector, enabling adversaries to exploit models through manipulated inputs. Through a systematic evaluation of indirect prompt injection attacks across diverse models, we analyze how susceptible current LLMs are to such attacks, which parameters, including model size and manufacturer, specific implementations, shape their vulnerability, and which attack methods remain most effective. Our results reveal that even well-known attack patterns continue to succeed, exposing persistent weaknesses in model defenses. To address these vulnerabilities, we emphasize the need for strengthened training procedures to enhance inherent resilience, a centralized database of known attack vectors to enable proactive defense, and a unified testing framework to ensure continuous security validation. These steps are essential to push developers toward integrating security into the core design of LLMs, as our findings show that current models still fail to mitigate long-standing threats.",

However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other prior arts.",

The prevailing paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn, adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors, enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks. Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%, and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.",

Our approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a skeleton-completeness scoring mechanism that enhances preference alignment between generated queries and optimal SQL structures; (2) a query-latency-aware reward system that incentivizes the generation of computationally efficient SQL queries; (3) a self-distillation process for thinking-mode completion that prevents degradation of the model's reasoning capabilities. This framework enables hybrid thinking models to switch between reasoning and non-reasoning modes while improving SQL query accuracy and execution efficiency. Experimental evaluation, conducted on MySQL 8.0 and SQLite 3.42 under controlled single-user conditions, demonstrates that HES-SQL achieves competitive performance with execution accuracies of 79.14\\% and 54.9\\% on the BIRD and KaggleDBQA benchmarks, respectively. Query latency is measured as the end-to-end execution time of generated queries on the DBMS, averaged over multiple runs to mitigate variance. Efficiency gains range from 11\\% to 20\\% relative to supervised baselines. Our results establish a new paradigm for Text-to-SQL systems that effectively balances semantic accuracy with computational efficiency through execution-informed reinforcement learning (RL).

Finally, at the inference stage, we propose progressively guided generation, which sequentially emphasizes more fine-grained information, aligning inherently with the coarse-to-fine sampling nature of DiT.

We conducted controlled experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556) and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a 14$\\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point (pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3 percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect (P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures (+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically devalue creative content when labeled as \"AI-generated\" regardless of which AI created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not only replicate but amplify this human tendency.",

        "summary": "Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.",

Although vehicle routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning, their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models (LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans. As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like India.",

Can Whisper be made lighter and faster for edge devices in data-scarce settings? Focusing on Bambara with only 32h of speech-to-text data, we propose a new pruning recipe. Instead of vocabulary pruning, which is unsuitable due to frequent code-switching by Bambara speakers, we compress the embeddings with low-rank decomposition and feature distillation. Rather than removing layers, we merge them to limit performance loss. The final model preserves 90% of the original performance while being 48% smaller and 2.15x faster on a MacBook Air M1.",

In this work, we revisit articulatory information in the era of deep learning and propose a framework that leverages articulatory representations both as an auxiliary task and as a pseudo-input to the recognition model. Specifically, we employ speech inversion as an auxiliary prediction task, and the predicted articulatory features are injected into the model as a query stream in a cross-attention module with acoustic embeddings as keys and values. Experiments on LibriSpeech demonstrate that our approach yields consistent improvements over strong transformer-based baselines, particularly under low-resource conditions. These findings suggest that articulatory features, once sidelined in ASR research, can provide meaningful benefits when reintroduced with modern architectures.",

This development signifies a paradigm shift from conventional, GUI-driven user interfaces toward intuitive, language-first interaction paradigms. Rather than manually navigating applications, users can articulate their objectives in natural language, enabling LLMs to orchestrate actions across multiple applications in a dynamic and contextual manner. However, extant implementations frequently rely on cloud-based proprietary models, which introduce limitations in terms of privacy, autonomy, and scalability. For language-first interaction to become a truly robust and trusted interface paradigm, local deployment is not merely a convenience; it is an imperative. This limitation underscores the importance of evaluating the feasibility of locally deployable, open-source, and open-access LLMs as foundational components for future intent-based operating systems. In this study, we examine the capabilities of several open-source and open-access models in facilitating user intention resolution through machine assistance. A comparative analysis is conducted against OpenAI's proprietary GPT-4-based systems to assess performance in generating workflows for various user intentions. The present study offers empirical insights into the practical viability, performance trade-offs, and potential of open LLMs as autonomous, locally operable components in next-generation operating systems. The results of this study inform the broader discussion on the decentralization and democratization of AI infrastructure and point toward a future where user-device interaction becomes more seamless, adaptive, and privacy-conscious through locally embedded intelligence.",

Our analysis includes explicit bounds on distances and separation criteria for token vectors under softmax scaling. Through experiments with pre-trained GPT-2 model, we empirically validate our theoretical results and analyze key behaviors of the attention mechanism. Notably, we demonstrate that as the number of selected tokens increases, the model's ability to distinguish informative tokens declines, often converging toward a uniform selection pattern. We also show that gradient sensitivity under softmax normalization presents challenges during training, especially at low temperature settings. These findings advance current understanding of softmax-based attention mechanism and motivate the need for more robust normalization and selection strategies in future attention architectures.",

        "summary": "Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI) applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to baselines. Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual (with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g., Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.",

        "summary": "Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information, follow instructions, and perform forms of \"reasoning\" and planning across a wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources. Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT integration.",

We provide an exploratory analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust patient support.

        "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses. In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios requiring persuasive communication.",

        "summary": "Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand, existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.",

We present a training-free, inference-time control mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation. Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints, approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically, across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.",

This suggests that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final predictions. Our code and data is available at https://github.com/suhanmen/MECO.",

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated significant advancements across various domains including translation and summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore, proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.",

        "summary": "Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however, are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR), designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern, creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches. Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the state-of-the-art.

However, research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking. To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them. Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.",

However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty, DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by 7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.",

Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons. Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon, SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen TartanDrive dataset.

Guidewires with robotic tips can enhance maneuverability, but they present challenges in modeling and control. Automation of soft robotic guidewire navigation has the potential to overcome these challenges, increasing the precision and safety of endovascular navigation. In other surgical domains, end-to-end imitation learning has shown promising results. Thus, we develop a transformer-based imitation learning framework with goal conditioning, relative action outputs, and automatic contrast dye injections to enable generalizable soft robotic guidewire navigation in an aneurysm targeting task. We train the model on 36 different modular bifurcated geometries, generating 647 total demonstrations under simulated fluoroscopy, and evaluate it on three previously unseen vascular geometries. The model can autonomously drive the tip of the robot to the aneurysm location with a success rate of 83% on the unseen geometries, outperforming several baselines.

        "summary": "Robust precoding is efficiently feasible in frequency division duplex (FDD) systems by incorporating the learnt statistics of the propagation environment through a generative model. We build on previous work that successfully designed site-specific precoders based on a combination of Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) and graph neural networks (GNNs). In this paper, by utilizing a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE), we circumvent one of the key drawbacks of GMMs, i.e., the number of GMM components scales exponentially to the feedback bits. In addition, the deep learning architecture of the VQ-VAE allows us to jointly train the GNN together with VQ-VAE along with pilot optimization forming an end-to-end (E2E) model, resulting in considerable performance gains in sum rate for multi-user wireless systems. Simulations demonstrate the superiority of the proposed frameworks over the conventional methods involving the sub-discrete Fourier transform (DFT) pilot matrix and iterative precoder algorithms enabling the deployment of systems characterized by fewer pilots or feedback bits.",

We conduct extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale e-commerce platform.ChoirRec improves GAUC by 1.16\\% in offline evaluations, while online A/B testing reveals a 7.24\\% increase in order volume, highlighting its substantial practical value in real-world applications.",

In response, we develop deep-REMAP, a novel deep learning framework that utilizes a regularized, multi-task approach to predict stellar atmospheric parameters from observed spectra. We train a deep convolutional neural network on the PHOENIX synthetic spectral library and use transfer learning to fine-tune the model on a small subset of observed FGK dwarf spectra from the MARVELS survey. We then apply the model to 732 uncharacterized FGK giant candidates from the same survey. When validated on 30 MARVELS calibration stars, deep-REMAP accurately recovers the effective temperature ($T_{\\rm{eff}}$), surface gravity ($\\log \\rm{g}$), and metallicity ([Fe/H]), achieving a precision of, for instance, approximately 75 K in $T_{\\rm{eff}}$. By combining an asymmetric loss function with an embedding loss, our regression-as-classification framework is interpretable, robust to parameter imbalances, and capable of capturing non-Gaussian uncertainties. While developed for MARVELS, the deep-REMAP framework is extensible to other surveys and synthetic libraries, demonstrating a powerful and automated pathway for stellar characterization.",

This dataset is used to train a neural network that takes as inputs the task parameters describing the obstacle dimensions and location, derived automatically from a point cloud, and outputs the DMP parameters that generate the trajectory. The approach is validated in simulation and real-robot experiments, outperforming a RRT-Connect baseline in terms of computation and execution time, as well as trajectory length, while supporting multi-modal trajectory generation for different obstacle geometries and end-effector dimensions.

We categorize existing approaches into traditional prior-based methods and modern data-driven models, including CNNs, transformers, diffusion models, and emerging vision-language models (VLMs).

        "summary": "Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety, i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement and causal correlation among multiple explanations.

In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover, our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias. Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.",

While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly, synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention, enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples, exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets, directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models.

While prior work shows that human reactions can indicate robot failures, few studies examine how these evolving responses reveal successive failures. This research uses machine learning to recognize stages of robot failure from human reactions. In a study with 26 participants interacting with a robot that made repeated conversational errors, behavioral features were extracted from video data to train models for individual users.

        "summary": "Current benchmarks for evaluating software engineering agents, such as SWE-Bench Verified, are predominantly derived from GitHub issues and fail to accurately reflect how developers interact with chat-based coding assistants in integrated development environments (IDEs). We posit that this mismatch leads to a systematic overestimation of agent's capabilities in real-world scenarios, especially bug fixing. We introduce a novel benchmarking framework that transforms existing formal benchmarks into realistic user queries through systematic analysis of developer interaction patterns with chat-based agents. Our methodology is flexible and can be easily extended to existing benchmarks. In this paper, we apply our testing framework to SWE-Bench Verified, the TypeScript subset of Multi-SWE-Bench and a private benchmark, SWE-Bench C# and transform formal GitHub issue descriptions into realistic user-style queries based on telemetry analysis of a popular chat-based agent interactions. Our findings reveal that existing benchmarks significantly overestimate agent capabilities for some models by >50% over baseline performance for public benchmarks and ~10-16% for our internal benchmark. This work establishes a new paradigm for evaluating interactive chat-based software engineering agents through benchmark mutation techniques.",

        "summary": "The rapid expansion of software development has significant environmental, technical, social, and economic impacts. Achieving the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals by 2030 compels developers to adopt sustainable practices. Existing methods mostly offer high-level guidelines, which are time-consuming to implement and rely on team adaptability. Moreover, they focus on design or implementation, while sustainability assessment should start at the requirements engineering phase. In this paper, we introduce SEER, a framework which addresses sustainability concerns in the early software development phase. The framework operates in three stages: (i) it identifies sustainability requirements (SRs) relevant to a specific software product from a general taxonomy; (ii) it evaluates how sustainable system requirements are based on the identified SRs; and (iii) it optimizes system requirements that fail to satisfy any SR. The framework is implemented using the reasoning capabilities of large language models and the agentic RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach. SEER has been experimented on four software projects from different domains. Results generated using Gemini 2.5 reasoning model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in accurately identifying a broad range of sustainability concerns across diverse domains.",

        "summary": "The growth of the e-commerce industry has intensified the adversarial dynamics between shadow economy actors and risk management teams. Companies often conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging fraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc governance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial workload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of long-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk dimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the establishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these challenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk investigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1) extracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a domain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the data flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations, and model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment, and (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&R) module that collaborates with the domain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns. Experiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com demonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both factual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results. Deployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially enhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers.",

We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73% performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in the MVBench dataset.

AIMS was designed to enhance collaborative clinical reasoning and health promotion competencies among students from pharmacy, medicine, nursing, and social work. A formal usability testing session was conducted which participants assumed professional roles on a healthcare team and engaged in a mix of scripted and unscripted conversations.

        "summary": "Many important applications across science, data analytics, and AI workloads depend on distributed matrix multiplication. Prior work has developed a large array of algorithms suitable for different problem sizes and partitionings including 1D, 2D, 1.5D, and 2.5D algorithms. A limitation of current work is that existing algorithms are limited to a subset of partitionings. Multiple algorithm implementations are required to support the full space of possible partitionings. If no algorithm implementation is available for a particular set of partitionings, one or more operands must be redistributed, increasing communication costs. This paper presents a universal one-sided algorithm for distributed matrix multiplication that supports all combinations of partitionings and replication factors. Our algorithm uses slicing (index arithmetic) to compute the sets of overlapping tiles that must be multiplied together. This list of local matrix multiplies can then either be executed directly, or reordered and lowered to an optimized IR to maximize overlap. We implement our algorithm using a high-level C++-based PGAS programming framework that performs direct GPU-to-GPU communication using intra-node interconnects. We evaluate performance for a wide variety of partitionings and replication factors, finding that our work is competitive with PyTorch DTensor, a highly optimized distributed tensor library targeting AI models.",

We present a method for file path retrieval that fine tunes a strong LLM (Qwen3-8B) with QLoRA and Unsloth optimizations to predict relevant file paths directly from a natural language query. To build training data, we introduce six code aware strategies that use abstract syntax tree (AST) structure and repository content to generate realistic question-answer pairs, where answers are sets of file paths. The strategies range from single file prompts to hierarchical repository summaries, providing broad coverage. We fine tune on Python projects including Flask, Click, Jinja, FastAPI, and PyTorch, and obtain high retrieval accuracy: up to 91\\% exact match and 93\\% recall on held out queries, clearly beating single strategy training. On a large codebase like PyTorch (about 4,000 Python files), the model reaches 59\\% recall, showing scalability. We analyze how multi level code signals help the LLM reason over cross file context and discuss dataset design, limits (for example, context length in very large repos), and future integration of retrieval with LLM based code intelligence.",

However, this adaptation remains challenging, as it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks.

For an efficiently samplable ensemble $D_m$ made by masking random $3$-CNFs with fresh $S_m\\ltimes(\\mathbb{Z}_2)^m$ symmetries and a small-seed Valiant--Vazirani isolation layer, we prove a Switching-by-Weakness normal form: for any polytime decoder $P$ of description length $\\le \\delta t$ (with $t=\\Theta(m)$ blocks), a short wrapper $W$ makes $(P\\circ W)$ per-bit local on a $\\gamma$-fraction of blocks.

Traditional methods, such as leg banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of kākā (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification, however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in kākā re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging methods for recognising kākā individuals and therefore improving the monitoring of populations.

Traditional defenses often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing, saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.",

        "summary": "Object transportation in cluttered environments is a fundamental task in various domains, including domestic service and warehouse logistics. In cooperative object transport, multiple robots must coordinate to move objects that are too large for a single robot. One transport strategy is pushing, which only requires simple robots. However, careful selection of robot-object contact points is necessary to push the object along a preplanned path. Although this selection can be solved analytically, the solution space grows combinatorially with the number of robots and object size, limiting scalability. Inspired by how humans rely on common-sense reasoning for cooperative transport, we propose combining the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models with local search to select suitable contact points. Our LLM-guided local search method for contact point selection, ConPoSe, successfully selects contact points for a variety of shapes, including cuboids, cylinders, and T-shapes. We demonstrate that ConPoSe scales better with the number of robots and object size than the analytical approach, and also outperforms pure LLM-based selection.",

        "summary": "Modern software teams frequently encounter delays in resolving recurring or related issues due to fragmented knowledge scattered across JIRA tickets, developer discussions, and GitHub pull requests (PRs). To address this challenge, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework that integrates Sentence-Transformers for semantic embeddings with FAISS-based vector search to deliver context-aware ticket resolution recommendations. The approach embeds historical JIRA tickets, user comments, and linked PR metadata to retrieve semantically similar past cases, which are then synthesized by a Large Language Model (LLM) into grounded and explainable resolution suggestions. The framework contributes a unified pipeline linking JIRA and GitHub data, an embedding and FAISS indexing strategy for heterogeneous software artifacts, and a resolution generation module guided by retrieved evidence. Experimental evaluation using precision, recall, resolution time reduction, and developer acceptance metrics shows that the proposed system significantly improves resolution accuracy, fix quality, and knowledge reuse in modern DevOps environments.",

Existing methods often lack dynamic integration of external tools, transparent reasoning, and user control over safety. To address these issues, we propose a controllable code generation framework utilizing the ReAct paradigm for multi-agent task execution. This framework is a multi-agent system designed to enable efficient, precise, and interpretable code generation through dynamic interactions between LLMs and external resources. The framework adopts a collaborative architecture comprising four specialized agents: a Planner for task decomposition, a Searcher that leverages the ReAct framework for reasoning and tool integration, a CodeGen agent for accurate code generation, and an Extractor for structured data retrieval. The ReAct-based Searcher alternates between generating reasoning traces and executing actions, facilitating seamless integration of internal knowledge with external tools (such as search engines) to enhance accuracy and user control. Experimental results show the framework's effectiveness across multiple languages, achieving a 94.8% security rate on the SVEN dataset with CodeQL, outperforming existing approaches. Its transparent reasoning process fosters user trust and improves controllability.",

        "summary": "LLM-based RTL generation is an interesting research direction, as it holds the potential to liberate the least automated stage in the current chip design. However, due to the substantial semantic gap between high-level specifications and RTL, coupled with limited training data, existing models struggle with generation accuracy. Drawing on human experience, design with verification helps improving accuracy. However, as the RTL testbench data are even more scarce, it is not friendly for LLMs. Although LLMs excel at higher-level languages like Python/C, they have a huge semantic gap from RTL. When implementing the same functionality, Python/C code and hardware code differ significantly in the spatiotemporal granularity, requiring the LLM not only to consider high-level functional semantics but also to ensure the low-level details align with the circuit code. It is not an easy task. In this paper, we propose a function abstracted verifiable middleware (Faver) that streamlines RTL verification in LLM-based workflows. By mixing LLM-friendly code structures with a rule-based template, Faver decouples the details of circuit verification, allowing the LLM to focus on the functionality itself. In our experiments on the SFT model and open-source models, Faver improved the model's generation accuracy by up to 14%.",

        "summary": "Android is the largest mobile platform, yet automatically building applications remains a practical challenge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for code repair, their use for fixing Android build errors remains underexplored. To address this gap, we first introduce AndroidBuildBench, a benchmark of 1,019 build failures curated from the commit histories of 43 open-source Android projects. Each problem is paired with a verified solution from a subsequent commit, ensuring that fixes are feasible. Second, we propose GradleFixer, an LLM agent with domain-specific tools for inspecting and manipulating the Gradle build environment. GradleFixer achieves a resolve rate of 81.4% (pass@1), significantly outperforming a state-of-the-art coding agent that relies on a general-purpose shell. GradleFixer's success suggests that while LLMs possess the high-level knowledge to solve these failures, they struggle to translate this knowledge into effective low-level actions using a general-purpose shell. We demonstrate the effectiveness of a strategy we term Tool Bridging, which replaces general-purpose shell commands with domain-aware abstractions. We hypothesize this approach works through two mechanisms: 1) it provides tools in an API-like format that LLMs use more reliably, and 2) it constrains the action space to relevant operations. This approach bridges the gap between the model's high-level reasoning and effective low-level execution.",

        "summary": "DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts. In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization: classification exploits \"Elsewhere\" concepts that fire everywhere except on target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles. Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond linear sparsity alone. Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors' conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer representations.",

Based on these observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary \"known/unknown\" classification.

        "summary": "The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in low-resource visual environments.

We present RePOPE-Spk, an audio-augmented extension of the RePOPE benchmark, where queries are provided as speech under diverse acoustic conditions. Using RePOPE-Spk, we systematically evaluate both proprietary and open-source models. Experimental results show that hallucinations escalate when queries are spoken rather than written: error rates increase by 3% under clean speech and by up to 20% with environmental noise.

Existing approaches typically compare audio recordings to music scores using heuristics or learnable models. This paper introduces \\textit{LadderSym}, a novel Transformer-based method for music error detection. \\textit{LadderSym} is guided by two key observations about the state-of-the-art approaches: (1) late fusion limits inter-stream alignment and cross-modality comparison capability; and (2) reliance on score audio introduces ambiguity in the frequency spectrum, degrading performance in music with concurrent notes. To address these limitations, \\textit{LadderSym} introduces (1) a two-stream encoder with inter-stream alignment modules to improve audio comparison capabilities and error detection F1 scores, and (2) a multimodal strategy that leverages both audio and symbolic scores by incorporating symbolic representations as decoder prompts, reducing ambiguity and improving F1 scores. We evaluate our method on the \\textit{MAESTRO-E} and \\textit{CocoChorales-E} datasets by measuring the F1 score for each note category.
