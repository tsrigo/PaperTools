        "summary": "Accurate time-series forecasting for complex physical systems is the backbone of modern industrial monitoring and control. While deep learning models excel at capturing complex dynamics, currently, their deployment is limited due to physical inconsistency and robustness, hence constraining their reliability in regulated environments. We introduce process-informed forecasting (PIF) models for temperature in pharmaceutical lyophilization. We investigate a wide range of models, from classical ones such as Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average Model (ARIMA) and Exponential Smoothing Model (ETS), to modern deep learning architectures, including Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs). We compare three different loss function formulations that integrate a process-informed trajectory prior: a fixed-weight loss, a dynamic uncertainty-based loss, and a Residual-Based Attention (RBA) mechanism. We evaluate all models not only for accuracy and physical consistency but also for robustness to sensor noise. Furthermore, we test the practical generalizability of the best model in a transfer learning scenario on a new process. Our results show that PIF models outperform their data-driven counterparts in terms of accuracy, physical plausibility and noise resilience. This work provides a roadmap for developing reliable and generalizable forecasting solutions for critical applications in the pharmaceutical manufacturing landscape.",

Production systems typically rely on tabular gradient-boosted decision trees (e.g., XGBoost) that score sessions independently, overlooking the relational and temporal structure of online activity that characterizes coordinated attacks and \"fraud rings.\" We introduce ATLAS (Account Takeover Learning Across Spatio-Temporal Directed Graph), a framework that reformulates ATO detection as spatio-temporal node classification on a time-respecting directed session graph. ATLAS links entities via shared identifiers (account, device, IP) and regulates connectivity with time-window and recency constraints, enabling causal, time-respecting message passing and latency-aware label propagation that uses only labels available at scoring time, non-anticipative and leakage-free. We operationalize ATLAS with inductive GraphSAGE variants trained via neighbor sampling, at scale on a sessions graph with more than 100M nodes and around 1B edges. On a high-risk digital product at Capital One, ATLAS delivers 6.38 percent AUC improvement and more than 50 percent reduction in customer friction, improving fraud capture while reducing user friction.",

In contrast to classical generalization theory, we approach this fundamental question by examining not only inputs and outputs, but the evolution of internal features. Our study suggests a phenomenon of temporal consistency that predictions remain stable when shallow features from earlier checkpoints combine with deeper features from later ones. This stability is not a trivial convergence artifact. It acts as a form of implicit, structured augmentation that supports generalization. We show that temporal consistency extends to unseen and corrupted data, but collapses when semantic structure is destroyed (e.g., random labels). Statistical tests further reveal that SGD injects anisotropic noise aligned with a few principal directions, reinforcing its role as a source of structured variability. Together, these findings suggest a conceptual perspective that links feature dynamics to generalization, pointing toward future work on practical surrogates for measuring temporal feature evolution.",

Could video models be on a trajectory towards general-purpose vision understanding, much like LLMs developed general-purpose language understanding? We demonstrate that Veo 3 can solve a broad variety of tasks it wasn't explicitly trained for: segmenting objects, detecting edges, editing images, understanding physical properties, recognizing object affordances, simulating tool use, and more. These abilities to perceive, model, and manipulate the visual world enable early forms of visual reasoning like maze and symmetry solving.

Notably, GNNs assume an existing underlying graph structure. While this underlying structure may not always exist or is derived independently from the signal, a temporally evolving functional network can always be constructed from multi-channel data. Graph Variate Signal Analysis (GVSA) defines a unified framework consisting of a network tensor of instantaneous connectivity profiles against a stable support usually constructed from the signal itself. Building on GVSA and tools from graph signal processing, we introduce Graph-Variate Neural Networks (GVNNs): layers that convolve spatio-temporal signals with a signal-dependent connectivity tensor combining a stable long-term support with instantaneous, data-driven interactions. This design captures dynamic statistical interdependencies at each time step without ad hoc sliding windows and admits an efficient implementation with linear complexity in sequence length. Across forecasting benchmarks, GVNNs consistently outperform strong graph-based baselines and are competitive with widely used sequence models such as LSTMs and Transformers. On EEG motor-imagery classification, GVNNs achieve strong accuracy highlighting their potential for brain-computer interface applications.",

We prove that for sequence models whose ESD is at most $K$, the minimax excess risk scales as $\\sigma^2 K$. Furthermore, we analyze over-parameterized gradient flow and prove that it can reduce the ESD. This finding establishes a connection between adaptive feature learning and provable improvements in generalization of spectral algorithms. We demonstrate the generality of the ESD framework by extending it to linear models and RKHS regression, and we support the theory with numerical experiments.

We argue that without tight objectives and verifiable constructions, benchmark rankings can produce high-confidence rankings that are in fact largely noise. We introduce two mechanisms to diagnose these issues. Schematic adherence quantifies how much of a judge's overall verdict is explained by the explicit evaluation schema, revealing unexplained variance when judges deviate from their own rubric. Psychometric validity aggregates internal consistency and discriminant validity signals to quantify irreducible uncertainty in any benchmarking run. Applying these tools to Arena-Hard Auto, we find severe schema incoherence and factor collapse across popular judges: for example, unexplained variance exceeding 90 percent for DeepSeek-R1-32B and factor correlations above 0.93 for most criteria. We also show that the ELO-style aggregation used by Arena-Hard Auto collapses and masks genuine ranking uncertainty. Our results highlight design failures that undermine validity and offer actionable principles for building better-scoped, reliability-aware LLM-judged benchmarks.

Oligopeptides have emerged as promising candidates in antimicrobial research due to their structural simplicity, high bioavailability, and low susceptibility to resistance. Despite their potential, computational models specifically designed to predict associations between oligopeptides and infectious diseases remain scarce. This study introduces a prompt-guided graph-based contrastive learning framework (PGCLODA) to uncover potential associations. A tripartite graph is constructed with oligopeptides, microbes, and diseases as nodes, incorporating both structural and semantic information. To preserve critical regions during contrastive learning, a prompt-guided graph augmentation strategy is employed to generate meaningful paired views. A dual encoder architecture, integrating Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and Transformer, is used to jointly capture local and global features. The fused embeddings are subsequently input into a multilayer perceptron (MLP) classifier for final prediction. Experimental results on a benchmark dataset indicate that PGCLODA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models in AUROC, AUPRC, and accuracy. Ablation and hyperparameter studies confirm the contribution of each module. Case studies further validate the generalization ability of PGCLODA and its potential to uncover novel, biologically relevant associations. These findings offer valuable insights for mechanism-driven discovery and oligopeptide-based drug development. The source code of PGCLODA is available online at https://github.com/jjnlcode/PGCLODA.",

Yet this task remains difficult due to the complex, high dimensional nature of microstructural features. Relying on physics based simulations to probe the microstructural space is computationally prohibitive. This motivates the development of computational tools to efficiently learn structure property linkages governing mechanical behavior. While contemporary data driven approaches offer new possibilities, they often require large datasets. To address this challenge, this work presents the Extended Low Rank Approximation (xLRA), a framework that employs canonical polyadic tensor decomposition. It efficiently maps high dimensional microstructural information to the local elastic response by adaptively incorporating higher rank terms. xLRA accurately predicts the local elastic strain fields in porous microstructures, requiring a maximum rank of only 4. The compact formulation of xLRA achieves accurate predictions when trained on just 5% of the dataset, demonstrating significant data efficiency. Moreover, xLRA proves transferability by delivering results across representative material systems, including two phase composites and single and dual phase polycrystals. Despite being compact, xLRA retains essential microstructural details, enabling accurate predictions on unseen microstructures. Benchmarking shows that xLRA outperforms contemporary methods in predictive accuracy, generalizability, and computational efficiency, while requiring 6 orders of magnitude fewer floating point operations. In summary, xLRA provides an efficient framework for predicting the elastic response from microstructures, enabling scalable mapping of structure property linkages.",

In this paper, we propose a hybrid training methodology that enables efficient on-device domain adaptation by combining the strengths of Backpropagation and Predictive Coding. The method begins with a deep neural network trained offline using Backpropagation to achieve high initial performance. Subsequently, Predictive Coding is employed for online adaptation, allowing the model to recover accuracy lost due to shifts in the input data distribution. This approach leverages the robustness of Backpropagation for initial representation learning and the computational efficiency of Predictive Coding for continual learning, making it particularly well-suited for resource-constrained edge devices or future neuromorphic accelerators. Experimental results on the MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate that this hybrid strategy enables effective adaptation with a reduced computational overhead, offering a promising solution for maintaining model performance in dynamic environments.",

Our experiments find that Maximum Entropy RL consistently exhibits overoptimization and unstable KL dynamics, even at very low learning rates. Unlike KL-constrained methods that maintain stable training, entropy regularization fails to prevent reward hacking and appears to correlate with overoptimization.

To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid forecasting framework that integrates dynamic lagged feature engineering and adaptive rolling-window representations with classical statistical models and ensemble learners. Our approach explicitly incorporates invoice-level behavioral modeling, structured lag of support data, and custom stability-aware loss functions, enabling robust forecasts in sparse and irregular financial settings. Empirical results demonstrate an approximate 5% reduction in MAPE compared to baseline models, translating into substantial financial savings. Furthermore, the framework enhances forecast stability over quarterly horizons and strengthens feature target correlation by capturing both short- and long-term patterns, leveraging user profile attributes, and simulating upcoming invoice behaviors.

Many public estimates are inconsistent and overstate energy use, because they extrapolate from limited benchmarks and fail to reflect efficiency gains achievable at scale. In this perspective, we introduce a bottom-up methodology to estimate the per-query energy of large-scale LLM systems based on token throughput. For models running on an H100 node under realistic workloads, GPU utilization and PUE constraints, we estimate a median energy per query of 0.34 Wh (IQR: 0.18-0.67) for frontier-scale models (>200 billion parameters). These results are consistent with measurements using production-scale configurations and show that non-production estimates and assumptions can overstate energy use by 4-20x. Extending to test-time scaling scenarios with 15x more tokens per typical query, the median energy rises 13x to 4.32 Wh, indicating that targeting efficiency in this regime will deliver the largest fleet-wide savings. We quantify achievable efficiency gains at the model, serving platform, and hardware levels, finding individual median reductions of 1.5-3.5x in energy per query, while combined advances can plausibly deliver 8-20x reductions. To illustrate the system-level impact, we estimate the baseline daily energy use of a deployment serving 1 billion queries to be 0.8 GWh/day. If 10% are long queries, demand could grow to 1.8 GWh/day. With targeted efficiency interventions, it falls to 0.9 GWh/day, similar to the energy footprint of web search at that scale. This echoes how data centers historically tempered energy growth through efficiency gains during the internet and cloud build-up.",

Accurate classification of ncRNAs is essential for functional annotation and disease diagnosis. To address existing limitations in feature extraction depth and multimodal fusion, we propose HGMamba-ncRNA, a HyperGraphMamba-based multichannel adaptive model, which integrates sequence, secondary structure, and optionally available expression features of ncRNAs to enhance classification performance. Specifically, the sequence of ncRNA is modeled using a parallel Multi-scale Convolution and LSTM architecture (MKC-L) to capture both local patterns and long-range dependencies of nucleotides. The structure modality employs a multi-scale graph transformer (MSGraphTransformer) to represent the multi-level topological characteristics of ncRNA secondary structures. The expression modality utilizes a Chebyshev Polynomial-based Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (CPKAN) to effectively model and interpret high-dimensional expression profiles. Finally, by incorporating virtual nodes to facilitate efficient and comprehensive multimodal interaction, HyperGraphMamba is proposed to adaptively align and integrate multichannel heterogeneous modality features. Experiments conducted on three public datasets demonstrate that HGMamba-ncRNA consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and other metrics. Extensive empirical studies further confirm the model's robustness, effectiveness, and strong transferability, offering a novel and reliable strategy for complex ncRNA functional classification.

        "summary": "Current LLM unlearning methods face a critical security vulnerability that undermines their fundamental purpose: while they appear to successfully remove sensitive or harmful knowledge, this ``forgotten\" information remains precariously recoverable through relearning attacks. We identify that the root cause is that conventional methods optimizing the forgetting loss at individual data points will drive model parameters toward sharp minima in the loss landscape. In these unstable regions, even minimal parameter perturbations can drastically alter the model's behaviors. Consequently, relearning attacks exploit this vulnerability by using just a few fine-tuning samples to navigate the steep gradients surrounding these unstable regions, thereby rapidly recovering knowledge that was supposedly erased. This exposes a critical robustness gap between apparent unlearning and actual knowledge removal. To address this issue, we propose StableUN, a bi-level feedback-guided optimization framework that explicitly seeks more stable parameter regions via neighborhood-aware optimization. It integrates forgetting feedback, which uses adversarial perturbations to probe parameter neighborhoods, with remembering feedback to preserve model utility, aligning the two objectives through gradient projection. Experiments on WMDP and MUSE benchmarks demonstrate that our method is significantly more robust against both relearning and jailbreaking attacks while maintaining competitive utility performance.",

        "summary": "We study weight-only post-training quantization (PTQ), which quantizes the weights of a large language model (LLM) without retraining, using little or no calibration data. Weight-only PTQ is crucial for reducing the memory footprint and latency of LLM inference, especially in memory-bound, small-batch inference scenarios, such as personalized inference on edge devices. Despite its importance, irregular weight distributions with heavy-tailed outliers in LLMs complicate quantization, recently motivating rotation-based methods that transform weights into near-Gaussian distributions, which are more regular with fewer outliers, thereby reducing quantization error. In this work, we first derive the information-theoretically optimal bit allocation for Gaussianized weights under given bit budgets, revealing that fine-grained fractional-bit quantizers approaching the Gaussian distortion-rate bound are essential to achieve near-optimal quantization performance. To bridge this theoretical insight and practical implementation, we introduce Q-Palette, a versatile collection of fractional-bit quantizers that range from trellis-coded quantizers offering near-optimal distortion to simpler vector and scalar quantizers optimized for faster inference, all efficiently implemented with optimized CUDA kernels across various bitwidths. Furthermore, leveraging Q-Palette as a foundational component, we propose a novel mixed-scheme quantization framework, jointly optimizing quantizer choices and layer fusion decisions given resource constraints.

To learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets called TSympNets is introduced in [3]. The aim of this work is to do a similar extension for HénonNets. We propose a novel neural network architecture called T-HénonNets, which is symplectic by design and can handle adaptive time steps. We also extend the T-HénonNet architecture to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. Additionally, we provide universal approximation theorems for both new architectures for separable Hamiltonian systems and discuss why it is difficult to handle non-separable Hamiltonian systems with the proposed methods.

However, previous research mostly considered the addition of ambient noise in the input space, without considering the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose several methods of adding geometry-aware input noise that accounts for the lower dimensional manifold the input space inhabits. We start by projecting ambient Gaussian noise onto the tangent space of the manifold. In a second step, the noise sample is mapped on the manifold via the associated geodesic curve. We also consider Brownian motion noise, which moves in random steps along the manifold. We show that geometry-aware noise leads to improved generalization and robustness to hyperparameter selection on highly curved manifolds, while performing at least as well as training without noise on simpler manifolds. Our proposed framework extends to learned data manifolds.",

        "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) has been extensively employed for a number of applications in machine learning, i.e., primarily owing to its privacy preserving nature and efficiency in mitigating the communication overhead. Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is one of the promising applications, wherein FL can be utilized to train a model more efficiently. Since only a subset of the clients can participate in each FL training round, challenges arise pertinent to fairness in the client selection process. Over the years, a number of researchers from both academia and industry have proposed numerous FL frameworks. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of them have employed fairness for FL-based client selection in a dynamic and heterogeneous IoV environment. Accordingly, in this paper, we envisage a FairEquityFL framework to ensure an equitable opportunity for all the clients to participate in the FL training process. In particular, we have introduced a sampling equalizer module within the selector component for ensuring fairness in terms of fair collaboration opportunity for all the clients in the client selection process. The selector is additionally responsible for both monitoring and controlling the clients' participation in each FL training round. Moreover, an outlier detection mechanism is enforced for identifying malicious clients based on the model performance in terms of considerable fluctuation in either accuracy or loss minimization. The selector flags suspicious clients and temporarily suspend such clients from participating in the FL training process. We further evaluate the performance of FairEquityFL on a publicly available dataset, FEMNIST. Our simulation results depict that FairEquityFL outperforms baseline models to a considerable extent.",

        "summary": "Effective anomaly detection in time series is pivotal for modern industrial applications and financial systems. Due to the scarcity of anomaly labels and the high cost of manual labeling, reconstruction-based unsupervised approaches have garnered considerable attention. However, accurate anomaly detection remains an unsettled challenge, since the optimization objectives of reconstruction-based methods merely rely on point-by-point distance measures, ignoring the potential structural characteristics of time series and thus failing to tackle complex pattern-wise anomalies. In this paper, we propose StrAD, a novel structure-enhanced anomaly detection approach to enrich the optimization objective by incorporating structural information hidden in the time series and steering the data reconstruction procedure to better capture such structural features. StrAD accommodates the trend, seasonality, and shape in the optimization objective of the reconstruction model to learn latent structural characteristics and capture the intrinsic pattern variation of time series. The proposed structure-aware optimization objective mechanism can assure the alignment between the original data and the reconstructed data in terms of structural features, thereby keeping consistency in global fluctuation and local characteristics. The mechanism is pluggable and applicable to any reconstruction-based methods, enhancing the model sensitivity to both point-wise anomalies and pattern-wise anomalies. Experimental results show that StrAD improves the performance of state-of-the-art reconstruction-based models across five real-world anomaly detection datasets.",

Recent generative MIAs utilize generative adversarial networks to learn image priors that guide the inversion process, yielding reconstructions with high visual quality and strong fidelity to the private training data. To explore the reason behind their effectiveness, we begin by examining the gradients of inversion loss with respect to synthetic inputs, and find that these gradients are surprisingly noisy. Further analysis reveals that generative inversion implicitly denoises these gradients by projecting them onto the tangent space of the generator manifold, filtering out off-manifold components while preserving informative directions aligned with the manifold. Our empirical measurements show that, in models trained with standard supervision, loss gradients often exhibit large angular deviations from the data manifold, indicating poor alignment with class-relevant directions. This observation motivates our central hypothesis: models become more vulnerable to MIAs when their loss gradients align more closely with the generator manifold. We validate this hypothesis by designing a novel training objective that explicitly promotes such alignment. Building on this insight, we further introduce a training-free approach to enhance gradient-manifold alignment during inversion, leading to consistent improvements over state-of-the-art generative MIAs.",

We propose a set of probability signatures that reflect the semantic relationships among tokens. Through experiments on the composite addition tasks using the linear model and feedforward network, combined with theoretical analysis of gradient flow dynamics, we reveal that these probability signatures significantly influence the embedding structures. We further generalize our analysis to large language models (LLMs) by training the Qwen2.5 architecture on the subsets of the Pile corpus. Our results show that the probability signatures are faithfully aligned with the embedding structures, particularly in capturing strong pairwise similarities among embeddings.

Second, we introduce the novel problem of ARM in high-dimensional, low-data settings, such as gene expression data from the biomedicine domain with around 18k features and 50 samples.

This formulation enables accurate imputation across arbitrary observation patterns without requiring complete data supervision.

Yomo replaces Pauli expectation-value outputs with a probability aggregation mechanism and introduces loss functions that encourage sharp predictions. Our theoretical analysis shows that Yomo avoids the shot-scaling limitations inherent to expectation-based models, and our experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 confirm that Yomo consistently outperforms baselines across different shot budgets and under simulations with depolarizing channels.

Like many applications of RL to real-world problems, partial observability presents a major challenge, as it invalidates the Markov property present in Markov Decision Processes (MDPs). Partially Observable MDPs require history aggregation or belief state estimation to learn successful policies. We investigate stochastic, partially observable penetration testing scenarios over host networks of varying size, aiming to better reflect real-world complexity through more challenging and representative benchmarks. This approach leads to the development of more robust and transferable policies, which are crucial for ensuring reliable performance across diverse and unpredictable real-world environments. Using vanilla Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as a baseline, we compare a selection of PPO variants designed to mitigate partial observability, including frame-stacking, augmenting observations with historical information, and employing recurrent or transformer-based architectures. We conduct a systematic empirical analysis of these algorithms across different host network sizes. We find that this task greatly benefits from history aggregation. Converging three times faster than other approaches.

We present Pi-Transformer, a physics-informed transformer with two attention pathways: a data-driven series attention and a smoothly evolving prior attention that encodes temporal invariants such as scale-related self-similarity and phase synchrony. The prior acts as a stable reference that calibrates reconstruction error. During training, we pair a reconstruction objective with a divergence term that encourages agreement between the two attentions while keeping them meaningfully distinct; the prior is regularised to evolve smoothly and is lightly distilled towards dataset-level statistics. At inference, the model combines an alignment-weighted reconstruction signal (Energy) with a mismatch signal that highlights timing and phase disruptions, and fuses them into a single score for detection. Across five benchmarks (SMD, MSL, SMAP, SWaT, and PSM), Pi-Transformer achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive F1, with particular strength on timing and phase-breaking anomalies. Case analyses show complementary behaviour of the two streams and interpretable detections around regime changes. Embedding physics-informed priors into attention yields a calibrated and robust approach to anomaly detection in complex multivariate systems.

        "summary": "Clinical diagnosis is a highly specialized discipline requiring both domain expertise and strict adherence to rigorous guidelines. While current AI-driven medical research predominantly focuses on knowledge graphs or natural text pretraining paradigms to incorporate medical knowledge, these approaches primarily rely on implicitly encoded knowledge within model parameters, neglecting task-specific knowledge required by diverse downstream tasks. To address this limitation, we propose Retrieval-Augmented Diagnosis (RAD), a novel framework that explicitly injects external knowledge into multimodal models directly on downstream tasks. Specifically, RAD operates through three key mechanisms: retrieval and refinement of disease-centered knowledge from multiple medical sources, a guideline-enhanced contrastive loss that constrains the latent distance between multi-modal features and guideline knowledge, and the dual transformer decoder that employs guidelines as queries to steer cross-modal fusion, aligning the models with clinical diagnostic workflows from guideline acquisition to feature extraction and decision-making. Moreover, recognizing the lack of quantitative evaluation of interpretability for multimodal diagnostic models, we introduce a set of criteria to assess the interpretability from both image and text perspectives. Extensive evaluations across four datasets with different anatomies demonstrate RAD's generalizability, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, RAD enables the model to concentrate more precisely on abnormal regions and critical indicators, ensuring evidence-based, trustworthy diagnosis.

In this study, we propose OPLoRA, a memory-efficient optimizer that closes this gap by casting LoRA optimization as an interpretable sub-problem and solving it efficiently with alternating least squares updates, where 1-2 alternating steps are empirically found to be sufficient to closely match truncated SVD without ever forming the full matrix. We also retrieve the recently proposed preconditioning methods for LoRA as a special case. OPLoRA supports momentum by maintaining a low-rank estimate using the same subroutine (LoRSum) for computing the step, with a memory budget of 3 times the number of LoRA parameters (i.e., same as Adam). We also propose an experimental scaled variant that uses the K-FAC metric, which could be of interest. Across a linear task, MNIST, CIFAR-100, and RoBERTa-base (MNLI), OPLoRA consistently approaches SVDLoRA's performance using significantly less memory.",

However, this paradigm suffers from inherent limitations, such as lacking explicit probabilities, inadequate coverage, and high computational costs. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{Probabilistic Scenarios}, an alternative paradigm designed to address the limitations of sampling. It operates by directly producing a finite set of \\{Scenario, Probability\\} pairs, thus avoiding Monte Carlo-like approximation. To validate this paradigm, we propose \\textbf{TimePrism}, a simple model composed of only three parallel linear layers. Surprisingly, TimePrism achieves 9 out of 10 state-of-the-art results across five benchmark datasets on two metrics. The effectiveness of our paradigm comes from a fundamental reframing of the learning objective. Instead of modeling an entire continuous probability space, the model learns to represent a set of plausible scenarios and corresponding probabilities. Our work demonstrates the potential of the Probabilistic Scenarios paradigm, opening a promising research direction in forecasting beyond sampling.",

        "summary": "Discrete diffusion models (DDMs) have shown powerful generation ability for discrete data modalities like text and molecules. However, their practical application is hindered by inefficient sampling, requiring a large number of sampling steps. Accelerating DDMs by using larger step sizes typically introduces significant problems in generation quality, as it amplifies the impact of both the compounding decoding error due to factorized predictions and discretization error from numerical approximations, leading to a significant decrease in sampling quality. To address these challenges, we propose learnable sampler distillation (LSD), a novel approach to train fast and high-fidelity samplers for DDMs. LSD employs a distillation approach where a student sampler with a few steps learns to align its intermediate score trajectory with that of a high-quality teacher sampler with numerous steps. This alignment is achieved by optimizing learnable sampler coefficients that adaptively adjust sampling dynamics. Additionally, we further propose LSD+, which also learns time schedules that allocate steps non-uniformly. Experiments across text generation, image generation, and synthetic tasks demonstrate that our proposed approaches outperform existing samplers for DDMs, achieving substantially higher sampling quality with significantly fewer sampling steps.

Generative models have recently emerged as a promising approach to mitigate bias at the data level while preserving utility. However, many rely on deep architectures, despite evidence that simpler models can be highly effective for tabular data. In this work, we introduce TABFAIRGDT, a novel method for generating fair synthetic tabular data using autoregressive decision trees. To enforce fairness, we propose a soft leaf resampling technique that adjusts decision tree outputs to reduce bias while preserving predictive performance. Our approach is non-parametric, effectively capturing complex relationships between mixed feature types, without relying on assumptions about the underlying data distributions. We evaluate TABFAIRGDT on benchmark fairness datasets and demonstrate that it outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) deep generative models, achieving better fairness-utility trade-off for downstream tasks, as well as higher synthetic data quality. Moreover, our method is lightweight, highly efficient, and CPU-compatible, requiring no data pre-processing. Remarkably, TABFAIRGDT achieves a 72% average speedup over the fastest SOTA baseline across various dataset sizes, and can generate fair synthetic data for medium-sized datasets (10 features, 10K samples) in just one second on a standard CPU, making it an ideal solution for real-world fairness-sensitive applications.",

Our investigation reveals a key limitation: while VLMs can infer high-level objectives from visual input, they consistently fail at precise low-level control: the \"knowing-doing gap\". To analyze a potential bridge for this gap, we investigate a simple on-policy hybrid framework in a controlled, best-case scenario. Our results in this idealized setting show that VLM guidance can significantly improve early-stage sample efficiency, providing a clear analysis of the potential and constraints of using foundation models to guide exploration rather than for end-to-end control.",

While most research assumes a basic averaging approach, we demonstrate that advanced techniques, including those designed to handle unreliable or diverse clients, can unintentionally yet significantly alter the final scores. Second, we explore vulnerabilities posed by poisoning attacks, where malicious participants strategically manipulate their model updates to inflate their own contribution scores or reduce the importance of other participants. Through extensive experiments across diverse datasets and model architectures, implemented within the Flower framework, we rigorously show that both the choice of aggregation method and the presence of attackers are potent vectors for distorting contribution scores, highlighting a critical need for more robust evaluation schemes.",

Existing methods trained from scratch often fail to overcome overfitting and mode collapse, and fine-tuning large models can inherit biases while neglecting the crucial geometric structure of the latent space. To address these limitations, we introduce Latent Iterative Refinement Flow (LIRF), a novel approach that reframes few-shot generation as the progressive densification of geometrically structured manifold. LIRF establishes a stable latent space using an autoencoder trained with our novel \\textbf{manifold-preservation loss} $L_{\\text{manifold}}$. This loss ensures that the latent space maintains the geometric and semantic correspondence of the input data. Building on this, we propose an iterative generate-correct-augment cycle. Within this cycle, candidate samples are refined by a geometric \\textbf{correction operator}, a provably contractive mapping that pulls samples toward the data manifold while preserving diversity. We also provide the \\textbf{Convergence Theorem} demonstrating a predictable decrease in Hausdorff distance between generated and true data manifold. We also demonstrate the framework's scalability by generating coherent, high-resolution images on AFHQ-Cat. Ablation studies confirm that both the manifold-preserving latent space and the contractive correction mechanism are critical components of this success. Ultimately, LIRF provides a solution for data-scarce generative modeling that is not only theoretically grounded but also highly effective in practice.",

        "summary": "We study pure exploration in structured stochastic multi-armed bandits, aiming to efficiently identify the correct hypothesis from a finite set of alternatives. For a broad class of tasks, asymptotic analyses reduce to a maximin optimization that admits a two-player zero-sum game interpretation between an experimenter and a skeptic: the experimenter allocates measurements to rule out alternatives while the skeptic proposes alternatives. We reformulate the game by allowing the skeptic to adopt a mixed strategy, yielding a concave-convex saddle-point problem. This viewpoint leads to Frank-Wolfe Self-Play (FWSP): a projection-free, regularization-free, tuning-free method whose one-hot updates on both sides match the bandit sampling paradigm. However, structural constraints introduce sharp pathologies that complicate algorithm design and analysis: our linear-bandit case study exhibits nonunique optima, optimal designs with zero mass on the best arm, bilinear objectives, and nonsmoothness at the boundary. We address these challenges via a differential-inclusion argument, proving convergence of the game value for best-arm identification in linear bandits. Our analysis proceeds through a continuous-time limit: a differential inclusion with a Lyapunov function that decays exponentially, implying a vanishing duality gap and convergence to the optimal value. Although Lyapunov analysis requires differentiability of the objective, which is not guaranteed on the boundary, we show that along continuous trajectories the algorithm steers away from pathological nonsmooth points and achieves uniform global convergence to the optimal game value. We then embed the discrete-time updates into a perturbed flow and show that the discrete game value also converges. Building on FWSP, we further propose a learning algorithm based on posterior sampling. Numerical experiments demonstrate a vanishing duality gap.",

While scaling parameters and test-time computation has driven progress, a key bottleneck is the lack of high-quality training problems: human-curated datasets are costly and limited, while existing synthetic corpora are often too easy or narrow. PromptCoT 1.0 showed that injecting rationales into prompt synthesis increases problem difficulty. Building on this, we present PromptCoT 2.0, a scalable framework that replaces hand-crafted heuristics with an expectation-maximization (EM) loop, where rationales are iteratively refined to guide prompt construction. This produces problems that are both harder and more diverse than prior corpora. The synthetic prompts support two post-training regimes: (1) Self-Play, where strong models improve autonomously via verifiable feedback without stronger teachers; and (2) Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), where weaker models learn from teacher-distilled traces. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach. In self-play, applying PromptCoT 2.0 to Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 sets new state-of-the-art results at the 30B scale, with +4.4, +4.8, and +5.3 on AIME 24/25 and HMMT 25, +6.1 and +5.0 on LiveCodeBench v5/v6, and +35 Elo on Codeforces.

Analyses further confirm that PromptCoT 2.0 yields fundamentally harder and distributionally distinct problems. These results establish prompt synthesis as a new axis for scaling reasoning and position PromptCoT 2.0 as a scalable foundation for future open-source models.

On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of \"ghost states\" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects.

        "summary": "The effectiveness of machine learning models, particularly in unbalanced classification tasks, is often hindered by the failure to differentiate between critical instances near the decision boundary and redundant samples concentrated in the core of the data distribution. In this paper, we propose a method to systematically identify and differentiate between these two types of data. Through extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets, we show that the boundary data oversampling method improves the F1 score by up to 10\\% on 96\\% of the datasets, whereas our core-aware reduction method compresses datasets up to 90\\% while preserving their accuracy, making it 10 times more powerful than the original dataset. Beyond imbalanced classification, our method has broader implications for efficient model training, particularly in computationally expensive domains such as Large Language Model (LLM) training. By prioritizing high-quality, decision-relevant data, our approach can be extended to text, multimodal, and self-supervised learning scenarios, offering a pathway to faster convergence, improved generalization, and significant computational savings. This work paves the way for future research in data-efficient learning, where intelligent sampling replaces brute-force expansion, driving the next generation of AI advancements.

Transformer-based models have emerged as a promising, scalable approach shifting the expensive combinatorial search to a large-scale pre-training phase. However, the success of these models is critically dependent on their pre-training data. Their ability to generalize to problems outside of this pre-training distribution remains largely unexplored. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical study to evaluate the generalization capabilities of pre-trained, transformer-based symbolic regression. We rigorously test performance both within the pre-training distribution and on a series of out-of-distribution challenges for several state of the art approaches. Our findings reveal a significant dichotomy: while pre-trained models perform well in-distribution, the performance consistently degrades in out-of-distribution scenarios. We conclude that this generalization gap is a critical barrier for practitioners, as it severely limits the practical use of pre-trained approaches for real-world applications.",

        "summary": "Boreal forests store 30-40% of terrestrial carbon, much in climate-vulnerable permafrost soils, making their management critical for climate mitigation. However, optimizing forest management for both carbon sequestration and permafrost preservation presents complex trade-offs that current tools cannot adequately address. We introduce $\\textbf{BoreaRL}$, the first multi-objective reinforcement learning environment for climate-adaptive boreal forest management, featuring a physically-grounded simulator of coupled energy, carbon, and water fluxes. BoreaRL supports two training paradigms: site-specific mode for controlled studies and generalist mode for learning robust policies under environmental stochasticity. Through evaluation of multi-objective RL algorithms, we reveal a fundamental asymmetry in learning difficulty: carbon objectives are significantly easier to optimize than thaw (permafrost preservation) objectives, with thaw-focused policies showing minimal learning progress across both paradigms. In generalist settings, standard preference-conditioned approaches fail entirely, while a naive curriculum learning approach achieves superior performance by strategically selecting training episodes. Analysis of learned strategies reveals distinct management philosophies, where carbon-focused policies favor aggressive high-density coniferous stands, while effective multi-objective policies balance species composition and density to protect permafrost while maintaining carbon gains. Our results demonstrate that robust climate-adaptive forest management remains challenging for current MORL methods, establishing BoreaRL as a valuable benchmark for developing more effective approaches. We open-source BoreaRL to accelerate research in multi-objective RL for climate applications.",

However, existing rollout-based reinforcement learning methods (GRPO, DAPO, GSPO, etc.) fail to explicitly consider LLMs' learning ability for samples of different difficulty levels, which is contrary to the human cognitive process of mathematical reasoning tasks from easy to difficult. Intuitively, we find that the variance of the rollout group's reward in RLVR partly reflects the difficulty of the current sample for LLMs. Samples that are too easy or too difficult have a lower variance, while samples with moderate difficulty have a higher variance. Based on this, we propose VCRL, a curriculum reinforcement learning framework that dynamically controls the difficulty of training samples based on the variance of group rewards. Experiments on five mathematical benchmarks and two models reveal the advantages of VCRL over the current LLM RL baselines.",

We propose RDAR, a strategy to learn per-agent relevance -- how much each agent influences the behavior of the controlled vehicle -- by identifying which agents can be excluded from the input to a pre-trained behavior model. We formulate the masking procedure as a Markov Decision Process where the action consists of a binary mask indicating agent selection. We evaluate RDAR on a large-scale driving dataset, and demonstrate its ability to learn an accurate numerical measure of relevance by achieving comparable driving performance, in terms of overall progress, safety and performance, while processing significantly fewer agents compared to a state of the art behavior model.",

        "summary": "Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has become a preferred architecture for scaling Transformer capacity without increasing computational cost, as it activates only a small subset of experts for each input. However, deploying such an approach for \\textit{online inference} remains challenging due to the large size of a full SMoE model and the complexity of expert routing, especially in resource-constrained edge networks. Moreover, during the online inference, task information is often unavailable, making the task-level routing error-prone. In this work, we propose a novel tree-structured adaptive neural bandit router, \\texttt{Tanbr}, to enable efficient and reliable online MoE inference. Instead of relying on explicit task tags, \\texttt{Tanbr} estimates the task distribution over time from historical data and uses it to guide task-aware expert merging within a given pre-trained MoE. To handle the large continuous space of merging weights, \\texttt{Tanbr} employs a binary tree to progressively partition the space and generate finer candidate weights. It then applies a neural bandit to learn the non-linear mapping from merging weight to model performance and decides optimal expert merging. We prove that \\texttt{Tanbr} achieves a sublinear regret bound of {\\small $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T} \\log(T))$} over {\\small $T$} rounds, despite operating over a continuous decision space, matching regret bounds compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments show that \\texttt{Tanbr} reduces inference latency by at least {\\small $45\\%$} and memory usage by up to {\\small $25\\%$}, while maintaining a high accuracy compared to many state-of-the-art methods.",

Generative models present a promising approach to translate PPG into clinically valuable ECG signals, yet current methods face substantial challenges, including the misalignment of physiological semantics in generative models and the complexity of modeling in high-dimensional signals. To this end, we propose PPGFlowECG, a two-stage framework that aligns PPG and ECG in a shared latent space via the CardioAlign Encoder and employs latent rectified flow to generate ECGs with high fidelity and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to experiment on MCMED, a newly released clinical-grade dataset comprising over 10 million paired PPG-ECG samples from more than 118,000 emergency department visits with expert-labeled cardiovascular disease annotations. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method for PPG-to-ECG translation and cardiovascular disease detection.

        "summary": "Surgical decision-making is complex and requires understanding causal relationships between patient characteristics, interventions, and outcomes. In high-stakes settings like spinal fusion or scoliosis correction, accurate estimation of individualized treatment effects (ITEs) remains limited due to the reliance on traditional statistical methods that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. In this study, we develop a multi-task meta-learning framework, X-MultiTask, for ITE estimation that models each surgical decision (e.g., anterior vs. posterior approach, surgery vs. no surgery) as a distinct task while learning shared representations across tasks. To strengthen causal validity, we incorporate the inverse probability weighting (IPW) into the training objective. We evaluate our approach on two datasets: (1) a public spinal fusion dataset (1,017 patients) to assess the effect of anterior vs. posterior approaches on complication severity; and (2) a private AIS dataset (368 patients) to analyze the impact of posterior spinal fusion (PSF) vs. non-surgical management on patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Our model achieves the highest average AUC (0.84) in the anterior group and maintains competitive performance in the posterior group (0.77). It outperforms baselines in treatment effect estimation with the lowest overall $\\epsilon_{\\text{NN-PEHE}}$ (0.2778) and $\\epsilon_{\\text{ATE}}$ (0.0763). Similarly, when predicting PROs in AIS, X-MultiTask consistently shows superior performance across all domains, with $\\epsilon_{\\text{NN-PEHE}}$ = 0.2551 and $\\epsilon_{\\text{ATE}}$ = 0.0902. By providing robust, patient-specific causal estimates, X-MultiTask offers a powerful tool to advance personalized surgical care and improve patient outcomes.

We prove that this rule achieves second-order convergence on full-batch problems, cuts distributed iteration complexity, and remains accurate with rank-limited attention.

Instead we introduce two complementary criteria: a batch-size-aware gradient-noise bound and a curvature volatility-controlled bound that combine into a per-layer predictive threshold that anticipates trainability behavior. Using this threshold, we build a simple per-layer scheduler that keeps each layers effective step below a safe limit, stabilizing training and improving accuracy across concatenated ReLU (CReLU), Wasserstein regularization, and L2 weight decay, with learned learning-rate trajectories that mirror canonical decay.",

        "summary": "Federated continual learning (FCL) tackles scenarios of learning from continuously emerging task data across distributed clients, where the key challenge lies in addressing both temporal forgetting over time and spatial forgetting simultaneously. Recently, prompt-based FCL methods have shown advanced performance through task-wise prompt communication.In this study, we underscore that the existing prompt-based FCL methods are prone to class-wise knowledge coherence between prompts across clients. The class-wise knowledge coherence includes two aspects: (1) intra-class distribution gap across clients, which degrades the learned semantics across prompts, (2) inter-prompt class-wise relevance, which highlights cross-class knowledge confusion. During prompt communication, insufficient class-wise coherence exacerbates knowledge conflicts among new prompts and induces interference with old prompts, intensifying both spatial and temporal forgetting. To address these issues, we propose a novel Class-aware Client Knowledge Interaction (C${}^2$Prompt) method that explicitly enhances class-wise knowledge coherence during prompt communication. Specifically, a local class distribution compensation mechanism (LCDC) is introduced to reduce intra-class distribution disparities across clients, thereby reinforcing intra-class knowledge consistency. Additionally, a class-aware prompt aggregation scheme (CPA) is designed to alleviate inter-class knowledge confusion by selectively strengthening class-relevant knowledge aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple FCL benchmarks demonstrate that C${}^2$Prompt achieves state-of-the-art performance.

        "summary": "Public healthcare datasets of Chest X-Rays (CXRs) have long been a popular benchmark for developing computer vision models in healthcare. However, strong average-case performance of machine learning (ML) models on these datasets is insufficient to certify their clinical utility. In this paper, we use clinical context, as captured by prior discharge summaries, to provide a more holistic evaluation of current ``state-of-the-art'' models for the task of CXR diagnosis. Using discharge summaries recorded prior to each CXR, we derive a ``prior'' or ``pre-test'' probability of each CXR label, as a proxy for existing contextual knowledge available to clinicians when interpreting CXRs. Using this measure, we demonstrate two key findings: First, for several diagnostic labels, CXR models tend to perform best on cases where the pre-test probability is very low, and substantially worse on cases where the pre-test probability is higher. Second, we use pre-test probability to assess whether strong average-case performance reflects true diagnostic signal, rather than an ability to infer the pre-test probability as a shortcut. We find that performance drops sharply on a balanced test set where this shortcut does not exist, which may indicate that much of the apparent diagnostic power derives from inferring this clinical context. We argue that this style of analysis, using context derived from clinical notes, is a promising direction for more rigorous and fine-grained evaluation of clinical vision models.",

However, due to different evaluation metrics, these methods do not work well when transferred to numerical data. In particular, we need to prevent the probability mass from being misplaced far away. In this paper, we propose a new approach that express the sample distribution using wavelet expansions. The coefficients of wavelet series are estimated under LDP. Our method prioritizes the estimation of low-order coefficients, in order to ensure accurate estimation at macroscopic level. Therefore, the probability mass is prevented from being misplaced too far away from its ground truth. We establish theoretical guarantees for our methods.

In this paper, we specifically focus on data distribution shift caused by different human behaviors and propose a self-supervised learning framework that is aware of the bag-of-symbol representation. The bag-of-symbol representation is known for its insensitivity to data warping, location shifts, and noise existed in time series data, making it potentially pivotal in guiding deep learning to acquire a representation resistant to such data shifting.

Existing time series forecasting methods often ignore or unidirectionally model spatial correlation when conducting large-scale global station forecasting. This contradicts the intrinsic nature underlying observations of the global weather system, limiting forecast performance. To address this, we propose a novel Spatial Structured Attention Block in this paper. It partitions the spatial graph into a set of subgraphs and instantiates Intra-subgraph Attention to learn local spatial correlation within each subgraph, and aggregates nodes into subgraph representations for message passing among the subgraphs via Inter-subgraph Attention -- considering both spatial proximity and global correlation. Building on this block, we develop a multiscale spatiotemporal forecasting model by progressively expanding subgraph scales. The resulting model is both scalable and able to produce structured spatial correlation, and meanwhile, it is easy to implement. The experimental results show that it can achieve performance improvements up to 16.8% over time series forecasting baselines at low running costs.",

Unlike static data generation, synthesizing time series requires modeling both the marginal distribution of observations and the conditional temporal dependencies that govern sequential dynamics. We propose TIMED, a unified generative framework that integrates a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) to capture global structure via a forward-reverse diffusion process, a supervisor network trained with teacher forcing to learn autoregressive dependencies through next-step prediction, and a Wasserstein critic that provides adversarial feedback to ensure temporal smoothness and fidelity. To further align the real and synthetic distributions in feature space, TIMED incorporates a Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) loss, promoting both diversity and sample quality. All components are built using masked attention architectures optimized for sequence modeling and are trained jointly to effectively capture both unconditional and conditional aspects of time series data. Experimental results across diverse multivariate time series benchmarks demonstrate that TIMED generates more realistic and temporally coherent sequences than state-of-the-art generative models.",

Among these, Mamba has emerged as a leading architecture, achieving state-of-the-art results across a range of language modeling tasks. However, Mamba's performance significantly deteriorates when applied to contexts longer than those seen during pre-training, revealing a sharp sensitivity to context length extension. Through detailed analysis, we attribute this limitation to the out-of-distribution behaviour of its state-space dynamics, particularly within the parameterization of the state transition matrix $\\mathbf{A}$. Unlike recent works which attribute this sensitivity to the vanished accumulation of discretization time steps, $\\exp(-\\sum_{t=1}^N\\Delta_t)$, we establish a connection between state convergence behavior as the input length approaches infinity and the spectrum of the transition matrix $\\mathbf{A}$, offering a well-founded explanation of its role in length extension. Next, to overcome this challenge, we propose an approach that applies spectrum scaling to pre-trained Mamba models to enable robust long-context generalization by selectively modulating the spectrum of $\\mathbf{A}$ matrices in each layer. We show that this can significantly improve performance in settings where simply modulating $\\Delta_t$ fails, validating our insights and providing avenues for better length generalization of state-space models with structured transition matrices.",

        "summary": "Indexing time series by creating compact binary representations is a fundamental task in time series data mining. Recently, deep learning-based hashing methods have proven effective for indexing time series based on semantic meaning rather than just raw similarity. The purpose of deep hashing is to map samples with the same semantic meaning to identical binary hash codes, enabling more efficient search and retrieval. Unlike other supervised representation learning methods, supervised deep hashing requires a discretization step to convert real-valued representations into binary codes, but this can induce significant information loss. In this paper, we propose a von Mises-Fisher (vMF) hashing loss. The proposed deep hashing model maps data to an M-dimensional hyperspherical space to effectively reduce information loss and models each data class as points following distinct vMF distributions. The designed loss aims to maximize the separation between each modeled vMF distribution to provide a better way to maximize the margin between each semantically different data sample.

While these complex formats can expand disease applicability and improve safety, they present a significant engineering challenge: the function and stability of individual domains are not guaranteed in the novel format, and the entire molecule may no longer be synthesizable. To address these challenges, we develop a machine learning framework to predict \"reformatting success\" -- whether converting an antibody from one format to another will succeed or not. Our framework incorporates both antibody sequence and structural context, incorporating an evaluation protocol that reflects realistic deployment scenarios. In experiments on a real-world antibody reformatting dataset, we find the surprising result that large pretrained protein language models (PLMs) fail to outperform simple, domain-tailored, multimodal representations. This is particularly evident in the most difficult evaluation setting, where we test model generalization to a new starting antibody. In this challenging \"new antibody, no data\" scenario, our best multimodal model achieves high predictive accuracy, enabling prioritization of promising candidates and reducing wasted experimental effort.",

Learning the modules' input/output functions is also necessary for designing new systems from different composition architectures. Here, we propose a modular learning framework, which incorporates prior knowledge of the system's compositional structure to (a) identify the composing modules' input/output functions from the system's input/output data and (b) achieve this by using a reduced amount of data compared to what would be required without knowledge of the compositional structure. To achieve this, we introduce the notion of modular identifiability, which allows recovery of modules' input/output functions from a subset of the system's input/output data, and provide theoretical guarantees on a class of systems motivated by genetic circuits. We demonstrate the theory on computational studies showing that a neural network (NNET) that accounts for the compositional structure can learn the composing modules' input/output functions and predict the system's output on inputs outside of the training set distribution. By contrast, a neural network that is agnostic of the structure is unable to predict on inputs that fall outside of the training set distribution. By reducing the need for experimental data and allowing module identification, this framework offers the potential to ease the design of synthetic biological circuits and of multi-module systems more generally.",

While prior work has explored joint modeling of states, rewards, and actions to address this issue, such formulations often lead to increased training complexity and reduced performance in practice. We propose \\textbf{DAWM}, a diffusion-based world model that generates future state-reward trajectories conditioned on the current state, action, and return-to-go, paired with an inverse dynamics model (IDM) for efficient action inference. This modular design produces complete synthetic transitions suitable for one-step TD-based offline RL, enabling effective and computationally efficient training.

MCFM trains via conditional flow matching on short transitions, avoiding long rollout adjoints. In inference, a Strang-prox scheme alternates a symplectic update with a proximal metric step, ensuring discrete energy decay; an optional projection enforces strict decay when a trusted energy is available. We provide continuous and discrete time guarantees linking this parameterization and sampler to conservation, monotonic dissipation, and stable rollouts.

To enhance expressivity, we further utilize EdgeDiT, a Diffusion Transformer with edge-aware attention. On the QM9 dataset, GFD with EdgeDiT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a test NLL of -137.97 at standard scale and -141.85 at double scale, alongside atom stability of 98.98%, and molecular stability of 90.51%.

        "summary": "Variable count is among the main scalability bottlenecks for transformer modeling in multivariate time series (MTS) data. On top of this, a growing consensus in the field points to indiscriminate inter-variable mixing as a potential source of noise-accumulation and performance degradation. This is likely exacerbated by sparsity of informative signals characteristic of many MTS systems coupled with representational misalignment stemming from indiscriminate information mixing between (heterogeneous) variables. While scalability and performance are often seen as competing interests in transformer design, we show that both can be improved simultaneously in MTS by strategically constraining the representational capacity of inter-variable mixing. Our proposed method, transformer with Delegate Token Attention (DELTAformer), constrains inter-variable modeling through what we call delegate tokens which are then used to perform full, unconstrained, inter-temporal modeling. Delegate tokens act as an implicit regularizer that forces the model to be highly selective about what inter-variable information is allowed to propagate through the network. Our results show that DELTAformer scales linearly with variable-count while actually outperforming standard transformers, achieving state-of-the-art performance across benchmarks and baselines. In addition, DELTAformer can focus on relevant signals better than standard transformers in noisy MTS environments and overall exhibit superior noise-resilience. Overall, results across various experiments confirm that by aligning our model design to leverage domain-specific challenges in MTS to our advantage, DELTAformer can simultaneously achieve linear scaling while actually improving its performance against standard, quadratic transformers.",

        "summary": "Cross-frequency transfer learning (CFTL) has emerged as a popular framework for curating large-scale time series datasets to pre-train foundation forecasting models (FFMs). Although CFTL has shown promise, current benchmarking practices fall short of accurately assessing its performance. This shortcoming stems from many factors: an over-reliance on small-scale evaluation datasets; inadequate treatment of sample size when computing summary statistics; reporting of suboptimal statistical models; and failing to account for non-negligible risks of overlap between pre-training and test datasets. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified reimplementation of widely-adopted neural forecasting networks, adapting them for the CFTL setup; we pre-train only on proprietary and synthetic data, being careful to prevent test leakage; and we evaluate on 15 large, diverse public forecast competition datasets. Our empirical analysis reveals that statistical models' accuracy is frequently underreported. Notably, we confirm that statistical models and their ensembles consistently outperform existing FFMs by more than 8.2% in sCRPS, and by more than 20% MASE, across datasets. However, we also find that synthetic dataset pre-training does improve the accuracy of a FFM by 7% percent.",

        "summary": "Despite achieving excellent performance on benchmarks, deep neural networks often underperform in real-world deployment due to sensitivity to minor, often imperceptible shifts in input data, known as distributional shifts. These shifts are common in practical scenarios but are rarely accounted for during evaluation, leading to inflated performance metrics. To address this gap, we propose a novel methodology for the verification, evaluation, and risk assessment of deep learning systems. Our approach explicitly models the incidence of distributional shifts at runtime by estimating their probability from outputs of out-of-distribution detectors. We combine these estimates with conditional probabilities of network correctness, structuring them in a binary tree. By traversing this tree, we can compute credible and precise estimates of network accuracy. We assess our approach on five different datasets, with which we simulate deployment conditions characterized by differing frequencies of distributional shift. Our approach consistently outperforms conventional evaluation, with accuracy estimation errors typically ranging between 0.01 and 0.1. We further showcase the potential of our approach on a medical segmentation benchmark, wherein we apply our methods towards risk assessment by associating costs with tree nodes, informing cost-benefit analyses and value-judgments. Ultimately, our approach offers a robust framework for improving the reliability and trustworthiness of deep learning systems, particularly in safety-critical applications, by providing more accurate performance estimates and actionable risk assessments.",

        "summary": "Precise probabilistic forecasts are fundamental for energy risk management, and there is a wide range of both statistical and machine learning models for this purpose. Inherent to these probabilistic models is some form of uncertainty quantification. However, most models do not capture the full extent of uncertainty, which arises not only from the data itself but also from model and distributional choices. In this study, we examine uncertainty quantification in state-of-the-art statistical and deep learning probabilistic forecasting models for electricity price forecasting in the German market. In particular, we consider deep distributional neural networks (DDNNs) and augment them with an ensemble approach, Monte Carlo (MC) dropout, and conformal prediction to account for model uncertainty. Additionally, we consider the LASSO-estimated autoregressive (LEAR) approach combined with quantile regression averaging (QRA), generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH), and conformal prediction. Across a range of performance metrics, we find that the LEAR-based models perform well in terms of probabilistic forecasting, irrespective of the uncertainty quantification method. Furthermore, we find that DDNNs benefit from incorporating both data and model uncertainty, improving both point and probabilistic forecasting. Uncertainty itself appears to be best captured by the models using conformal prediction. Overall, our extensive study shows that all models under consideration perform competitively. However, their relative performance depends on the choice of metrics for point and probabilistic forecasting.",

        "summary": "This study examines credit default prediction by comparing three techniques, namely SMOTE, SMOTE-Tomek, and ADASYN, that are commonly used to address the class imbalance problem in credit default situations. Recognizing that credit default datasets are typically skewed, with defaulters comprising a much smaller proportion than non-defaulters, we began our analysis by evaluating machine learning (ML) models on the imbalanced data without any resampling to establish baseline performance. These baseline results provide a reference point for understanding the impact of subsequent balancing methods. In addition to traditional classifiers such as Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), our study also explores the suitability of advanced ensemble boosting algorithms, including Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM), and Light GBM for credit default prediction using Boruta feature selection and DBSCAN-based outlier detection, both before and after resampling. A real-world credit default data set sourced from the University of Cleveland ML Repository was used to build ML classifiers, and their performances were tested. The criteria chosen to measure model performance are the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC), G-mean, and F1-scores. The results from this empirical study indicate that the Boruta+DBSCAN+SMOTE-Tomek+GBM classifier outperformed the other ML models (F1-score: 82.56%, G-mean: 82.98%, ROC-AUC: 90.90%, PR-AUC: 91.85%) in a credit default context. The findings establish a foundation for future progress in creating more resilient and adaptive credit default systems, which will be essential as credit-based transactions continue to rise worldwide.",

However, existing patch-based methods typically adopt fixed-length segmentation, overlooking the heterogeneity of local temporal dynamics and the decoding heterogeneity of forecasting. Such designs lose details in information-dense regions, introduce redundancy in stable segments, and fail to capture the distinct complexities of short-term and long-term horizons. We propose TimeMosaic, a forecasting framework that aims to address temporal heterogeneity. TimeMosaic employs adaptive patch embedding to dynamically adjust granularity according to local information density, balancing motif reuse with structural clarity while preserving temporal continuity. In addition, it introduces segment-wise decoding that treats each prediction horizon as a related subtask and adapts to horizon-specific difficulty and information requirements, rather than applying a single uniform decoder. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate that TimeMosaic delivers consistent improvements over existing methods, and our model trained on the large-scale corpus with 321 billion observations achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art TSFMs.",

In this paper, we present a framework for LfO and use it to survey and classify existing LfO methods in terms of their trajectory construction, assumptions and algorithm's design choices. This survey also draws connections between several related fields like offline RL, model-based RL and hierarchical RL.

To solve this problem, in this paper, a new hybrid analysis method is presented by using the Enhanced ANFIS. The model proposes several advances of the conventional ANFIS framework and employs a multi-resolution wavelet decomposition module and a temporal attention mechanism. The model performs discrete wavelet transformations on historical transaction data and macroeconomic indicators to generate localized economic shock signals. The transformed features are then fed into a deep fuzzy rule library which is based on Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules with adaptive Gaussian membership functions. The model proposes a temporal attention encoder that adaptively assigns weights to multi-scale economic behavior patterns, increasing the effectiveness of relevance assessment in the fuzzy inference stage and enhancing the capture of long-term temporal dependencies and anomalies caused by fraudulent activities. The proposed method differs from classical ANFIS which has fixed input-output relations since it integrates fuzzy rule activation with the wavelet basis selection and the temporal correlation weights via a modular training procedure.

Our evaluation across three biometric gaze datasets shows that DeepACTIF not only preserves predictive performance under severe feature reduction (top 10% of features) but also significantly outperforms established methods, including SHAP, IG, and DeepLIFT, in terms of both accuracy and statistical robustness. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank tests and effect size analysis, we demonstrate that DeepACTIF yields more informative feature rankings with significantly lower error across all top-k conditions (10 - 40%). Our experiments demonstrate that DeepACTIF not only reduces computation time and memory usage by orders of magnitude but also preserves model accuracy when using only top-ranked features.

The paper explores the pivotal role played by Anti-Money Laundering (AML) activities in the global financial industry. It underscores the drawbacks of conventional AML systems, which exhibit high rates of false positives and lack the sophistication to uncover intricate money laundering schemes. To tackle these challenges, the paper proposes an advanced AML system that capitalizes on link analysis using deep learning techniques. At the heart of this system lies the utilization of centrality algorithms like Degree Centrality, Closeness Centrality, Betweenness Centrality, and PageRank. These algorithms enhance the system's capability to identify suspicious activities by examining the influence and interconnections within networks of financial transactions. The significance of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts within the global financial sector is discussed in this paper. It highlights the limitations of traditional AML systems. The results showed the practicality and superiority of the new implementation of the GCN model, which is a preferable method for connectively structured data, meaning that a transaction or account is analyzed in the context of its financial environment. In addition, the paper delves into the prospects of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) efforts, proposing the integration of emerging technologies such as deep learning and centrality algorithms.

We first observe that time-domain-only approaches inadvertently introduce shifts in the low-frequency components of the frequency domain, which results in trajectory instability and degraded performance. To address this issue, we propose Wavelet Fourier Diffuser (WFDiffuser), a novel diffusion-based RL framework that integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform to decompose trajectories into low- and high-frequency components. To further enhance diffusion modeling for each component, WFDiffuser employs Short-Time Fourier Transform and cross attention mechanisms to extract frequency-domain features and facilitate cross-frequency interaction. Extensive experiment results on the D4RL benchmark demonstrate that WFDiffuser effectively mitigates frequency shift, leading to smoother, more stable trajectories and improved decision-making performance over existing methods.",

The error of our method remains below a user-specified bound without any distributional assumptions on the synthetic data, and decreases as the quality of the synthetic data improves. This flexibility enables seamless integration with conformal prediction, risk control, hypothesis testing, and multiple testing procedures, all without modifying the base inference method. We demonstrate the benefits of our method on challenging tasks with limited labeled data, including AlphaFold protein structure prediction, and comparing large reasoning models on complex math problems.",

        "summary": "Humanoid loco-manipulation in unstructured environments demands tight integration of egocentric perception and whole-body control. However, existing approaches either depend on external motion capture systems or fail to generalize across diverse tasks. We introduce VisualMimic, a visual sim-to-real framework that unifies egocentric vision with hierarchical whole-body control for humanoid robots. VisualMimic combines a task-agnostic low-level keypoint tracker -- trained from human motion data via a teacher-student scheme -- with a task-specific high-level policy that generates keypoint commands from visual and proprioceptive input. To ensure stable training, we inject noise into the low-level policy and clip high-level actions using human motion statistics. VisualMimic enables zero-shot transfer of visuomotor policies trained in simulation to real humanoid robots, accomplishing a wide range of loco-manipulation tasks such as box lifting, pushing, football dribbling, and kicking. Beyond controlled laboratory settings, our policies also generalize robustly to outdoor environments. Videos are available at: https://visualmimic.github.io .",

        "summary": "Optimizing the timing and frequency of ads is a central problem in digital advertising, with significant economic consequences. Existing scheduling policies rely on simple heuristics, such as uniform spacing and frequency caps, that overlook long-term user interest. However, it is well-known that users' long-term interest and engagement result from the interplay of several psychological effects (Curmei, Haupt, Recht, Hadfield-Menell, ACM CRS, 2022). In this work, we model change in user interest upon showing ads based on three key psychological principles: mere exposure, hedonic adaptation, and operant conditioning. The first two effects are modeled using a concave function of user interest with repeated exposure, while the third effect is modeled using a temporal decay function, which explains the decline in user interest due to overexposure. Under our psychological behavior model, we ask the following question: Given a continuous time interval $T$, how many ads should be shown, and at what times, to maximize the user interest towards the ads? Towards answering this question, we first show that, if the number of displayed ads is fixed, then the optimal ad-schedule only depends on the operant conditioning function. Our main result is a quasi-linear time algorithm that outputs a near-optimal ad-schedule, i.e., the difference in the performance of our schedule and the optimal schedule is exponentially small. Our algorithm leads to significant insights about optimal ad placement and shows that simple heuristics such as uniform spacing are sub-optimal under many natural settings. The optimal number of ads to display, which also depends on the mere exposure and hedonistic adaptation functions, can be found through a simple linear search given the above algorithm. We further support our findings with experimental results, demonstrating that our strategy outperforms various baselines.",

We show the severity of this tradeoff at the evaluation level and analyze where popular metrics fall within it. Essentially, current metrics generally lean toward adequacy, meaning that their scores correlate more strongly with the adequacy of translations than with fluency. More importantly, we find that this tradeoff also persists at the meta-evaluation level, and that the standard WMT meta-evaluation favors adequacy-oriented metrics over fluency-oriented ones. We show that this bias is partially attributed to the composition of the systems included in the meta-evaluation datasets. To control this bias, we propose a method that synthesizes translation systems in meta-evaluation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding this tradeoff in meta-evaluation and its impact on metric rankings.",

We start formulating the control problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the mathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The associate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations combining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The regression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), exploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are introduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our value function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and rigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze how this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a relatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate how our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing of American options.",

To address these limitations, we propose a domain-agnostic framework that quantifies feature reliance through systematic suppression of shape, texture, and color cues, avoiding the confounds of forced-choice conflicts. By evaluating humans and neural networks under controlled suppression conditions, we find that CNNs are not inherently texture-biased but predominantly rely on local shape features. Nonetheless, this reliance can be substantially mitigated through modern training strategies or architectures (ConvNeXt, ViTs). We further extend the analysis across computer vision, medical imaging, and remote sensing, revealing that reliance patterns differ systematically: computer vision models prioritize shape, medical imaging models emphasize color, and remote sensing models exhibit a stronger reliance towards texture.

        "summary": "Visual language modeling for automated driving is emerging as a promising research direction with substantial improvements in multimodal reasoning capabilities. Despite its advanced reasoning abilities, VLM-AD remains vulnerable to serious security threats from adversarial attacks, which involve misleading model decisions through carefully crafted perturbations. Existing attacks have obvious challenges: 1) Physical adversarial attacks primarily target vision modules. They are difficult to directly transfer to VLM-AD systems because they typically attack low-level perceptual components. 2) Adversarial attacks against VLM-AD have largely concentrated on the digital level. To address these challenges, we propose the first Universal Camouflage Attack (UCA) framework for VLM-AD. Unlike previous methods that focus on optimizing the logit layer, UCA operates in the feature space to generate physically realizable camouflage textures that exhibit strong generalization across different user commands and model architectures. Motivated by the observed vulnerability of encoder and projection layers in VLM-AD, UCA introduces a feature divergence loss (FDL) that maximizes the representational discrepancy between clean and adversarial images. In addition, UCA incorporates a multi-scale learning strategy and adjusts the sampling ratio to enhance its adaptability to changes in scale and viewpoint diversity in real-world scenarios, thereby improving training stability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UCA can induce incorrect driving commands across various VLM-AD models and driving scenarios, significantly surpassing existing state-of-the-art attack methods (improving 30\\% in 3-P metrics). Furthermore, UCA exhibits strong attack robustness under diverse viewpoints and dynamic conditions, indicating high potential for practical deployment.",

PINNs are widely accepted as inferior to traditional methods for solving PDEs, such as the finite element method, both with regard to computation time and accuracy. However, PINNs are commonly claimed to show promise in solving inverse problems and handling noisy or incomplete data. We compare the performance of PINNs in solving inverse problems with that of a traditional approach using the finite element method combined with a numerical optimizer. The models are tested on a series of increasingly difficult fluid mechanics problems, with and without noise. We find that while PINNs may require less human effort and specialized knowledge, they are outperformed by the traditional approach. However, the difference appears to decrease with higher dimensions and more data. We identify common failures during training to be addressed if the performance of PINNs on noisy inverse problems is to become more competitive.",

The compute for pre-training LLMs has been growing at an unprecedented rate, while the availability of high-quality data remains limited. Consequently, maximizing the utility of available data constitutes a significant research challenge. A primary impediment is that certain high-quality tokens are difficult to learn given a fixed model capacity, as the underlying rationale for a single token can be exceptionally complex and deep. To address this issue, we propose Thinking augmented Pre-Training (TPT), a universal methodology that augments text with automatically generated thinking trajectories. Such augmentation effectively increases the volume of the training data and makes high-quality tokens more learnable through step-by-step reasoning and decomposition. We apply TPT across diverse training configurations up to $100$B tokens, encompassing pre-training with both constrained and abundant data, as well as mid-training from strong open-source checkpoints. Experimental results indicate that our method substantially improves the performance of LLMs across various model sizes and families. Notably, TPT enhances the data efficiency of LLM pre-training by a factor of $3$. For a $3$B parameter model, it improves the post-training performance by over $10\\%$ on several challenging reasoning benchmarks.",

Standard meta-learning approaches aim to solve this by selecting an algorithm based on user features, but treat the fundamentally diverse algorithms themselves as equivalent, \"black-box\" choices. This thesis investigates the impact of overcoming this limitation by engineering a comprehensive feature set to explicitly characterize the algorithms themselves. We combine static code metrics, Abstract Syntax Tree properties, behavioral performance landmarks, and high-level conceptual features. We evaluate two meta-learners across five datasets: a baseline using only user features and our proposed model using both user and algorithm features. Our results show that the meta-learner augmented with algorithm features achieves an average NDCG@10 of 0.143, a statistically significant improvement of 11.7% over the Single Best Algorithm baseline (0.128). However, we found that the inclusion of algorithm features did not lead to an improvement in overall NDCG@10 over the meta learner using only user features (0.144). While adding algorithm features to the meta-learner did improve its Top-1 selection accuracy (+16.1%), this was counterbalanced by leading to a lower Top-3 accuracy (-10.7%). We conclude that for the per-user algorithm selection task in recommender systems, the predictive power of user features is overwhelmingly dominant. While algorithm features improve selection precision, unlocking their potential to boost overall performance remains a non-trivial challenge.",

We believe that dynamic, secure monitoring of the IIoT environment can be achieved through integration with the Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Digital Twin (DT) paradigms. The current literature lacks implementation details for SDN-based DT and time-aware intelligent model training for short-term anomaly detection against IIoT threats. Therefore, we have proposed a novel framework for short-term anomaly detection that uses an SDN-based DT. Using a comprehensive dataset, time-aware labeling of features, and a comprehensive evaluation of various machine learning models, we propose a novel SD-TWIN-based anomaly detection algorithm. According to the performance of a new real-time SD-TWIN deployment, the GPU- accelerated LightGBM model is particularly effective, achieving a balance of high recall and strong classification performance.",

        "summary": "Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) relocate learnable nonlinearities from nodes to edges, demonstrating remarkable capabilities in scientific machine learning and interpretable modeling. However, current KAN implementations suffer from fundamental inefficiencies due to redundancy in high-dimensional spline parameter spaces, where numerous distinct parameterisations yield functionally equivalent behaviors. This redundancy manifests as a \"nuisance space\" in the model's Jacobian, leading to susceptibility to overfitting and poor generalization. We introduce Projective Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (P-KANs), a novel training framework that guides edge function discovery towards interpretable functional representations through entropy-minimisation techniques from signal analysis and sparse dictionary learning. Rather than constraining functions to predetermined spaces, our approach maintains spline space flexibility while introducing \"gravitational\" terms that encourage convergence towards optimal functional representations. Our key insight recognizes that optimal representations can be identified through entropy analysis of projection coefficients, compressing edge functions to lower-parameter projective spaces (Fourier, Chebyshev, Bessel). P-KANs demonstrate superior performance across multiple domains, achieving up to 80% parameter reduction while maintaining representational capacity, significantly improved robustness to noise compared to standard KANs, and successful application to industrial automated fiber placement prediction. Our approach enables automatic discovery of mixed functional representations where different edges converge to different optimal spaces, providing both compression benefits and enhanced interpretability for scientific machine learning applications.",

Uncontrolled user captures of these high-entropy patterns cause high false rejection rates, creating a significant 'reliability gap'. To bridge this gap, we depart from traditional perceptual IQA and introduce a framework that predictively estimates a frame's utility for the downstream verification task. We propose a lightweight model to predict a quality score for a video frame, determining its suitability for a resource-intensive oracle model. Our framework is validated using re-contextualized FNMR and ISRR metrics on a large-scale dataset of 32,000+ images from 105 smartphones. Furthermore, a novel cross-domain analysis on graphics from different industrial printing presses reveals a key finding: a lightweight probe on a frozen, ImageNet-pretrained network generalizes better to an unseen printing technology than a fully fine-tuned model. This provides a key insight for real-world generalization: for domain shifts from physical manufacturing, a frozen general-purpose backbone can be more robust than full fine-tuning, which can overfit to source-domain artifacts.",

We evaluate our method on two benchmark datasets (TableBank-LaTeX, TableBank-Word) using state-of-the-art table detection architectures, CascadeTabNet and YOLOv9.

For small datasets, a memory-bank of normative features can directly be used for anomaly detection which has been demonstrated recently. However, this is unsuitable for large medical datasets as the computational burden increases substantially. Therefore, we propose to model the distribution of normative DINOv2 embeddings with a Dirichlet Process Mixture model (DPMM), a non-parametric mixture model that automatically adjusts the number of mixture components to the data at hand. Rather than using a memory bank, we use the similarity between the component centers and the embeddings as anomaly score function to create a coarse anomaly segmentation mask. Our experiments show that through DPMM embeddings of DINOv2, despite being trained on natural images, achieve very competitive anomaly detection performance on medical imaging benchmarks and can do this while at least halving the computation time at inference. Our analysis further indicates that normalized DINOv2 embeddings are generally more aligned with anatomical structures than unnormalized features, even in the presence of anomalies, making them great representations for anomaly detection.

We propose Biology-Informed Bayesian Optimization (BioBO), a method that integrates Bayesian optimization with multimodal gene embeddings and enrichment analysis, a widely used tool for gene prioritization in biology, to enhance surrogate modeling and acquisition strategies. BioBO combines biologically grounded priors with acquisition functions in a principled framework, which biases the search toward promising genes while maintaining the ability to explore uncertain regions. Through experiments on established public benchmarks and datasets, we demonstrate that BioBO improves labeling efficiency by 25-40%, and consistently outperforms conventional BO by identifying top-performing perturbations more effectively. Moreover, by incorporating enrichment analysis, BioBO yields pathway-level explanations for selected perturbations, offering mechanistic interpretability that links designs to biologically coherent regulatory circuits.",

        "summary": "Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) is paramount for inference in engineering applications. A common inference task is to recover full-field information of physical systems from a small number of noisy observations, a usually highly ill-posed problem. Critically, engineering systems often have complicated and variable geometries prohibiting the use of standard Bayesian UQ. In this work, we introduce Geometric Autoencoders for Bayesian Inversion (GABI), a framework for learning geometry-aware generative models of physical responses that serve as highly informative geometry-conditioned priors for Bayesian inversion. Following a ''learn first, observe later'' paradigm, GABI distills information from large datasets of systems with varying geometries, without requiring knowledge of governing PDEs, boundary conditions, or observation processes, into a rich latent prior. At inference time, this prior is seamlessly combined with the likelihood of the specific observation process, yielding a geometry-adapted posterior distribution. Our proposed framework is architecture agnostic. A creative use of Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) sampling yields an efficient implementation that utilizes modern GPU hardware. We test our method on: steady-state heat over rectangular domains; Reynold-Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) flow around airfoils; Helmholtz resonance and source localization on 3D car bodies; RANS airflow over terrain. We find: the predictive accuracy to be comparable to deterministic supervised learning approaches in the restricted setting where supervised learning is applicable; UQ to be well calibrated and robust on challenging problems with complex geometries. The method provides a flexible geometry-aware train-once-use-anywhere foundation model which is independent of any particular observation process.",

In particular, we design exactly linearizable deep models satisfying these constraints and formulate model predictive control as a convex quadratic program, which yields a unique optimizer and a Lipschitz continuous control law. On a two-tank system and a hybrid powertrain, the proposed approach improves prediction accuracy and produces smoother control inputs than existing methods.",

We propose two distinct monitoring frameworks for online or 'phase II' Statistical Process Control (SPC). The first method leverages state-of-the-art techniques in manifold fitting to accurately approximate the manifold where the data resides within the ambient high-dimensional space. It then monitors deviations from this manifold using a novel scalar distribution-free control chart. In contrast, the second method adopts a more traditional approach, akin to those used in linear dimensionality reduction SPC techniques, by first embedding the data into a lower-dimensional space before monitoring the embedded observations. We prove how both methods provide a controllable Type I error probability, after which they are contrasted for their corresponding fault detection ability. Extensive numerical experiments on a synthetic process and on a replicated Tennessee Eastman Process show that the conceptually simpler manifold-fitting approach achieves performance competitive with, and sometimes superior to, the more classical lower-dimensional manifold monitoring methods. In addition, we demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed manifold-fitting approach by successfully detecting surface anomalies in a real image dataset of electrical commutators.",

In this paper, we introduce a new estimator of $f_0$ that avoids this overfitting by minimizing a penalty on the subgradient while enforcing an upper bound $s_n$ on the sum of squared errors. The key advantage of this method is that $s_n$ can be directly estimated from the data. We establish the uniform almost sure consistency of the proposed estimator and its subgradient over $\\Omega$ as $n \\rightarrow \\infty$ and derive convergence rates.

We systematically vary turn-level reward assignment and trajectory-level score calculation to analyze how different formulations affect learning under the GRPO algorithm. Our experiments across Qwen3 models reveal three key findings: (i) SFT cold start is critical for unlocking initial interaction ability and enabling sustained RL improvements; (ii) deliberate trajectory scoring yields more efficient and effective multi-turn interactions; and (iii) while stronger simulated users (e.g., GPT-4o) facilitates training, open-source simulators (e.g., Qwen3-32B) remain a cost-effective and transferable option. Together, these results highlight that careful design of reward shaping and user simulation choice is as crucial as model scale, and establish UserRL as a practical pathway for developing robust user-centric agentic models.

This captures both translational and rotational task-space behavior. For rotations, we introduce a novel SLERP-based quaternion noise scheduler that ensures geometric consistency. The reconstructed sZFT is then passed to an energy-based estimator that updates stiffness and damping parameters. A directional rule is applied that reduces impedance along non task axes while preserving rigidity along task directions. Training data were collected for a parkour scenario and robotic-assisted therapy tasks using teleoperation with Apple Vision Pro. With only tens of thousands of samples, the model achieved sub-millimeter positional accuracy and sub-degree rotational accuracy. Its compact model size enabled real-time torque control and autonomous stiffness adaptation on a KUKA LBR iiwa robot.

To preserve GMP expressiveness while enabling verification, our key insight is to imitate the GMP by stabilizing references sampled from the GMP with a small neural tracking controller and then applying NNV to the closed-loop dynamics. This yields reachable sets that rigorously certify closed-loop safety, while the controller enforces dynamic feasibility. Building on this, we construct a library of verified GMP references and deploy them online in a way that imitates the original GMP distribution whenever it is safe to do so, improving safety without retraining. We evaluate across diverse planners, including diffusion, flow matching, and vision-language models, improving safety in simulation (on ground robots and quadcopters) and on hardware (differential-drive robot).",

Motivated by recent advances in the reasoning capabilities of large language models, we address two central questions: (i) how can thinking be incorporated into existing audio classification pipelines to enable reasoning in the category space and improve performance, and (ii) can a new architecture be designed from the ground up to support both thinking and test-time scaling? We demonstrate that in both settings, our models exhibit improved classification accuracy. Leveraging test-time scaling, we observe consistent gains as the number of sampled traces increases. Furthermore, we evaluate two open-source reasoning models, GPT-OSS-20B and Qwen3-14B, showing that while such models are capable of zero-shot reasoning, a lightweight approach--retraining only the embedding matrix of a frozen, smaller model like GPT-2--can surpass the performance of billion-parameter text-based reasoning models.",

Classical algorithms such as the perceptron offer efficient updates and finite mistake guarantees on linearly separable data, but they do not exploit the underlying geometric structure of the classification problem. We study the offline maximum margin problem through its dual formulation and use the resulting geometric insights to design a principled and efficient algorithm for the online setting. A key feature of our method is its translation invariance, inherited from the offline formulation, which plays a central role in its performance analysis. Our theoretical analysis yields improved mistake and margin bounds that depend only on translation-invariant quantities, offering stronger guarantees than existing algorithms under the same assumptions in favorable settings. In particular, we identify a parameter regime where our algorithm makes at most two mistakes per sequence, whereas the perceptron can be forced to make arbitrarily many mistakes. Our numerical study on real data further demonstrates that our method matches the computational efficiency of existing online algorithms, while significantly outperforming them in accuracy.",

        "summary": "Effective cloud and cloud shadow detection is a critical prerequisite for accurate retrieval of concentrations of atmospheric methane or other trace gases in hyperspectral remote sensing. This challenge is especially pertinent for MethaneSAT and for its airborne companion mission, MethaneAIR. In this study, we use machine learning methods to address the cloud and cloud shadow detection problem for sensors with these high spatial resolutions instruments. Cloud and cloud shadows in remote sensing data need to be effectively screened out as they bias methane retrievals in remote sensing imagery and impact the quantification of emissions. We deploy and evaluate conventional techniques including Iterative Logistic Regression (ILR) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), with advanced deep learning architectures, namely UNet and a Spectral Channel Attention Network (SCAN) method. Our results show that conventional methods struggle with spatial coherence and boundary definition, affecting the detection of clouds and cloud shadows. Deep learning models substantially improve detection quality: UNet performs best in preserving spatial structure, while SCAN excels at capturing fine boundary details. Notably, SCAN surpasses UNet on MethaneSAT data, underscoring the benefits of incorporating spectral attention for satellite specific features. This in depth assessment of various disparate machine learning techniques demonstrates the strengths and effectiveness of advanced deep learning architectures in providing robust, scalable solutions for clouds and cloud shadow screening towards enhancing methane emission quantification capacity of existing and next generation hyperspectral missions.

Evaluations are often presented as simple measurements, but in reality they are inferences: to treat benchmark scores as evidence of capability is already to assume a theory of what capability is and how it manifests in a test. We make this step explicit by proposing a principled framework for evaluation as inference: begin from a theory of capability, and then derive methods for estimating it. This perspective, familiar in fields such as psychometrics, has not yet become commonplace in AI evaluation. As a proof of concept, we address a central challenge that undermines reliability: sensitivity to perturbations. After formulating a model of ability, we introduce methods that infer ability while accounting for uncertainty from sensitivity and finite samples, including an adaptive algorithm that significantly reduces sample complexity.

We propose MAGIC (Multi-tAsk Gaussian Process for Imputation and Classification), a novel unified framework that simultaneously performs class-informed missing value imputation and label prediction within a hierarchical multi-task Gaussian process coupled with functional logistic regression. To handle intractable likelihood components, MAGIC employs Taylor expansion approximations with bounded error analysis, and parameter estimation is performed using EM algorithm with block coordinate optimization supported by convergence analysis. We validate MAGIC through two healthcare applications: prediction of post-traumatic headache improvement following mild traumatic brain injury and prediction of in-hospital mortality within 48 hours after ICU admission. In both applications, MAGIC achieves superior predictive accuracy compared to existing methods. The ability to generate real-time and accurate predictions with limited samples facilitates early clinical assessment and treatment planning, enabling healthcare providers to make more informed treatment decisions.",

To find the optimal traversal policy, we propose a novel two-stage learning framework. An offline phase learns a robust base policy via optimistic policy iteration augmented with information bonus to encourage exploration in informative regions, followed by an online rollout policy with periodic base updates via a Bayesian mechanism for information adaptation. This framework supports both Monte Carlo point estimation and distributional reinforcement learning (RL) to learn full cost distributions, leading to stronger uncertainty quantification. We establish theoretical benefits of correlation-aware updating and convergence property under posterior sampling.

While this enables the synthesis of latent safety filters for hard-to-model vision-based tasks, they assume that the safety constraint is known a priori and remains fixed during deployment, limiting the safety filter's adaptability across scenarios. To address this, we propose constraint-parameterized latent safety filters that can adapt to user-specified safety constraints at runtime. Our key idea is to define safety constraints by conditioning on an encoding of an image that represents a constraint, using a latent-space similarity measure. The notion of similarity to failure is aligned in a principled way through conformal calibration, which controls how closely the system may approach the constraint representation. The parameterized safety filter is trained entirely within the world model's imagination, treating any image seen by the model as a potential test-time constraint, thereby enabling runtime adaptation to arbitrary safety constraints. In simulation and hardware experiments on vision-based control tasks with a Franka manipulator, we show that our method adapts at runtime by conditioning on the encoding of user-specified constraint images, without sacrificing performance.

While models excel at isolated tasks, the computational limits that govern their reasoning under cognitive load remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a formal theory of computational cognitive load, positing that extraneous, task-irrelevant information (Context Saturation) and interference from task-switching (Attentional Residue) are key mechanisms that degrade performance. We designed the Interleaved Cognitive Evaluation (ICE), a deconfounded benchmark to systematically manipulate these load factors on challenging multi-hop reasoning tasks. A comprehensive study (N = 10 replications per item across 200 questions) revealed significant performance variations across five instruction-tuned models. Smaller open-source architectures (Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2) exhibited baseline brittleness, achieving 0% accuracy (SEM = 0.0) across all conditions, including clean controls, on this high-intrinsic-load task. In contrast, Gemini-2.0-Flash-001 showed partial resilience, achieving 85% accuracy in control conditions, with a statistically significant degradation under context saturation ($\\beta = -0.003$ per % load, $p < 0.001$). These findings provide preliminary evidence that cognitive load is a key contributor to reasoning failures, supporting theories of hallucination-as-guessing under uncertainty. We conclude that dynamic, cognitive-aware stress testing, as exemplified by the ICE benchmark, is essential for evaluating the true resilience and safety of advanced AI systems.",

In contrast, most existing robotic navigation policies are trained on a single modality, limiting their adaptability to real-world scenarios where different forms of goal specification are natural and complementary. In this work, we present a training framework for robotic foundation models that enables omni-modal goal conditioning for vision-based navigation. Our approach leverages a high-capacity vision-language-action (VLA) backbone and trains with three primary goal modalities: 2D poses, egocentric images, and natural language, as well as their combinations, through a randomized modality fusion strategy. This design not only expands the pool of usable datasets but also encourages the policy to develop richer geometric, semantic, and visual representations. The resulting model, OmniVLA, achieves strong generalization to unseen environments, robustness to scarce modalities, and the ability to follow novel natural language instructions. We demonstrate that OmniVLA outperforms specialist baselines across modalities and offers a flexible foundation for fine-tuning to new modalities and tasks. We believe OmniVLA provides a step toward broadly generalizable and flexible navigation policies, and a scalable path for building omni-modal robotic foundation models. We present videos showcasing OmniVLA performance and will release its checkpoints and training code on our project page.",

Existing evaluation approaches frequently suffer from high variance due to limited data and long-horizon tasks, or high bias due to unequal support or inaccurate environmental models. We posit that these challenges arise, in part, from the standard reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm of policy learning without explicit consideration of evaluation. As an alternative, we propose evaluation-aware reinforcement learning (EvA-RL), in which a policy is trained to maximize expected return while simultaneously minimizing expected evaluation error under a given value prediction scheme -- in other words, being \"easy\" to evaluate. We formalize a framework for EvA-RL and design an instantiation that enables accurate policy evaluation, conditioned on a small number of rollouts in an assessment environment that can be different than the deployment environment. However, our theoretical analysis and empirical results show that there is often a tradeoff between evaluation accuracy and policy performance when using a fixed value-prediction scheme within EvA-RL. To mitigate this tradeoff, we extend our approach to co-learn an assessment-conditioned state-value predictor alongside the policy. Empirical results across diverse discrete and continuous action domains demonstrate that EvA-RL can substantially reduce evaluation error while maintaining competitive returns. This work lays the foundation for a broad new class of RL methods that treat reliable evaluation as a first-class principle during training.",

        "summary": "Imitation learning has been a trend recently, yet training a generalist agent across multiple tasks still requires large-scale expert demonstrations, which are costly and labor-intensive to collect. To address the challenge of limited supervision, we propose Self-Evolved Imitation Learning (SEIL), a framework that progressively improves a few-shot model through simulator interactions. The model first attempts tasksin the simulator, from which successful trajectories are collected as new demonstrations for iterative refinement. To enhance the diversity of these demonstrations, SEIL employs dual-level augmentation: (i) Model-level, using an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) model to collaborate with the primary model, and (ii) Environment-level, introducing slight variations in initial object positions. We further introduce a lightweight selector that filters complementary and informative trajectories from the generated pool to ensure demonstration quality. These curated samples enable the model to achieve competitive performance with far fewer training examples. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark show that SEIL achieves a new state-of-the-art performance in few-shot imitation learning scenarios.

However, they face two key limitations: (i) they require differentiable log-densities, excluding targets with non-differentiable components; and (ii) they generally fail to sample heavy-tailed targets. We propose anchored Langevin dynamics, a unified approach that accommodates non-differentiable targets and certain classes of heavy-tailed distributions. The method replaces the original potential with a smooth reference potential and modifies the Langevin diffusion via multiplicative scaling. We establish non-asymptotic guarantees in the 2-Wasserstein distance to the target distribution and provide an equivalent formulation derived via a random time change of the Langevin diffusion. We provide numerical experiments to illustrate the theory and practical performance of our proposed approach.",

However, collecting diverse and precise real-world demonstrations is costly and time-consuming, which hinders scalability. Prior works have addressed this with data augmentation, typically for either eye-in-hand (wrist camera) setups with RGB inputs or for generating novel images without paired actions, leaving augmentation for eye-to-hand (third-person) RGB-D training with new action labels less explored. In this paper, we propose Synthetic Robot Pose Generation for RGB-D Bimanual Data Augmentation (ROPA), an offline imitation learning data augmentation method that fine-tunes Stable Diffusion to synthesize third-person RGB and RGB-D observations of novel robot poses. Our approach simultaneously generates corresponding joint-space action labels while employing constrained optimization to enforce physical consistency through appropriate gripper-to-object contact constraints in bimanual scenarios. We evaluate our method on 5 simulated and 3 real-world tasks. Our results across 2625 simulation trials and 300 real-world trials demonstrate that ROPA outperforms baselines and ablations, showing its potential for scalable RGB and RGB-D data augmentation in eye-to-hand bimanual manipulation.

We present HUNT (High-speed UAV Navigation and Tracking), a real-time framework that unifies traversal, acquisition, and tracking within a single relative formulation. HUNT defines navigation objectives directly from onboard instantaneous observables such as attitude, altitude, and velocity, enabling reactive high-speed flight during search. Once a target is detected, the same perception-control pipeline transitions seamlessly to tracking.

To overcome this limitation, this study proposes an online adaptation algorithm for unseen subjects via dual-stage alignment and self-supervision. The alignment process begins by applying Euclidean alignment in the EEG data space and then updates batch normalization statistics in the representation space. Moreover, a self-supervised loss is designed to update the decoder. The loss is computed by soft pseudo-labels derived from the decoder as a proxy for the unknown ground truth, and is calibrated by Shannon entropy to facilitate self-supervised training. Experiments across five public datasets and seven decoders show the proposed algorithm can be integrated seamlessly regardless of BCI paradigm and decoder architecture. In each iteration, the decoder is updated with a single online trial, which yields average accuracy gains of 4.9% on steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEP) and 3.6% on motor imagery. These results support fast-calibration operation and show that the proposed algorithm has great potential for BCI applications.",

        "summary": "Electroencephalogram (EEG)-based P300 speller brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) face three main challenges: low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), poor generalization, and time-consuming calibration. We propose SpellerSSL, a framework that combines self-supervised learning (SSL) with P300 aggregation to address these issues. First, we introduce an aggregation strategy to enhance SNR. Second, to achieve generalization in training, we employ a customized 1D U-Net backbone and pretrain the model on both cross-domain and in-domain EEG data. The pretrained model is subsequently fine-tuned with a lightweight ERP-Head classifier for P300 detection, which adapts the learned representations to subject-specific data. Our evaluations on calibration time demonstrate that combining the aggregation strategy with SSL significantly reduces the calibration burden per subject and improves robustness across subjects. Experimental results show that SSL learns effective EEG representations in both in-domain and cross-domain, with in-domain achieving a state-of-the-art character recognition rate of 94% with only 7 repetitions and the highest information transfer rate (ITR) of 21.86 bits/min on the public II-B dataset. Moreover, in-domain SSL with P300 aggregation reduces the required calibration size by 60% while maintaining a comparable character recognition rate. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply SSL to P300 spellers, highlighting its potential to improve both efficiency and generalization in speller BCIs and paving the way toward an EEG foundation model for P300 speller BCIs.",

        "summary": "Myocardial infarction is a critical manifestation of coronary artery disease, yet detecting it from single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) remains challenging due to limited spatial information. An intuitive idea is to convert single-lead into multiple-lead ECG for classification by pre-trained models, but generative methods optimized at the signal level in most cases leave a large latent space gap, ultimately degrading diagnostic performance. This naturally raises the question of whether latent space alignment could help. However, most prior ECG alignment methods focus on learning transformation invariance, which mismatches the goal of single-lead detection. To address this issue, we propose SelfMIS, a simple yet effective alignment learning framework to improve myocardial infarction detection from single-lead ECG. Discarding manual data augmentations, SelfMIS employs a self-cutting strategy to pair multiple-lead ECG with their corresponding single-lead segments and directly align them in the latent space. This design shifts the learning objective from pursuing transformation invariance to enriching the single-lead representation, explicitly driving the single-lead ECG encoder to learn a representation capable of inferring global cardiac context from the local signal. Experimentally, SelfMIS achieves superior performance over baseline models across nine myocardial infarction types while maintaining a simpler architecture and lower computational overhead, thereby substantiating the efficacy of direct latent space alignment. Our code and checkpoint will be publicly available after acceptance.",

We present a lightweight hybrid pipeline that couples analytical features with a shallow artificial neural network (ANN) for accurate, patient-specific SWD detection in long-term, monopolar EEG. A two-sided moving-average (MA) filter first suppresses the high-frequency components of normal background activity. The residual signal is then summarised by the mean and the standard deviation of its normally distributed samples, yielding a compact, two-dimensional feature vector for every 20s window. These features are fed to a single-hidden-layer ANN trained via back-propagation to classify each window as SWD or non-SWD. The method was evaluated on 780 channels sampled at 256 Hz from 12 patients, comprising 392 annotated SWD events. It correctly detected 384 events (sensitivity: 98%) while achieving a specificity of 96.2 % and an overall accuracy of 97.2%. Because feature extraction is analytic, and the classifier is small, the pipeline runs in real-time and requires no manual threshold tuning. These results indicate that normal-distribution descriptors combined with a modest ANN provide an effective and computationally inexpensive solution for automated SWD screening in extended EEG recordings.",

While neural network-based electroencephalography (EEG) denoising methods for electromyogenic (EMG) artifacts have improved in recent years, current state-of-the-art (SOTA) models perform suboptimally in settings with high noise. To address the shortcomings of current machine learning (ML)-based denoising algorithms, we present a signal filtration algorithm driven by a new mixture-of-experts (MoE) framework. Our algorithm leverages three new statistical insights into the EEG-EMG denoising problem: (1) EMG artifacts can be partitioned into quantifiable subtypes to aid downstream MoE classification, (2) local experts trained on narrower signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) ranges can achieve performance increases through specialization, and (3) correlation-based objective functions, in conjunction with rescaling algorithms, can enable faster convergence in a neural network-based denoising context. We empirically demonstrate these three insights into EMG artifact removal and use our findings to create a new downstream MoE denoising algorithm consisting of convolutional (CNN) and recurrent (RNN) neural networks. We tested all results on a major benchmark dataset (EEGdenoiseNet) collected from 67 subjects. We found that our MoE denoising model achieved competitive overall performance with SOTA ML denoising algorithms and superior lower bound performance in high noise settings. These preliminary results highlight the promise of our MoE framework for enabling advances in EMG artifact removal for EEG processing, especially in high noise settings. Further research and development will be necessary to assess our MoE framework on a wider range of real-world test cases and explore its downstream potential to unlock more effective neural interfaces.",

A systematic Bayesian hyperparameter search with Optuna identifies the learning rate as the dominant driver of generalization, followed by the scheduler decay and the latent dimension. Using NDBC buoy observations and ERA5 reanalysis over the Hawaii region, AUWave attains a minimum validation loss of 0.043285 and a slightly right-skewed RMSE distribution. Spatial errors are lowest near observation sites and increase with distance, reflecting identifiability limits under sparse sampling. Sensitivity experiments show that AUWave consistently outperforms a representative baseline in data-richer configurations, while the baseline is only marginally competitive in the most underdetermined single-buoy cases. The architecture's multi-scale and attention components translate into accuracy gains when minimal but non-trivial spatial anchoring is available. Error maps and buoy ablations reveal key anchor stations whose removal disproportionately degrades performance, offering actionable guidance for network design.

        "summary": "We present a sensor-fusion framework for rapid, non-destructive classification and quality control of organic substances, built on a standard Arduino Mega 2560 microcontroller platform equipped with three commercial environmental and gas sensors. All data used in this study were generated in-house: sensor outputs for ten distinct classes - including fresh and expired samples of apple juice, onion, garlic, and ginger, as well as cinnamon and cardamom - were systematically collected and labeled using this hardware setup, resulting in a unique, application-specific dataset. Correlation analysis was employed as part of the preprocessing pipeline for feature selection. After preprocessing and dimensionality reduction (PCA/LDA), multiple supervised learning models - including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), and Random Forest (RF), each with hyperparameter tuning, as well as an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and an ensemble voting classifier - were trained and cross-validated on the collected dataset. The best-performing models, including tuned Random Forest, ensemble, and ANN, achieved test accuracies in the 93 to 94 percent range. These results demonstrate that low-cost, multisensory platforms based on the Arduino Mega 2560, combined with advanced machine learning and correlation-driven feature engineering, enable reliable identification and quality control of organic compounds.",

While effective, it often struggles with social media data, which tends to be noisy and sparse, resulting in an excessive number of overlapping topics. Recent work explored the use of large language models for end-to-end topic modelling. However, these approaches typically require significant computational overhead, limiting their scalability in big data contexts. In this work, we propose a framework that combines BERTopic for topic generation with large language models for topic reduction. The method first generates an initial set of topics and constructs a representation for each. These representations are then provided as input to the language model, which iteratively identifies and merges semantically similar topics. We evaluate the approach across three Twitter/X datasets and four different language models. Our method outperforms the baseline approach in enhancing topic diversity and, in many cases, coherence, with some sensitivity to dataset characteristics and initial parameter selection.",

Previous research has focused on projection neuron (PN) to Kenyon cell (KC) connectivity within the MB; we examine how perturbations to the mushroom body circuit structure and changes in connectivity, specifically within the KC to mushroom body output neuron (MBON) neural circuit, affect the MBONs' ability to distinguish between odor classes. We constructed a neural network that incorporates the connectivity between PNs, KCs, and MBONs. To train our model, we generated ten artificial input classes, which represent the projection neuron activity in response to different odors. We collected data on the number of KC-to-MBON connections, MBON error rates, and KC-to-MBON synaptic weights, among other metrics. We observed that MBONs with very few presynaptic KCs consistently performed worse than others in the odor classification task. The developmental types of KCs also played a significant role in each MBON's output. We performed random and targeted KC ablation and observed that ablating developmentally mature KCs had a greater negative impact on MBONs' learning capacity than ablating immature KCs. Random and targeted pruning of KC-MBON synaptic connections yielded results largely consistent with the ablation experiments. To further explore the various types of KCs, we also performed rewiring experiments in the PN to KC circuit. Our study furthers our understanding of olfactory neuroplasticity and provides important clues to understanding learning and memory in general. Understanding how the olfactory circuits process and learn can also have potential applications in artificial intelligence and treatments for neurodegenerative diseases.",

Recent advances in scaling inference time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions. However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension. ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with exceptional sample efficiency.

        "summary": "Localized statistical channel modeling (LSCM) is crucial for effective performance evaluation in digital twin-assisted network optimization. Solely relying on the multi-beam reference signal receiving power (RSRP), LSCM aims to model the localized statistical propagation environment by estimating the channel angular power spectrum (APS). However, existing methods rely heavily on drive test data with high collection costs and limited spatial coverage. In this paper, we propose a measurement report (MR) data-driven framework for LSCM, exploiting the low-cost and extensive collection of MR data. The framework comprises two novel modules. The MR localization module addresses the issue of missing locations in MR data by introducing a semi-supervised method based on hypergraph neural networks, which exploits multi-modal information via distance-aware hypergraph modeling and hypergraph convolution for location extraction. To enhance the computational efficiency and solution robustness, LSCM operates at the grid level. Compared to independently constructing geographically uniform grids and estimating channel APS, the joint grid construction and channel APS estimation module enhances robustness in complex environments with spatially non-uniform data by exploiting their correlation. This module alternately optimizes grid partitioning and APS estimation using clustering and improved sparse recovery for the ill-conditioned measurement matrix and incomplete observations. Through comprehensive experiments on a real-world MR dataset, we demonstrate the superior performance and robustness of our framework in localization and channel modeling.",

        "summary": "6G networks are envisioned to support on-demand AI model downloading to accommodate diverse inference requirements of end users. By proactively caching models at edge nodes, users can retrieve the requested models with low latency for on-device AI inference. However, the substantial size of contemporary AI models poses significant challenges for edge caching under limited storage capacity, as well as for the concurrent delivery of heterogeneous models over wireless channels. To address these challenges, we propose a fine-grained AI model caching and downloading system that exploits parameter reusability, stemming from the common practice of fine-tuning task-specific models from a shared pre-trained model with frozen parameters. This system selectively caches model parameter blocks (PBs) at edge nodes, eliminating redundant storage of reusable parameters across different cached models. Additionally, it incorporates coordinated multipoint (CoMP) broadcasting to simultaneously deliver reusable PBs to multiple users, thereby enhancing downlink spectrum utilization. Under this arrangement, we formulate a model downloading delay minimization problem to jointly optimize PB caching, migration (among edge nodes), and broadcasting beamforming. To tackle this intractable problem, we develop a distributed multi-agent learning framework that enables edge nodes to explicitly learn mutual influence among their actions, thereby facilitating cooperation. Furthermore, a data augmentation approach is proposed to adaptively generate synthetic training samples through a predictive model, boosting sample efficiency and accelerating policy learning. Both theoretical analysis and simulation experiments validate the superior convergence performance of the proposed learning framework.",

The architecture of the network is a two-dimensional convolutional neural network and it includes a parallel module for temporal and spatial domain feature extraction, followed by a feature fusion module. The public PRED+CT database, which includes multi-channel EEG signals from 119 subjects, was selected to verify the constructed network. The results showed that the average correlation coefficient between the generated virtual channel EEG signals and the original real signals was 0.6724, with an average absolute error of 3.9470. Furthermore, the 13 virtual channel EEG signals were combined with the original EEG signals of four brain regions and then used for anxiety classification with a support vector machine. The results indicate that the virtual EEG signals generated by the constructed network not only have a high degree of consistency with the real channel EEG signals but also significantly enhance the performance of machine learning algorithms for anxiety classification.

A dual-headed decoder simultaneously reconstructs the input and predicts task outputs, preventing phase collapse when losses prioritize magnitude over phase. We demonstrate that holographic attention implements a discrete interference operator and maintains phase consistency under linear mixing. Experiments on PolSAR image classification and wireless channel prediction show strong performance, achieving high classification accuracy and F1 scores, low regression error, and increased robustness to phase perturbations. These results highlight that enforcing physical consistency in attention leads to generalizable improvements in complex-valued learning and provides a unified, physics-based framework for coherent signal modeling.

In this paper, we advance the field by demonstrating, for the first time, robust recognition of activity only with ECG in six distinct activities, which is beyond the scope of previous work. We design and evaluate three new deep learning models, including a CNN classifier with Squeeze-and-Excitation blocks for channel-wise feature recalibration, a ResNet classifier with dilated convolutions for multiscale temporal dependency capture, and a novel CNNTransformer hybrid combining convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms for long-range temporal relationship modeling. Tested on data from 54 subjects for six activities, all three models achieve over 94% accuracy for seen subjects, while CNNTransformer hybrid reaching the best accuracy of 72% for unseen subjects, a result that can be further improved by increasing the training population.

        "summary": "Electric vehicle (EV) charging loads identification from behind smart meter recordings is an indispensable aspect that enables effective decision-making for energy distributors to reach an informed and intelligent decision about the power grid's reliability. When EV charging happens behind the meter (BTM), the charging occurs on the customer side of the meter, which measures the overall electricity consumption. In other words, the charging of the EV is considered part of the customer's load and not separately measured by the Distribution Network Operators (DNOs). DNOs require complete knowledge about the EV presence in their network. Identifying the EV charging demand is essential to better plan and manage the distribution grid. Unlike supervised methods, this paper addresses the problem of EV charging load identification in a non-nonintrusive manner from low-frequency smart meter using an unsupervised learning approach based on anomaly detection technique. Our approach does not require prior knowledge of EV charging profiles. It only requires real power consumption data of non-EV users, which are abundant in practice. We propose a deep temporal convolution encoding decoding (TAE) network. The TAE is applied to power consumption from smart BTM from Victorian households in Australia, and the TAE shows superior performance in identifying households with EVs.",

The key to its development lies in the precise prediction of Significant Wave Height (WVHT). However, wave energy signals exhibit strong nonlinearity, abrupt changes, multi-scale periodicity, data sparsity, and high-frequency noise interference; additionally, physical models for wave energy prediction incur extremely high computational costs. To address these challenges, this study proposes a hybrid model combining STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM. This model exploits the Seasonal-Trend Decomposition Procedure based on Loess (STL), Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT), Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) technologies. The model aims to optimize multi-scale feature fusion, capture extreme wave heights, and address issues related to high-frequency noise and periodic signals, thereby achieving efficient and accurate prediction of significant wave height. Experiments were conducted using hourly data from NOAA Station 41008 and 41047 spanning 2019 to 2022. The results showed that compared with other single models and hybrid models, the STL-FFT-STFT-TCN-LSTM model achieved significantly higher prediction accuracy in capturing extreme wave heights and suppressing high-frequency noise, with MAE reduced by 15.8\\%-40.5\\%, SMAPE reduced by 8.3\\%-20.3\\%, and R increased by 1.31\\%-2.9\\%; in ablation experiments, the model also demonstrated the indispensability of each component step, validating its superiority in multi-scale feature fusion.",

Concretely, a projection network built on the MAXIM architecture takes uplink sounding reference signals (SRS) as input and outputs frequency-, beam-, and port-domain projection matrices for designing downlink CSI-RS. User equipment (UE) then compresses/quantizes the resulting CSI-RS observations and feeds back a compact representation. At the base station (BS), two complementary branches produce candidate precoders: one is a feedback-only precoding network driven by quantized downlink observations, and the other is an SRS-only precoding network driven by uplink SRS. These candidate precoders are subsequently combined by a fusion precoding network to yield the final transmit precoder. All the modules are trained with a spectral-efficiency-oriented loss under a three-stage schedule. Simulation results show that the proposed approach effectively harnesses both SRS-derived information and UE feedback, achieving markedly better performance than conventional baselines.",
