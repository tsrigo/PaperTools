        "summary": "As climate change intensifies extreme weather events, water disasters pose growing threats to global communities, making adaptive reservoir management critical for protecting vulnerable populations and ensuring water security. Modern water resource management faces unprecedented challenges from cascading uncertainties propagating through interconnected reservoir networks. These uncertainties, rooted in physical water transfer losses and environmental variability, make precise control difficult. For example, sending 10 tons downstream may yield only 8-12 tons due to evaporation and seepage. Traditional centralized optimization approaches suffer from exponential computational complexity and cannot effectively handle such real-world uncertainties, while existing multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods fail to achieve effective coordination under uncertainty. To address these challenges, we present MARLIN, a decentralized reservoir management framework inspired by starling murmurations intelligence. Integrating bio-inspired alignment, separation, and cohesion rules with MARL, MARLIN enables individual reservoirs to make local decisions while achieving emergent global coordination. In addition, a LLM provides real-time reward shaping signals, guiding agents to adapt to environmental changes and human-defined preferences. Experiments on real-world USGS data show that MARLIN improves uncertainty handling by 23\\%, cuts computation by 35\\%, and accelerates flood response by 68\\%, exhibiting super-linear coordination, with complexity scaling 5.4x from 400 to 10,000 nodes. These results demonstrate MARLIN's potential for disaster prevention and protecting communities through intelligent, scalable water resource management.",

        "summary": "The past two years have witnessed the meteoric rise of Large Language Model (LLM)-powered multi-agent systems (MAS), which harness collective intelligence and exhibit a remarkable trajectory toward self-evolution. This paradigm has rapidly progressed from manually engineered systems that require bespoke configuration of prompts, tools, roles, and communication protocols toward frameworks capable of automated orchestration. Yet, dominant automatic multi-agent systems, whether generated by external modules or a single LLM agent, largely adhere to a rigid ``\\textit{generate-once-and-deploy}'' paradigm, rendering the resulting systems brittle and ill-prepared for the dynamism and uncertainty of real-world environments. To transcend this limitation, we introduce MAS$^2$, a paradigm predicated on the principle of recursive self-generation: a multi-agent system that autonomously architects bespoke multi-agent systems for diverse problems. Technically, we devise a ``\\textit{generator-implementer-rectifier}'' tri-agent team capable of dynamically composing and adaptively rectifying a target agent system in response to real-time task demands. Collaborative Tree Optimization is proposed to train and specialize these meta-agents. Extensive evaluation across seven benchmarks reveals that MAS$^2$ achieves performance gains of up to $19.6\\%$ over state-of-the-art MAS in complex scenarios such as deep research and code generation. Moreover, MAS$^2$ exhibits superior cross-backbone generalization, effectively leveraging previously unseen LLMs to yield improvements of up to $15.1\\%$. Crucially, these gains are attained without incurring excessive token costs, as MAS$^2$ consistently resides on the Pareto frontier of cost-performance trade-offs.

        "summary": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) are increasingly capable of tackling complex real-world tasks, yet their reliance on inter-agent coordination, tool use, and long-horizon reasoning makes error recognition particularly challenging. Minor errors can propagate across agents, escalating into task failures while producing long, intertwined execution trajectories that impose significant costs for both human developers and automated systems to debug and analyze. Our key insight is that, despite surface differences in failure trajectories (e.g., logs), MAS errors often recur with similar structural patterns. This paper presents CORRECT, the first lightweight, training-free framework that leverages an online cache of distilled error schemata to recognize and transfer knowledge of failure structures across new requests. This cache-based reuse allows LLMs to perform targeted error localization at inference time, avoiding the need for expensive retraining while adapting to dynamic MAS deployments in subseconds. To support rigorous study in this domain, we also introduce CORRECT-Error, a large-scale dataset of over 2,000 annotated trajectories collected through a novel error-injection pipeline guided by real-world distributions, and further validated through human evaluation to ensure alignment with natural failure patterns. Experiments across seven diverse MAS applications show that CORRECT improves step-level error localization up to 19.8% over existing advances while at near-zero overhead, substantially narrowing the gap between automated and human-level error recognition.",

While large language models (LLMs) offer strong in-context reasoning capabilities, single-agent or debate-style systems often struggle with scalability and consistency in such settings. We propose PartnerMAS, a hierarchical multi-agent framework that decomposes evaluation into three layers: a Planner Agent that designs strategies, Specialized Agents that perform role-specific assessments, and a Supervisor Agent that integrates their outputs. To support systematic evaluation, we also introduce a curated benchmark dataset of venture capital co-investments, featuring diverse firm attributes and ground-truth syndicates. Across 140 cases, PartnerMAS consistently outperforms single-agent and debate-based multi-agent baselines, achieving up to 10--15\\% higher match rates. Analysis of agent reasoning shows that planners are most responsive to domain-informed prompts, specialists produce complementary feature coverage, and supervisors play an important role in aggregation. Our findings demonstrate that structured collaboration among LLM agents can generate more robust outcomes than scaling individual models, highlighting PartnerMAS as a promising framework for high-dimensional decision-making in data-rich domains.",

        "summary": "Multi-agent systems are prevalent in a wide range of domains including power systems, vehicular networks, and robotics. Two important problems to solve in these types of systems are how the intentions of non-coordinating agents can be determined to predict future behavior and how the agents can achieve their objectives under resource constraints without significantly sacrificing performance. To study this, we develop a model where an autonomous agent observes the environment within a safety radius of observation, determines the state of a surrounding agent of interest (within the observation radius), estimates future actions to be taken, and acts in an optimal way. In the absence of observations, agents are able to utilize an estimation algorithm to predict the future actions of other agents based on historical trajectory. The use of the proposed estimation algorithm introduces uncertainty, which is managed via risk analysis. The proposed approach in this study is validated using two different learning-based decision making frameworks: reinforcement learning and game theoretic algorithms.",

        "summary": "In practical multi-agent systems, agents often have diverse objectives, which makes the system more complex, as each agent's performance across multiple criteria depends on the joint actions of all agents, creating intricate strategic trade-offs. To address this, we introduce the Multi-Objective Markov Game (MOMG), a framework for multi-agent reinforcement learning with multiple objectives. We propose the Pareto-Nash Equilibrium (PNE) as the primary solution concept, where no agent can unilaterally improve one objective without sacrificing performance on another. We prove existence of PNE, and establish an equivalence between the PNE and the set of Nash Equilibria of MOMG's corresponding linearly scalarized games, enabling solutions of MOMG by transferring to a standard single-objective Markov game. However, we note that computing a PNE is theoretically and computationally challenging, thus we propose and study weaker but more tractable solution concepts. Building on these foundations, we develop online learning algorithm that identify a single solution to MOMGs. Furthermore, we propose a two-phase, preference-free algorithm that decouples exploration from planning. Our algorithm enables computation of a PNE for any given preference profile without collecting new samples, providing an efficient methodological characterization of the entire Pareto-Nash front.",

In this work, we address both limitations within an imitation learning framework. First, we shift the typical role of Curriculum Learning in MRS, from scalability with the number of robots, to focus on improving long-term coordination. We propose a curriculum strategy that gradually increases the length of expert trajectories during training, stabilizing learning and enhancing the accuracy of long-term behaviors. Second, we introduce a method to approximate the egocentric perception of each robot using only third-person global state demonstrations. Our approach transforms idealized trajectories into locally available observations by filtering neighbors, converting reference frames, and simulating onboard sensor variability. Both contributions are integrated into a physics-informed technique to produce scalable, distributed policies from observations. We conduct experiments across two tasks with varying team sizes and noise levels. Results show that our curriculum improves long-term accuracy, while our perceptual estimation method yields policies that are robust to realistic uncertainty. Together, these strategies enable the learning of robust, distributed controllers from global demonstrations, even in the absence of expert actions or onboard measurements.",

Contrary to prior approaches that rely on explicit knowledge of defender strategies or utilize conservative safety conditions based on a defender's range, our work characterizes defender threats geometrically through engagement zones that delineate inevitable interception regions. Outside these engagement zones, the interceptor remains invulnerable. The proposed guidance law switches between a repulsive safety maneuver near these zones and a pursuit maneuver outside their influence. To deal with multiple engagement zones, we employ a smooth minimum function (log-sum-exponent approximation) that aggregates threats from all the zones while prioritizing the most critical threats. Input saturation is modeled and embedded in the non-holonomic vehicle dynamics so the controller respects actuator limits while maintaining stability. Numerical simulations with several defenders demonstrate the proposed method's ability to avoid engagement zones and achieve interception across diverse initial conditions.",

        "summary": "This paper presents a framework towards prompting multi-robot teams with high-level tasks using natural language expressions. Our objective is to use the reasoning capabilities demonstrated by recent language models in understanding and decomposing human expressions of intent, and repurpose these for multi-robot collaboration and decision-making. The key challenge is that an individual's behavior in a collective can be hard to specify and interpret, and must continuously adapt to actions from others. This necessitates a framework that possesses the representational capacity required by the logic and semantics of a task, and yet supports decentralized and interactive real-time operation. We solve this dilemma by recognizing that a task can be represented as a deterministic finite automaton (DFA), and that recurrent neural networks (RNNs) can encode numerous automata. This allows us to distill the logic and sequential decompositions of sub-tasks obtained from a language model into an RNN, and align its internal states with the semantics of a given task. By training a graph neural network (GNN) control policy that is conditioned on the hidden states of the RNN and the language embeddings, our method enables robots to execute task-relevant actions in a decentralized manner. We present evaluations of this single light-weight interpretable model on various simulated and real-world multi-robot tasks that require sequential and collaborative behavior by the team -- sites.google.com/view/prompting-teams.",

To overcome this key limitation, we introduce TeraAgent, a distributed agent-based simulation engine. A critical challenge in distributed execution is the exchange of agent information across servers, which we identify as a major performance bottleneck. We propose two solutions: 1) a tailored serialization mechanism that allows agents to be accessed and mutated directly from the receive buffer, and 2) leveraging the iterative nature of agent-based simulations to reduce data transfer with delta encoding. Built on our solutions, TeraAgent enables extreme-scale simulations with half a trillion agents (an 84x improvement), reduces time-to-result with additional compute nodes, improves interoperability with third-party tools, and provides users with more hardware flexibility.",

Leveraging a bi-directional Transformer with a self-supervised masked modeling objective, the model reconstructs missing segments across modalities, enabling it to learn rich semantic correlations without manual labels. Across benchmark datasets, including Numosim-LA, Urban Anomalies, and Geolife, GPS-MTM consistently outperforms on downstream tasks such as trajectory infilling and next-stop prediction. Its advantages are most pronounced in dynamic tasks (inverse and forward dynamics), where contextual reasoning is critical.

However, real-world FL deployment is often hindered by complex operational challenges that demand substantial human efforts. This includes: (a) selecting appropriate clients (hospitals), (b) coordinating between the central server and clients, (c) client-level data pre-processing, (d) harmonizing non-standardized data and labels across clients, and (e) selecting FL algorithms based on user instructions and cross-client data characteristics. However, the existing FL works overlook these practical orchestration challenges. These operational bottlenecks motivate the need for autonomous, agent-driven FL systems, where intelligent agents at each hospital client and the central server agent collaboratively manage FL setup and model training with minimal human intervention. To this end, we first introduce an agent-driven FL framework that captures key phases of real-world FL workflows from client selection to training completion and a benchmark dubbed FedAgentBench that evaluates the ability of LLM agents to autonomously coordinate healthcare FL. Our framework incorporates 40 FL algorithms, each tailored to address diverse task-specific requirements and cross-client characteristics. Furthermore, we introduce a diverse set of complex tasks across 201 carefully curated datasets, simulating 6 modality-specific real-world healthcare environments, viz., Dermatoscopy, Ultrasound, Fundus, Histopathology, MRI, and X-Ray. We assess the agentic performance of 14 open-source and 10 proprietary LLMs spanning small, medium, and large model scales.

Although learning-based methods have made progress in MAPD, they often perform poorly in warehouse-like environments with narrow pathways and long corridors when relying only on local observations for distributed decision-making. Communication learning can alleviate the lack of global information but introduce high computational complexity due to point-to-point communication. To address this challenge, we formulate MAPF as a sequence modeling problem and prove that path-finding policies under sequence modeling possess order-invariant optimality, ensuring its effectiveness in MAPD. Building on this, we propose the Sequential Pathfinder (SePar), which leverages the Transformer paradigm to achieve implicit information exchange, reducing decision-making complexity from exponential to linear while maintaining efficiency and global awareness. Experiments demonstrate that SePar consistently outperforms existing learning-based methods across various MAPF tasks and their variants, and generalizes well to unseen environments.

The core economic problem, the optimization of consumption and savings under idiosyncratic uncertainty, is formulated as a coupled system of partial differential equations: a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation for the agent's optimal policy and a Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) equation for the stationary wealth distribution. SIMPOL addresses this system using Howard's policy iteration with an *upwind* finite difference scheme that guarantees stability. A distinctive contribution is a novel consumption policy post-processing module that imposes regularity through smoothing and a projection onto an economically plausible slope band, improving convergence and model behavior. The robustness and accuracy of SIMPOL are validated through a set of integrated diagnostics, including verification of contraction in the Wasserstein-2 metric and comparison with the analytical solution of the Merton model in the no-volatility case. The framework is shown to be not only computationally efficient but also to produce solutions consistent with economic and mathematical theory, offering a reliable tool for research in quantitative macroeconomics.",

        "summary": "In game theory and multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), each agent selects a strategy, interacts with the environment and other agents, and subsequently updates its strategy based on the received payoff. This process generates a sequence of joint strategies $(s^t)_{t \\geq 0}$, where $s^t$ represents the strategy profile of all agents at time step $t$. A widely adopted principle in MARL algorithms is \"win-stay, lose-shift\", which dictates that an agent retains its current strategy if it achieves the best response. This principle exhibits a fixed-point property when the joint strategy has become an equilibrium. The sequence of joint strategies under this principle is referred to as a satisficing path, a concept first introduced in [40] and explored in the context of $N$-player games in [39]. A fundamental question arises regarding this principle: Under what conditions does every initial joint strategy $s$ admit a finite-length satisficing path $(s^t)_{0 \\leq t \\leq T}$ where $s^0=s$ and $s^T$ is an equilibrium? This paper establishes a sufficient condition for such a property, and demonstrates that any finite-state Markov game, as well as any $N$-player game, guarantees the existence of a finite-length satisficing path from an arbitrary initial strategy to some equilibrium. These results provide a stronger theoretical foundation for the design of MARL algorithms.",

We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\\geq NK\\log_2 K+N^2d^2\\log (1/\\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.",

Recent diffusion-based LLMs (dLLMs) enable parallel token generation through iterative denoising. However, current parallel decoding strategies rely on fixed, input-agnostic heuristics (e.g., confidence thresholds), which fail to adapt to input-specific characteristics, resulting in suboptimal speed-quality trade-offs across diverse NLP tasks. In this work, we explore a more flexible and dynamic approach to parallel decoding. We propose Learning to Parallel Decode (Learn2PD), a framework that trains a lightweight and adaptive filter model to predict, for each token position, whether the current prediction matches the final output. This learned filter approximates an oracle parallel decoding strategy that unmasks tokens only when correctly predicted. Importantly, the filter model is learned in a post-training manner, requiring only a small amount of computation to optimize it (minute-level GPU time). Additionally, we introduce End-of-Text Prediction (EoTP) to detect decoding completion at the end of sequence, avoiding redundant decoding of padding tokens. Experiments on the LLaDA benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves up to 22.58$\\times$ speedup without any performance drop, and up to 57.51$\\times$ when combined with KV-Cache.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) today are powerful problem solvers across many domains, and they continue to get stronger as they scale in model size, training set size, and training set quality, as shown by extensive research and experimentation across the industry. Training a frontier model today requires on the order of tens to hundreds of yottaflops, which is a massive investment of time, compute, and energy. Improving pretraining efficiency is therefore essential to enable the next generation of even more capable LLMs. While 8-bit floating point (FP8) training is now widely adopted, transitioning to even narrower precision, such as 4-bit floating point (FP4), could unlock additional improvements in computational speed and resource utilization. However, quantization at this level poses challenges to training stability, convergence, and implementation, notably for large-scale models trained on long token horizons. In this study, we introduce a novel approach for stable and accurate training of large language models (LLMs) using the NVFP4 format. Our method integrates Random Hadamard transforms (RHT) to bound block-level outliers, employs a two-dimensional quantization scheme for consistent representations across both the forward and backward passes, utilizes stochastic rounding for unbiased gradient estimation, and incorporates selective high-precision layers. We validate our approach by training a 12-billion-parameter model on 10 trillion tokens -- the longest publicly documented training run in 4-bit precision to date. Our results show that the model trained with our NVFP4-based pretraining technique achieves training loss and downstream task accuracies comparable to an FP8 baseline. These findings highlight that NVFP4, when combined with our training approach, represents a major step forward in narrow-precision LLM training algorithms.",

In many low-resource natural language generation (NLG) scenarios, practitioners may have only raw outputs, like highlights, recaps, or questions, or only raw inputs, such as articles, dialogues, or paragraphs, but seldom both. This mismatch forces small models to learn from very few examples or rely on costly, broad-scope synthetic examples produced by large LLMs. PbT addresses this by asking a teacher LLM to compress each unpaired example into a concise intermediate representation (IR), and training a student to reconstruct inputs from IRs. This enables outputs to be paired with student-generated inputs, yielding high-quality synthetic data. We evaluate PbT on five benchmarks-document summarization (XSum, CNNDM), dialogue summarization (SAMSum, DialogSum), and question generation (SQuAD)-as well as an unpaired setting on SwitchBoard (paired with DialogSum summaries). An 8B student trained only on PbT data outperforms models trained on 70 B teacher-generated corpora and other unsupervised baselines, coming within 1.2 ROUGE-L of human-annotated pairs and closing 82% of the oracle gap at one-third the annotation cost of direct synthesis. Human evaluation on SwitchBoard further confirms that only PbT produces concise, faithful summaries aligned with the target style, highlighting its advantage of generating in-domain sources that avoid the mismatch, limiting direct synthesis.",

By translating task prompts into each language, we uncover disparities in monolingual and cross-lingual performance and identify key trends based on model family, size, and prompting strategy. Our findings highlight persistent bias in LLM behavior and offer recommendations for improving equity in multilingual fact-checking. To investigate retrieval bias, we employed multilingual embedding models and look into the frequency of retrieved claims. Our analysis reveals that certain claims are retrieved disproportionately across different posts, leading to inflated retrieval performance for popular claims while under-representing less common ones.",

Moreover, since vulnerable user groups (e.g., people with disabilities) are one of the key target groups of this technology, it is crucial to ensure the safety and correctness of the output of LS systems. To address these issues, we propose an efficient framework for LS systems that utilizes small LLMs deployable in local environments. Within this framework, we explore knowledge distillation with synthesized data and in-context learning as baselines. Our experiments in five languages evaluate model outputs both automatically and manually. Our manual analysis reveals that while knowledge distillation boosts automatic metric scores, it also introduces a safety trade-off by increasing harmful simplifications. Importantly, we find that the model's output probability is a useful signal for detecting harmful simplifications. Leveraging this, we propose a filtering strategy that suppresses harmful simplifications while largely preserving beneficial ones. This work establishes a benchmark for efficient and safe LS with small LLMs. It highlights the key trade-offs between performance, efficiency, and safety, and demonstrates a promising approach for safe real-world deployment.",

Current approaches, however, rely heavily on prompt engineering over proprietary models, while open-source models struggle to face diverse-format, large-scale data files and long-horizon, multi-step reasoning that real-world analytics demands. This paper introduces DataMind, a scalable data synthesis and agent training recipe designed to build generalist data-analytic agents. DataMind tackles three key challenges in building open-source data-analytic agents, including insufficient data resources, improper training strategy, and unstable code-based multi-turn rollout. Concretely, DataMind applies 1) a fine-grained task taxonomy and a recursive easy-to-hard task composition mechanism to increase the diversity and difficulty of synthesized queries; 2) a knowledge-augmented trajectory sampling strategy followed by model-based and rule-based filtering; 3) a dynamically adjustable training objective combining both SFT and RL losses; 4) a memory-frugal and stable code-based multi-turn rollout framework. Built on DataMind, we curate DataMind-12K, a high-quality trajectory set spanning diverse domains, task categories, and data file formats for data-analytic tasks. Trained on DataMind-12K, our DataMind-14B achieves state-of-the-art with an average score of 71.16% on multiple data analysis benchmarks, outperforming the strongest proprietary baselines DeepSeek-V3.1 and GPT-5. Our DataMind-7B also performs best among all open-source models with a score of 68.10%. We also incorporate some empirical insights gained from our exploratory trials into the analysis experiments, aiming to provide actionable insights about agentic training for the community. We will release DataMind-12K and DataMind-7B,14B for the community's future research.",

Current interpretability methods, such as direct logit attribution (DLA) and sparse autoencoders (SAEs), provide restricted insight due to limitations such as the model's output vocabulary or unclear feature names. This work introduces Hyperdimensional Probe, a novel paradigm for decoding information from the LLM vector space. It combines ideas from symbolic representations and neural probing to project the model's residual stream into interpretable concepts via Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs). This probe combines the strengths of SAEs and conventional probes while overcoming their key limitations. We validate our decoding paradigm with controlled input-completion tasks, probing the model's final state before next-token prediction on inputs spanning syntactic pattern recognition, key-value associations, and abstract inference. We further assess it in a question-answering setting, examining the state of the model both before and after text generation. Our experiments show that our probe reliably extracts meaningful concepts across varied LLMs, embedding sizes, and input domains, also helping identify LLM failures. Our work advances information decoding in LLM vector space, enabling extracting more informative, interpretable, and structured features from neural representations.",

        "summary": "Fast generation of language texts is the holy grail that people pursue in the AI era. In this work, we introduced Discrete Diffusion Divergence Instruct (DiDi-Instruct), a training-based method that leads to fast language generation models by initializing from a pre-trained (masked) discrete diffusion language model (dLLM). The resulting DiDi-Instruct model outperforms the dLLM counterparts and the GPT-2 baseline with 64x acceleration. In the theoretical part of the paper, we build the foundation of DiDi-Instruct in a framework of integral KL-divergence minimization, with practical training algorithms. We also introduce techniques like grouped reward normalization, intermediate-state matching, and the reward-guided ancestral sampler (RGAS) that significantly improve the training stability, the model coverage, and the inference performances. On OpenWebText, DiDi-Instruct outperforms all accelerated language generation models as well as the GPT-2 baseline and the standard dLLMs, achieving sample perplexities ranging from 62.2 (8 NFEs) to 18.4 (128 NFEs). These performance gains are accomplished with a negligible entropy loss of about 1% and 20x less additional training wall-clock time. We further validate the robustness and effectiveness of DiDi-Instruct through extensive ablation studies, model scaling, and the generation of discrete protein sequences. In conclusion, DiDi-Instruct is an efficient yet effective distillation method, enabling language generation in the blink of an eye.

In this work we propose an alternative approach: Distilling the underlying computational mechanisms implemented by a teacher model.

We propose a method to match ``functionally correspondent'' circuit components and introduce a loss reflecting similarities between the representations that these induce. We evaluate circuit distillation on entity tracking and theory of mind (ToM) tasks using models from the Llama3 family. Our results demonstrate that circuit distillation outperforms standard distillation, successfully transferring algorithmic capabilities by adjusting only a small, targeted subset of student model parameters. This work establishes the feasibility of transferring mechanisms, which may in turn allow for efficient distillation of targeted teacher capabilities via interpretable and controllable internal student mechanisms.",

        "summary": "Generating accurate and calibrated confidence estimates is critical for deploying LLMs in high-stakes or user-facing applications, and remains an open challenge. Prior research has often framed confidence as a problem of eliciting a model's \"self-knowledge\", i.e., the ability of an LLM to judge whether its own answers are correct; this approach implicitly assumes that there is some privileged information about the answer's correctness that is accessible to the model itself. However, our experiments reveal that an LLM attempting to predict the correctness of its own outputs generally performs no better than an unrelated LLM. Moreover, we hypothesize that a key factor in building a \"Correctness Model\" (CM) is exposure to a target model's historical predictions. We propose multiple methods to inject this historical correctness information, creating a Generalized Correctness Model (GCM). We first show that GCMs can be trained on the correctness data from many LLMs and learn patterns for correctness prediction applicable across datasets and models. We then use CMs as a lens for studying the source of correctness prediction ability and its generalization, systematically controlling their training data and finding that answer phrasing is a strong predictor for correctness. We further explore alternative methods of injecting history without training an LLM, finding that including history as in-context examples can help improve correctness prediction, and post-hoc calibration can provide complementary reductions in calibration error. We evaluate GCMs based on Qwen3-8B across 5 model families and the MMLU and TriviaQA datasets, as well as on a downstream selective prediction task, finding that reliable LLM confidence estimation is a generalizable and model-agnostic skill learned by systematically encoding correctness history rather than a model-specific skill reliant on self-introspection.",

To address this gap, we propose a two-stage detection framework that integrates item-side semantics via large language models (LLMs). The first stage pre-screens suspicious users using low-cost behavioral criteria, and the second stage employs LLM-based auditing to evaluate semantic consistency. Furthermore, we enhance the auditing model through reinforcement fine-tuning on a lightweight LLM with carefully designed reward functions, yielding a specialized detector called SemanticShield. Experiments on six representative attack strategies demonstrate the effectiveness of SemanticShield against shilling attacks, and further evaluation on previously unseen attack methods shows its strong generalization capability.

        "summary": "The paradigm shift in large language models (LLMs) from instinctive responses to chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has fueled two prevailing assumptions: (1) reasoning capabilities only emerge in sufficiently large models, and (2) such capabilities require training on massive datasets. While the first assumption has already been challenged by recent sub-billion-parameter reasoning models such as Qwen3-0.6B and DeepSeek distilled variants, the second remains largely unquestioned. In this work, we revisit the necessity of scaling to extremely large corpora (>10T tokens) for reasoning emergence. By carefully curating and resampling open-source datasets that we identify as beneficial under our designed metrics, we demonstrate that strong reasoning abilities can emerge with far less data. Specifically, we show that only ~2T tokens of high-quality data are sufficient, and pre-training with 4.2T tokens on the dataset resampled from these ~2T tokens, followed by a established post-training procedure, enables the development of MobileLLM-R1, a series of sub-billion-parameter reasoning models that substantially outperform prior models trained on fully open-sourced data. For example, MobileLLM-R1-950M achieves an AIME score of 15.5, compared to just 0.6 for OLMo-2-1.48B and 0.3 for SmolLM-2-1.7B. Remarkably, despite being trained on only 11.7% of the tokens compared to Qwen3's proprietary 36T-token corpus for pretraining, MobileLLM-R1-950M matches or surpasses Qwen3-0.6B across multiple reasoning benchmarks. To facilitate further research in this direction, we have released the complete training recipe, data sources, data mixing ratio, and model checkpoints, together with the key insights obtained throughout this study.",

Crucially, high-fidelity imitation does not imply human-like unpredictability - human essays average a perplexity of 29.5, whereas matched LLM outputs average only 15.2. These findings demonstrate that stylistic fidelity and statistical detectability are separable, establishing a reproducible basis for future work in authorship modeling, detection, and identity-conditioned generation.",

We first identify effective token types, numbers, and insertion locations, then examine at what stage of training models begin to exploit the expanded computation space, and finally analyze dynamics within these spaces via attention maps. Experiments on models ranging from 1.7B to 32B across open-domain QA and math tasks show that appropriate token types and counts vary, but placing filler tokens directly before the final 'Answer:' token is most effective. Smaller models benefit most, up to 12.372 percentage points in SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct, indicating that these spaces act as additional computational capacity rather than redundant input. Attention maps reveal that expanded spaces often continue the original attention mechanism and sometimes focus on questions or answer options, suggesting meaningful computation for problem-solving.",

Large-scale analysis, however, has been constrained by the need for manual annotation due to the context-sensitive nature of metaphor. This study investigates the potential of large language models (LLMs) to automate metaphor identification in full texts. We compare three methods: (i) retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), where the model is provided with a codebook and instructed to annotate texts based on its rules and examples; (ii) prompt engineering, where we design task-specific verbal instructions; and (iii) fine-tuning, where the model is trained on hand-coded texts to optimize performance. Within prompt engineering, we test zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought strategies. Our results show that state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs can achieve high accuracy, with fine-tuning yielding a median F1 score of 0.79. A comparison of human and LLM outputs reveals that most discrepancies are systematic, reflecting well-known grey areas and conceptual challenges in metaphor theory. We propose that LLMs can be used to at least partly automate metaphor identification and can serve as a testbed for developing and refining metaphor identification protocols and the theory that underpins them.",

Increasingly, these chatbots are being used in high-stakes contexts, including emotional support and mental health concerns. While LLMs can offer scalable support, their ability to safely detect and respond to acute mental health crises remains poorly understood. Progress is hampered by the absence of unified crisis taxonomies, robust annotated benchmarks, and empirical evaluations grounded in clinical best practices. In this work, we address these gaps by introducing a unified taxonomy of six clinically-informed mental health crisis categories, curating a diverse evaluation dataset, and establishing an expert-designed protocol for assessing response appropriateness. We systematically benchmark three state-of-the-art LLMs for their ability to classify crisis types and generate safe, appropriate responses. The results reveal that while LLMs are highly consistent and generally reliable in addressing explicit crisis disclosures, significant risks remain. A non-negligible proportion of responses are rated as inappropriate or harmful, with responses generated by an open-weight model exhibiting higher failure rates than those generated by the commercial ones. We also identify systemic weaknesses in handling indirect or ambiguous risk signals, a reliance on formulaic and inauthentic default replies, and frequent misalignment with user context. These findings underscore the urgent need for enhanced safeguards, improved crisis detection, and context-aware interventions in LLM deployments. Our taxonomy, datasets, and evaluation framework lay the groundwork for ongoing research and responsible innovation in AI-driven mental health support, helping to minimize harm and better protect vulnerable users.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models face significant performance challenges in specialized domains, with state-of-the-art models achieving only 45.9% accuracy on medical coding tasks. This study proposes a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework that addresses domain-specific AI limitations through systematic error analysis and targeted intervention strategies. We analyze error patterns across four specialized domains and find that AI errors follow consistent hierarchical structures: Knowledge-layer errors (58.4%), Reasoning-layer errors (39.6%), and Complexity-layer errors (2.0%). Based on these patterns, we develop a three-stage correction framework that addresses errors according to their hierarchical importance and demonstrates that framework effectiveness correlates inversely with baseline task performance. Experimental validation across medical transcription (4,921 cases), legal document classification (1,000 cases), political bias detection (645 cases), and legal reasoning (1,000 cases) shows consistent improvements. Cross-model validation across five LLM architectures demonstrates average improvements of 11.2 percentage points (p < 0.001). However, analysis reveals framework limitations in high-baseline tasks (>75% accuracy), where hierarchical intervention may interfere with effective reasoning processes. The results suggest that systematic error analysis can guide effective AI enhancement strategies in specialized domains, particularly for moderate-baseline tasks, while highlighting the importance of understanding framework boundaries for optimal deployment.",

Existing approaches primarily focus on compressing KV caches within a single prompt or reusing shared prefixes or frequently ocurred text segments across prompts. However, such strategies are limited in scenarios where prompts are semantically similar but lexically different, which frequently occurs in tasks such as multi-document summarization and conversational agents. We propose \\textit{SemShareKV}, a KV cache sharing and compression framework that accelerates LLM inference by reusing KVCache in semantically similar prompts. Instead of relying on exact token matches, SemShareKV applies fuzzy token matching using locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) on token embeddings and incorporates Rotary Position Embedding (RoPE) to better preserve positional information. By selectively reusing relevant key-value pairs from a reference prompt's cache, SemShareKV reduces redundant computation while maintaining output quality. Experiments on diverse summarization datasets show up to 6.25$\\times$ speedup and 42\\% lower GPU memory usage with 5k tokens input, with negligible quality degradation. These results highlight the potential of semantic-aware cache sharing for efficient LLM inference.",

Traditional CD models lack a suitable framework for handling dynamic, unstructured dialogues, and it's difficult to accurately extract diagnostic semantics from lengthy dialogues. To overcome these hurdles, we propose DiaCDM, an innovative model. We've adapted the initiation-response-evaluation (IRE) framework from educational theory to design a diagnostic framework tailored for dialogue. We also developed a unique graph-based encoding method that integrates teacher questions with relevant knowledge components to capture key information more precisely. To our knowledge, this is the first exploration of cognitive diagnosis in a dialogue setting. Experiments on three real-world dialogue datasets confirm that DiaCDM not only significantly improves diagnostic accuracy but also enhances the results' interpretability, providing teachers with a powerful tool for assessing students' cognitive states.

        "summary": "In clinical practice, physicians refrain from making decisions when patient information is insufficient. This behavior, known as abstention, is a critical safety mechanism preventing potentially harmful misdiagnoses. Recent investigations have reported the application of large language models (LLMs) in medical scenarios. However, existing LLMs struggle with the abstentions, frequently providing overconfident responses despite incomplete information. This limitation stems from conventional abstention methods relying solely on model self-assessments, which lack systematic strategies to identify knowledge boundaries with external medical evidences. To address this, we propose \\textbf{KnowGuard}, a novel \\textit{investigate-before-abstain} paradigm that integrates systematic knowledge graph exploration for clinical decision-making. Our approach consists of two key stages operating on a shared contextualized evidence pool: 1) an evidence discovery stage that systematically explores the medical knowledge space through graph expansion and direct retrieval, and 2) an evidence evaluation stage that ranks evidence using multiple factors to adapt exploration based on patient context and conversation history. This two-stage approach enables systematic knowledge graph exploration, allowing models to trace structured reasoning paths and recognize insufficient medical evidence. We evaluate our abstention approach using open-ended multi-round clinical benchmarks that mimic realistic diagnostic scenarios, assessing abstention quality through accuracy-efficiency trade-offs beyond existing closed-form evaluations. Experimental evidences clearly demonstrate that KnowGuard outperforms state-of-the-art abstention approaches, improving diagnostic accuracy by 3.93\\% while reducing unnecessary interaction by 7.27 turns on average.",

However, due to the limited capacity of models in scoring or generating responses, the quality of positive and negative samples may become similar during training, which complicates optimization for preference learning. To address this issue, we introduce SeaPO, a Strategic Error Amplification method that leverages three error types commonly occurring in LLMs to introduce specific error patterns into the model Preference Optimization. This strategy ensures that negative samples are more erroneous than positive samples and preference-based training is employed to mitigate the occurrence of these errors, thereby enhancing model performance. Evaluations across five capability dimensions and different model scales (1.5B to 14B) demonstrate that the generated data significantly improved overall model performance, particularly in terms of truthfulness, with improvements of 5-10 percentage points observed. Further analysis reveals that task performance varies depending on the error types introduced. Injecting the most common error types improves performance in related tasks, while a mix of error types leads to a broader performance enhancement: most tasks show stable improvements, while a few tasks exhibit significant gains.",

However, existing TTS methods are largely independent, implying that LLMs have not yet evolved to progressively learn how to scale more effectively. With the objective of evolving LLMs to learn ``how to scale test-time computation,'' we propose LatentEvolve, a self-evolving latent TTS framework inspired by the complementary learning system (CLS) theory. Analogous to the human brain's dual system of a fast-recall hippocampus and a slow-consolidating neocortex, LatentEvolve comprises two evolutionary components: \\textit{daytime scaling}, which rapidly retrieves historical latent representations to better guide current LLM reasoning; and \\textit{nighttime scaling}, which integrates past latent optimizations in a manner akin to the human brain's consolidation of experiences during sleep. The alternation of daytime and nighttime processes facilitates a fast and slow evolution of LLM TTS, mirroring human cognitive dynamics in a fully unsupervised manner. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks and five model backbones demonstrate that our LatentEvolve surpasses state-of-the-art TTS methods such as LatentSeek and TTRL by up to $13.33\\%$ and exhibits exceptional cross-domain and cross-backbone generalization.",

Recently, methods that dynamically estimate block importance have enabled efficient block sparse attention, leading to significant acceleration in long-text pre-filling of LLMs. However, their coarse-grained estimation inevitably leads to performance degradation at high sparsity rates. In this work, we propose ProxyAttn, a training-free sparse attention algorithm that achieves more precise block estimation by compressing the dimension of attention heads. Based on our observation of the similarity among multiple attention heads, we use the scores of pooled representative heads to approximate the scores for all heads. To account for the varying sparsity among heads, we also propose a block-aware dynamic budget estimation method. By combining the scores from representative proxy heads with multi-head dynamic budgets, we achieve a more fine-grained block importance evaluation at low computational cost. Experiments on a variety of mainstream models and extensive benchmarks confirm the underlying similarity among attention heads. Leveraging a fine-grained estimation, the proposed method achieves substantial gains in performance and efficiency compared to existing methods. More precisely, ProxyAttn can achieve up to 10.3x attention acceleration and 2.4x prefilling acceleration without significant performance loss.

While data synthesis or distillation offers a promising alternative, existing methods struggle with inconsistent data quality and an inability to dynamically adapt to the evolving capabilities of the model, leading to suboptimal training signals. To address these limitations, we introduce Socratic-Zero, a fully autonomous framework that generates high-quality training data from minimal seed examples through the co-evolution of three agents: the Teacher, the Solver, and the Generator. The Solver continuously refines its reasoning by learning from preference feedback on both successful and failed trajectories; the Teacher adaptively crafts increasingly challenging questions based on the Solver's weaknesses; and the Generator distills the Teacher's question-design strategy to enable scalable, high-fidelity curriculum generation. This closed-loop system produces a self-improving curriculum-requiring no pre-existing tasks or labels. Remarkably, starting from only 100 seed questions, our Socratic-Solver-8B achieves an average gain of +20.2 percentage points over prior data synthesis methods across seven mathematical reasoning benchmarks (AMC23, AIME24-25, Olympiad, MATH-500, Minerva, and GSM8K), with consistent gains on both Qwen3 and GLM4 series models. Even more surprisingly, synthetic data from Socratic-Generator-32B enables student LLMs to achieve superior performance compared to other state-of-the-art (SOTA) commercial LLMs on these benchmarks, including Qwen3-235B-A22B, DeepSeek-V3.1-671B, GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Grok-4, and Claude-4.1-Opus.",

To address this gap, we propose MemGen, a dynamic generative memory framework that equips agents with a human-esque cognitive faculty. It consists of a \\textit{memory trigger}, which monitors the agent's reasoning state to decide explicit memory invocation, and a \\textit{memory weaver}, which takes the agent's current state as stimulus to construct a latent token sequence as machine-native memory to enrich its reasoning. In this way, MemGen enables agents to recall and augment latent memory throughout reasoning, producing a tightly interwoven cycle of memory and cognition. Extensive experiments across eight benchmarks show that MemGen surpasses leading external memory systems such as ExpeL and AWM by up to $38.22\\%$, exceeds GRPO by up to $13.44\\%$, and exhibits strong cross-domain generalization ability. More importantly, we find that without explicit supervision, MemGen spontaneously evolves distinct human-like memory faculties, including planning memory, procedural memory, and working memory, suggesting an emergent trajectory toward more naturalistic forms of machine cognition.",

We then propose and evaluate Latent Judges, which derive scalar ratings from internal model signals: (i) probability-weighted scores over integer ratings, (ii) verifier-style probabilities of \"yes\", and (iii) linear probes trained on model activations at the rating position. Across a broad suite of pairwise and single-rating benchmarks, latent methods match or surpass standard prompting, with consistent gains on pairwise accuracy and listwise ranking relevant to Best-of-N selection. Probability-weighted scores achieve the strongest single-rating correlations, while probes recover useful signals when output logits are miscalibrated.

On one side, \"forgotten\" knowledge can often be recovered through interventions such as light fine-tuning; on the other side, unlearning may induce catastrophic forgetting that degrades general capabilities. Despite active exploration of unlearning methods, interpretability analyses of the mechanism are scarce due to the difficulty of tracing knowledge in LLMs' complex architectures. We address this gap by proposing unPact, an interpretable framework for unlearning via prompt attribution and contribution tracking. Typically, it quantifies each prompt token's influence on outputs, enabling pre- and post-unlearning comparisons to reveal what changes. Across six mainstream unlearning methods, three LLMs, and three benchmarks, we find that: (1) Unlearning appears to be effective by disrupting focus on keywords in prompt; (2) Much of the knowledge is not truly erased and can be recovered by simply emphasizing these keywords in prompts, without modifying the model's weights; (3) Catastrophic forgetting arises from indiscriminate penalization of all tokens. Taken together, our results suggest an unlearning dilemma: existing methods tend either to be insufficient - knowledge remains recoverable by keyword emphasis, or overly destructive - general performance collapses due to catastrophic forgetting, still leaving a gap to reliable unlearning.",

While trainable sparse attention methods offer a promising solution, existing approaches such as NSA introduce excessive extra parameters and disrupt the conventional \\textit{pretrain-on-short, finetune-on-long} workflow, resulting in slow convergence and difficulty in acceleration. To overcome these limitations, we introduce dense-sparse switchable attention framework, termed as InfLLM-V2. InfLLM-V2 is a trainable sparse attention that seamlessly adapts models from short to long sequences. Specifically, InfLLM-V2 reuses dense attention parameters through parameter-free architecture modification, maintaining consistency between short and long sequence processing. Additionally, InfLLM-V2 ensures computational efficiency across all sequence lengths, by using dense attention for short inputs and smoothly transitioning to sparse attention for long sequences. To achieve practical acceleration, we further introduce an efficient implementation of InfLLM-V2 that significantly reduces the computational overhead. Our experiments on long-context understanding and chain-of-thought reasoning demonstrate that InfLLM-V2 is 4$\\times$ faster than dense attention while retaining 98.1% and 99.7% of the performance, respectively.

The proposed framework not only consists of high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word, phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data. HiKE will be available at https://github.com/ThetaOne-AI/HiKE.",

        "summary": "Dyslexia, a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by persistent reading difficulties, is often linked to reduced activity of the visual word form area in the ventral occipito-temporal cortex. Traditional approaches to studying dyslexia, such as behavioral and neuroimaging methods, have provided valuable insights but remain limited in their ability to test causal hypotheses about the underlying mechanisms of reading impairments. In this study, we use large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) to simulate dyslexia by functionally identifying and perturbing artificial analogues of word processing. Using stimuli from cognitive neuroscience, we identify visual-word-form-selective units within VLMs and demonstrate that targeted ablation of these units, unlike ablation of random units, leads to selective impairments in reading tasks while general visual and language comprehension abilities remain intact. In particular, the resulting model matches dyslexic humans' phonological deficits without a significant change in orthographic processing. Taken together, our modeling results replicate key characteristics of dyslexia and establish a computational framework for investigating reading disorders.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in inference time scaling with extended long chain-of thought have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of both general and medical large language models (LLMs). However, these models tend to engage in lengthy reasoning processes regardless of the difficulty of the input question, leading to increased inference costs in real-world applications. Therefore, enabling adaptive thinking where models think less for simpler questions and think more for complex ones is critical for the effective use of medical LLMs in practice. Despite its importance, there is a lack of end-to-end approaches designed to enhance the adaptive thinking capabilities of medical LLMs while providing a comprehensive examination of the trade-off between performance and computational cost. To bridge this gap, we propose AdaThink-Med, the first end-to-end framework designed to enhance adaptive thinking ability in medical reasoning models with uncertainty-guided length calibration. AdaThink-Med first generates multiple candidate outputs for each question, evaluates the correctness and uncertainty of each candidate, and then estimates problem difficulty via an uncertainty-guided length calibration module. For outputs with low difficulty and correct answers, the framework penalizes longer reasoning paths; whereas for those with high difficulty and incorrect answers, it encourages extending the chain of thought to explore alternative solutions. On six public medical QA benchmarks, AdaThink-Med achieves up to 6.4x length reduction on average while retaining performance with only minimal degradation. Intriguingly, we observe that AdaThink-Med spontaneously develops two distinct reasoning modes, which we characterize as \"non-thinking\" and \"thinking\", demonstrating the model's ability to suppress redundant reasoning processes dynamically.",

To address this, we propose Subspace Knowledge Edit (SUIT), a method that identifies and modifies only the subspace of critical features relevant to the edit. Our empirical results on LLaMA-3-8B, GPT-J-6B, and Qwen2.5-7B models show that SUIT dramatically improves knowledge preservation over strong baselines while maintaining high edit efficacy.

To mitigate these challenges, we propose GRPO-MA, a simple yet theoretically grounded method that leverages multi-answer generation from each thought process, enabling more robust and efficient optimization. Theoretically, we show that the variance of thought advantage decreases as the number of answers per thought increases. Empirically, our gradient analysis confirms this effect, showing that GRPO-MA reduces gradient spikes compared to GRPO.

        "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve remarkable success across a wide range of applications, such as chatbots and code copilots, concerns surrounding the generation of harmful content have come increasingly into focus. Despite significant advances in aligning LLMs with safety and ethical standards, adversarial prompts can still be crafted to elicit undesirable responses. Existing mitigation strategies are predominantly based on post-hoc filtering, which introduces substantial latency or computational overhead, and is incompatible with token-level streaming generation. In this work, we introduce Self-Sanitize, a novel LLM-driven mitigation framework inspired by cognitive psychology, which emulates human self-monitor and self-repair behaviors during conversations. Self-Sanitize comprises a lightweight Self-Monitor module that continuously inspects high-level intentions within the LLM at the token level via representation engineering, and a Self-Repair module that performs in-place correction of harmful content without initiating separate review dialogues. This design allows for real-time streaming monitoring and seamless repair, with negligible impact on latency and resource utilization. Given that privacy-invasive content has often been insufficiently focused in previous studies, we perform extensive experiments on four LLMs across three privacy leakage scenarios. The results demonstrate that Self-Sanitize achieves superior mitigation performance with minimal overhead and without degrading the utility of LLMs, offering a practical and robust solution for safer LLM deployments.

This highlights the need for finer-grained error analysis, which depends on accurate alignment between reference and model transcripts. However, conventional alignment methods are not designed for such precision. We propose a novel alignment algorithm that couples dynamic programming with beam search scoring.

In contrast, cultural commonsense is closely related to social biases, as both are rooted in social norms and values. The impact of bias mitigation on cultural commonsense in LLMs has not been well investigated. Considering this gap, we propose SOBACO (SOcial BiAs and Cultural cOmmonsense benchmark), a Japanese benchmark designed to evaluate social biases and cultural commonsense in LLMs in a unified format. We evaluate several LLMs on SOBACO to examine how debiasing methods affect cultural commonsense in LLMs. Our results reveal that the debiasing methods degrade the performance of the LLMs on the cultural commonsense task (up to 75% accuracy deterioration). These results highlight the importance of developing debiasing methods that consider the trade-off with cultural commonsense to improve fairness and utility of LLMs.",

In this paper, we formally define the problem and identify three key challenges: (1) inefficient training due to excessive reasoning steps, (2) disregard of the imbalanced token entropy distribution, and (3) underutilization of token information. To address these challenges, we propose RMT, a framework for efficient, adaptive, and unified reinforcement mid-training with various innovative components. In particular, we first introduce a dynamic token budget mechanism that constrains unnecessary reasoning steps and mitigates model overthinking. Next, we design a curriculum-based adaptive sampling method that fosters a progressive learning trajectory from easy to hard tokens. Finally, we present a dual training strategy that combines reinforcement learning with next-token prediction, ensuring targeted learning on key tokens and full exploitation of all token information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of RMT over state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to +64.91% performance improvement with only 21% of the reasoning length in language modeling. We also show that checkpoints obtained after reinforcement mid-training can benefit the subsequent post-training, yielding up to +18.76% improvement in the mathematical domain.",

We address this by studying curriculum learning in pretraining, focusing on text-complexity ordering and data augmentation via simplification. We ask: (1) Does simplifying texts enhance representation quality more than reusing the original data? and (2) Does ordering data by text complexity yield better representations? To answer, we build on a pair of parallel corpora where human-written paragraphs are aligned with LLM-simplified variants, and test four data schedules: repeated exposure, low-to-high complexity, high-to-low, and interleaved. We analyze models' representation quality from a sample efficiency perspective via fine-tuning, as well as its zero-shot performance on linguistic knowledge, entity tracking, world knowledge, and commonsense reasoning. Our findings show that adding simplified data improves fine-tuning and zero-shot performance over a repeated-exposure baseline: smaller models benefit from low-to-high complexity, while larger models perform better with interleaved ordering.",

However, their performance and cross-lingual alignment often lag for non-dominant languages. A common solution is to fine-tune LLMs on large-scale and more balanced multilingual corpus, but such approaches often lead to imprecise alignment and suboptimal knowledge transfer, struggling with limited improvements across languages. In this paper, we propose AlignX to bridge the multilingual performance gap, which is a two-stage representation-level framework for enhancing multilingual performance of pre-trained LLMs. In the first stage, we align multilingual representations with multilingual semantic alignment and language feature integration. In the second stage, we stimulate the multilingual capability of LLMs via multilingual instruction fine-tuning. Experimental results on several pre-trained LLMs demonstrate that our approach enhances LLMs' multilingual general and cross-lingual generation capability. Further analysis indicates that AlignX brings the multilingual representations closer and improves the cross-lingual alignment.",

        "summary": "LLMs have low GPU efficiency and high latency due to autoregressive decoding. Speculative decoding (SD) mitigates this using a small draft model to speculatively generate multiple tokens, which are then verified in parallel by a target model. However, when speculation accuracy is low, the overhead from rejected tokens can offset the benefits, limiting SD's effectiveness, especially at large batch sizes. To address this, we propose Speculative Verification (SV), an efficient augmentation to SD that dynamically predicts speculation accuracy and adapts the verification length to maximize throughput. SV introduces a companion model - a small auxiliary model similar in size to the draft model - to estimate the alignment between draft and target model distributions. By maximizing the information gain from quantifying this alignment, SV refines verification decisions, reducing wasted computation on rejected tokens and improving decoding efficiency. Moreover, SV requires no modifications to the draft or target models and is compatible with existing SD variants. We extensively evaluated SV on publicly available LLMs across three NLP tasks using nine combinations of draft, companion, and target models, including 13B-72B target models and three types of variations: base (no finetuning), instruction-tuned, and task fine-tuned. Across all experiments and batch sizes (4-80), SV consistently outperforms both SD and standard decoding with the target model. It improves SD performance by up to 2$\\times$, with an average speedup of 1.4 $\\times$ in large-batch settings (batch sizes 32-80). These results demonstrate SV's robustness, scalability, and practical utility for efficient LLM inference.",

        "summary": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have driven major advances in language understanding, marking a significant step toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). With increasing demands for higher-level semantics and cross-modal fusion, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged, integrating diverse information sources (e.g., text, vision, and audio) to enhance modeling and reasoning in complex scenarios. In AI for Science, multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning has become a rapidly growing frontier. While LLMs and MLLMs have achieved notable progress in this area, the field still lacks a systematic review that consolidates recent developments. To address this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of LLMs and MLLMs for emotion recognition and reasoning, covering model architectures, datasets, and performance benchmarks. We further highlight key challenges and outline future research directions, aiming to offer researchers both an authoritative reference and practical insights for advancing this domain. To the best of our knowledge, this paper is the first attempt to comprehensively survey the intersection of MLLMs with multimodal emotion recognition and reasoning.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) can express different values in two distinct ways: (1) intrinsic expression, reflecting the model's inherent values learned during training, and (2) prompted expression, elicited by explicit prompts. Given their widespread use in value alignment and persona steering, it is paramount to clearly understand their underlying mechanisms, particularly whether they mostly overlap (as one might expect) or rely on substantially different mechanisms, but this remains largely understudied. We analyze this at the mechanistic level using two approaches: (1) value vectors, feature directions representing value mechanisms extracted from the residual stream, and (2) value neurons, MLP neurons that contribute to value expressions. We demonstrate that intrinsic and prompted value mechanisms partly share common components that are crucial for inducing value expression, but also possess unique elements that manifest in different ways. As a result, these mechanisms lead to different degrees of value steerability (prompted > intrinsic) and response diversity (intrinsic > prompted). In particular, components unique to the intrinsic mechanism seem to promote lexical diversity in responses, whereas those specific to the prompted mechanism primarily strengthen instruction following, taking effect even in distant tasks like jailbreaking.",

We further demonstrate that top-tier understanding models align closely with human judgment in MMQA quality assessment.

In this paper, we conduct an in-depth analysis of dLLM vulnerabilities to jailbreak attacks across two distinct dimensions: intra-step and inter-step dynamics. Experimental results reveal a harmful bias inherent in the standard greedy remasking strategy and identify a critical phenomenon we term Denoising-path Dependence, where the safety of early-stage tokens decisively influences the final output. These findings also indicate that while current decoding strategies constitute a significant vulnerability, dLLMs possess a substantial intrinsic safety potential. To unlock this potential, we propose DiffuGuard, a training-free defense framework that addresses vulnerabilities through a dual-stage approach: Stochastic Annealing Remasking dynamically introduces controlled randomness to mitigate greedy selection bias, while Block-level Audit and Repair exploits internal model representations for autonomous risk detection and guided correction. Comprehensive experiments on four dLLMs demonstrate DiffuGuard's exceptional effectiveness, reducing Attack Success Rate against six diverse jailbreak methods from 47.9% to 14.7% while preserving model utility and efficiency.

By producing sequences of soft tokens optimized under contrastive objective, GIRCSE captures latent concepts and implicit semantics that encoder-only methods often miss.

To address this, we introduce $\\textbf{SimuHome}$, a time-accelerated home environment that simulates smart devices, supports API calls, and reflects changes in environmental variables.

In this paper, we introduce BeyondBench, an evaluation framework that avoids this problem by using algorithmic problem generation. Unlike traditional benchmarks that risk contamination from internet-scale training data, BeyondBench creates mathematically grounded problems on the fly, ensuring each test remains fresh and uncontaminated. Our framework covers 44 algorithmic tasks with a total of 117 variations, grouped into three difficulty levels: the Easy Suite (29 tasks) for basic arithmetic and statistics, the Medium Suite (5 tasks, 49 variations) for sequence patterns and reasoning, and the Hard Suite (10 tasks, 68 variations) tackling NP-complete and constraint satisfaction problems. Each task generates problems from a combinatorial space larger than 10^15 unique instances, with solutions verified deterministically by mathematical proofs. We evaluated 101 language models, including 85 open-source and 16 closed-source models, spanning sizes from 0.5B to 141B parameters and multiple quantization schemes. Our results show consistent reasoning deficiencies across model families, with performance degrading sharply as problem complexity increases from polynomial to exponential. In our Hard Suite evaluations, models such as Gemini-2.5-pro, Llama-3.3-70B, and Qwen2.5-72B achieved average accuracies of 56.38%, 26.91%, and 33.60%, respectively. Moreover, we observe that performance drops drastically without tool usage, with GPT-5, GPT-5-mini, and GPT-5-nano showing a decline of 16.81%, 28.05%, and 47.59% accuracy on the hard suite.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in high-stakes settings, where overconfident responses can mislead users. Reliable confidence estimation has been shown to enhance trust and task accuracy. Yet existing methods face practical barriers: logits are often hidden, multi-sampling is computationally expensive, and verbalized numerical uncertainty (e.g., giving a 0-100 score) deviates from natural communication. We revisit linguistic confidence (LC), where models express uncertainty through hedging language (e.g., probably, might), offering a lightweight and human-centered alternative. To advance this direction, we (1) release the first diverse, large-scale dataset of hedging expressions with human-annotated confidence scores, and (2) propose a lightweight mapper that converts hedges into confidence scores at near-zero cost. Building on these resources, we (3) conduct the first systematic study of LC across modern LLMs and QA benchmarks, revealing that while most LLMs underperform in expressing reliable LC, carefully designed prompting achieves competitive calibration and discriminability. Finally, we (4) introduce a fine-tuning framework that further improves LC reliability. Taken together, our work positions linguistic confidence as a scalable, efficient, and human-aligned approach to LLM uncertainty estimation, and calls for deeper exploration of this promising yet underexplored direction.",

We propose AceSearcher, a cooperative self-play framework that trains a single large language model (LLM) to alternate between two roles: a decomposer that breaks down complex queries and a solver that integrates retrieved contexts for answer generation. AceSearcher couples supervised fine-tuning on a diverse mixture of search, reasoning, and decomposition tasks with reinforcement fine-tuning optimized for final answer accuracy, eliminating the need for intermediate annotations. Extensive experiments on three reasoning-intensive tasks across 10 datasets show that AceSearcher outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average exact match improvement of 7.6%. Remarkably, on document-level finance reasoning tasks, AceSearcher-32B matches the performance of the DeepSeek-V3 model using less than 5% of its parameters. Even at smaller scales (1.5B and 8B), AceSearcher often surpasses existing search-augmented LLMs with up to 9x more parameters, highlighting its exceptional efficiency and effectiveness in tackling complex reasoning tasks.

        "summary": "Understanding how user preference evolves over time is a fundamental challenge central to modern digital ecosystems, for which Large Language Models (LLMs) are an increasingly prominent and popular approach due to their ability to comprehend the rich semantic context within behavioral data. A common practice is to use LLMs to predict a user's next action by directly generating a ranked list of preferred items. Although effective for short-term prediction, the end-to-end generation paradigm inherently limits personalization. Its opaque decision-making process obscures holistic user profiling and exacerbates popularity bias. To address these limitations, we propose Preference Evolution Tracking (PET), a framework that reframes the task as inferring a dynamic probability distribution over a stable and interpretable lattice of preference clusters. By applying logit-probing and generative classification techniques, PET infers a user's preference as a probability distribution, enabling transparent preference learning. On public benchmarks (Yelp, MovieLens), PET improves ranking quality by up to 40% in NDCG over direct generation baselines. On a large-scale, real-world dataset from a short-video platform, it excels at ranking long-tail contents, significantly outperforming a SOTA production model by 7 times in the NDCG score. Ultimately, PET transforms the user profile model from direct preference list generation to a transparent distributional preference mapping, paving the way for more explainable, fair, and diverse personalization systems.",

        "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly proposed for high-stakes medical applications, there has emerged a critical need for reliable and accurate evaluation methodologies. Traditional accuracy metrics fail inadequately as they neither capture question characteristics nor offer topic-specific insights. To address this gap, we introduce \\textsc{MedIRT}, a rigorous evaluation framework grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT), the gold standard in high-stakes educational testing. Unlike previous research relying on archival data, we prospectively gathered fresh responses from 80 diverse LLMs on a balanced, 1,100-question USMLE-aligned benchmark. Using one unidimensional two-parameter logistic IRT model per topic, we estimate LLM's latent model ability jointly with question difficulty and discrimination, yielding more stable and nuanced performance rankings than accuracy alone. Notably, we identify distinctive ``spiky'' ability profiles, where overall rankings can be misleading due to highly specialized model abilities. While \\texttt{GPT-5} was the top performer in a majority of domains (8 of 11), it was outperformed in Social Science and Communication by \\texttt{Claude-3-opus}, demonstrating that even an overall 23rd-ranked model can hold the top spot for specific competencies. Furthermore, we demonstrate IRT's utility in auditing benchmarks by identifying flawed questions. We synthesize these findings into a practical decision-support framework that integrates our multi-factor competency profiles with operational metrics. This work establishes a robust, psychometrically grounded methodology essential for the safe, effective, and trustworthy deployment of LLMs in healthcare.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform new tasks from in-context demonstrations, a phenomenon known as in-context learning (ICL). Recent work suggests that these demonstrations are compressed into task vectors (TVs), compact task representations that LLMs exploit for predictions. However, prior studies typically extract TVs from model outputs or hidden states using cumbersome and opaque methods, and they rarely elucidate the mechanisms by which TVs influence computation. In this work, we address both limitations. First, we propose directly training Learned Task Vectors (LTVs), which surpass extracted TVs in accuracy and exhibit superior flexibility-acting effectively at arbitrary layers, positions, and even with ICL prompts. Second, through systematic analysis, we investigate the mechanistic role of TVs, showing that at the low level they steer predictions primarily through attention-head OV circuits, with a small subset of \"key heads\" most decisive. At a higher level, we find that despite Transformer nonlinearities, TV propagation is largely linear: early TVs are rotated toward task-relevant subspaces to improve logits of relevant labels, while later TVs are predominantly scaled in magnitude. Taken together, LTVs not only provide a practical approach for obtaining effective TVs but also offer a principled lens into the mechanistic foundations of ICL.",

We propose a novel framework based on Task Subspace Logit Attribution (TSLA) to identify attention heads specialized in TR and TL, and demonstrate their distinct yet complementary roles. Through correlation analysis, ablation studies, and input perturbations, we show that the identified TR and TL heads independently and effectively capture the TR and TL components of ICL. Using steering experiments with geometric analysis of hidden states, we reveal that TR heads promote task recognition by aligning hidden states with the task subspace, while TL heads rotate hidden states within the subspace toward the correct label to facilitate prediction. We further show how previous findings on ICL mechanisms, including induction heads and task vectors, can be reconciled with our attention-head-level analysis of the TR-TL decomposition. Our framework thus provides a unified and interpretable account of how large language models execute ICL across diverse tasks and settings.",

Whether different LRMs reason differently remains an open question. To address this gap, we introduce the LLM-proposed Open Taxonomy (LOT), a classification method that uses a generative language model to compare reasoning traces from two LRMs and articulate their distinctive features in words. LOT then models how these features predict the source LRM of a reasoning trace based on their empirical distributions across LRM outputs. Iterating this process over a dataset of reasoning traces yields a human-readable taxonomy that characterizes how models think. We apply LOT to compare the reasoning of 12 open-source LRMs on tasks in math, science, and coding. LOT identifies systematic differences in their thoughts, achieving 80-100% accuracy in distinguishing reasoning traces from LRMs that differ in scale, base model family, or objective domain. Beyond classification, LOT's natural-language taxonomy provides qualitative explanations of how LRMs think differently. Finally, in a case study, we link the reasoning differences to performance: aligning the reasoning style of smaller Qwen3 models with that of the largest Qwen3 during test time improves their accuracy on GPQA by 3.3-5.7%.",

        "summary": "The performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) hinges on carefully engineered prompts. However, prevailing prompt optimization methods, ranging from heuristic edits and reinforcement learning to evolutionary search, primarily target point-wise accuracy. They seldom enforce paraphrase invariance or searching stability, and therefore cannot remedy this brittleness in practice. Automated prompt search remains brittle: small, semantically preserving paraphrases often cause large performance swings. We identify this brittleness as the textual sharpness of the prompt landscape. In this work, we provide the first formal treatment of textual sharpness in the discrete, semantic space of prompts, together with an operational robustness criterion over a semantic neighborhood; the design is black-box or API-only, requiring no gradients to update the model's parameters. Then we introduce TARE (Textual Sharpness-Aware Evolving), a derivative-free framework that alternates between an inner, sampling-based adversarial search that stresses a prompt with hard paraphrases and an outer, robust selection that prefers candidates whose neighborhoods remain strong. We further propose ATARE, which learns anisotropic weights to shape the semantic neighborhood and adapts its radius over time to balance exploration and fidelity. Diverse tasks evaluate our methods, whose design for minimizing textual sharpness gap leads to prompts that preserve accuracy under paraphrasing, outperforming accuracy-only prompt search while remaining computationally practical.",

A central question remains: can these models discover new knowledge, and how can we evaluate this ability? We address this by studying abductive reasoning-the generation of plausible hypotheses to explain observations-and introduce GEAR (General Evaluation for Abductive Reasoning), a general-purpose, fully automated, transparent, and label-free evaluation paradigm. GEAR scores hypothesis sets by three metrics: consistency (each hypothesis explains the observations), generalizability (consistent hypotheses make meaningful predictions on unseen inputs), and diversity (the set covers distinct predictions and patterns). Built this way, GEAR is scalable (no human gold answers), reliable (deterministic scoring aligned with classical abduction), and open-ended (scores improve only when models produce new plausible hypotheses, unlike static benchmarks that saturate once accuracy is high). Using GEAR, we conduct a fine-grained study of nine LLMs on four abduction benchmarks with 1,500 problems, generating over 50,000 candidate hypotheses and revealing model differences obscured by gold-answer or purely human evaluations. We further propose a momentum-based curriculum that adjusts GEAR-derived training data by learning velocity: it starts with what the model learns quickly and shifts toward harder objectives such as generating diverse hypotheses once the model is confident on foundational objectives. Without gold-label supervision, this strategy improves all GEAR objectives and these gains transfer to established abductive reasoning benchmarks. Taken together, GEAR provides a principled framework that evaluates abduction and supplies label-free, scalable training signals that help LLMs produce more diverse and reliable hypotheses.",

        "summary": "Sequence classification is essential in NLP for understanding and categorizing language patterns in tasks like sentiment analysis, intent detection, and topic classification. Transformer-based models, despite achieving state-of-the-art performance, have inherent limitations due to quadratic time and memory complexity, restricting their input length. Although extensive efforts have aimed at reducing computational demands, processing extensive contexts remains challenging. To overcome these limitations, we propose ResFormer, a novel neural network architecture designed to model varying context lengths efficiently through a cascaded methodology. ResFormer integrates an reservoir computing network featuring a nonlinear readout to effectively capture long-term contextual dependencies in linear time. Concurrently, short-term dependencies within sentences are modeled using a conventional Transformer architecture with fixed-length inputs. Experiments demonstrate that ResFormer significantly outperforms baseline models of DeepSeek-Qwen and ModernBERT, delivering an accuracy improvement of up to +22.3% on the EmoryNLP dataset and consistent gains on MultiWOZ, MELD, and IEMOCAP. In addition, ResFormer exhibits reduced memory consumption, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in modeling extensive contextual information.",

        "summary": "While diffusion language models (DLMs) offer a promising alternative to autoregressive models (ARs), existing open-source DLMs suffer from high inference latency. This bottleneck is mainly due to the attention's quadratic complexity with respect to context length in computing all query-key pairs. Intuitively, to reduce this complexity, a natural strategy is to restrict attention to sparse patterns that retain only the most relevant connections. Such approaches are well-established in ARs, where attention follows fixed and clearly defined sparse patterns. However, in DLMs, we observe distinct sparsity behaviors: (1) attention patterns vary across heads, (2) attention patterns in each head remain highly similar across denoising steps, and (3) early denoising steps are critical for generation. These findings render sparse attention methods designed for ARs largely incompatible with DLMs, as they fail to capture head-specific structures and risk degrading generation when applied in early denoising steps. To address these challenges, we propose SparseD, a novel sparse attention method for DLMs. Leveraging the observations, SparseD only requires pre-computing head-specific sparse patterns one time, and reuses them across all steps. This prevents recomputing sparse patterns at each denoising step. Meanwhile, SparseD uses full attention in the early steps, then switches to sparse attention later to maintain generation quality. Together, these establish SparseD as a practical and efficient solution for deploying DLMs in long-context applications. Experimental results demonstrate that SparseD achieves lossless acceleration, delivering up to $1.50\\times$ speedup over FlashAttention at a 64k context length with 1,024 denoising steps.",

        "summary": "Diffusion language models (DLMs) have strong theoretical efficiency but are limited by fixed-length decoding and incompatibility with key-value (KV) caches. Block diffusion mitigates these issues, yet still enforces a fixed block size and requires expensive training. We introduce Next Sequence Prediction (NSP), which unifies next-token and next-block prediction, enabling the model to adaptively determine the generation length at each step. When the length is fixed to 1, NSP reduces to standard next-token prediction. Building on NSP, we propose Sequential Diffusion Language Model (SDLM), which can retrofit pre-trained autoregressive language models (ALMs) at minimal cost. Specifically, SDLM performs diffusion inference within fixed-size mask blocks, but dynamically decodes consecutive subsequences based on model confidence, thereby preserving KV-cache compatibility and improving robustness to varying uncertainty and semantics across the sequence. Experiments show that SDLM matches or surpasses strong autoregressive baselines using only 3.5M training samples, while achieving 2.1 higher throughput than Qwen-2.5. Notably, the SDLM-32B model delivers even more pronounced efficiency gains, demonstrating the strong scalability potential of our modeling paradigm.

To address this gap, we propose MCPMark, a benchmark designed to evaluate MCP use in a more realistic and comprehensive manner. It consists of $127$ high-quality tasks collaboratively created by domain experts and AI agents. Each task begins with a curated initial state and includes a programmatic script for automatic verification. These tasks demand richer and more diverse interactions with the environment, involving a broad range of create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) operations. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of cutting-edge LLMs using a minimal agent framework that operates in a tool-calling loop. Empirical results show that the best-performing model, gpt-5-medium, reaches only $52.56$\\% pass@1 and $33.86$\\% pass^4, while other widely regarded strong models, including claude-sonnet-4 and o3, fall below $30$\\% pass@1 and $15$\\% pass^4.

We evaluated performance on the Flores+ benchmark and through human judgments of conversational translations in French, Hindi, and Kannada. Our analysis of carbon emissions per evaluation run revealed that the full 3.3B fp32 model, while achieving the highest BLEU scores, incurred the largest environmental footprint (about 0.007-0.008 kg CO2 per run). The distilled models achieved an inference of up to 4.5x faster than the full 3.3B model, with only minimal reductions in BLEU scores. Human evaluations also showed that even aggressive quantization (INT4) preserved high levels of accuracy and fluency, with differences between models generally minor. These findings demonstrate that model compression strategies can substantially reduce computational demands and environmental impact while maintaining competitive translation quality, though trade-offs are more pronounced in low-resource settings.

In this work, we introduce Preference alignment of Large Language Models via Residual Steering (PaLRS), a training-free method that exploits preference signals encoded in the residual streams of LLMs. From as few as one hundred preference pairs, PaLRS extracts lightweight, plug-and-play steering vectors that can be applied at inference time to push models toward preferred behaviors. We evaluate PaLRS on various small-to-medium-scale open-source LLMs, showing that PaLRS-aligned models achieve consistent gains on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks while preserving baseline general-purpose performance. Moreover, when compared to DPO-aligned models, they perform better with huge time savings. Our findings highlight that PaLRS offers an effective, much more efficient and flexible alternative to standard preference optimization pipelines, offering a training-free, plug-and-play mechanism for alignment with minimal data.",

Such reliance on a single modality, however, constrains performance in contexts where disambiguation and adequacy depend on additional cues, such as visual, situational, or pragmatic information. This paper introduces Vision-Grounded Interpreting (VGI), a novel approach designed to address the limitations of unimodal machine interpreting. We present a prototype system that integrates a vision-language model to process both speech and visual input from a webcam, with the aim of priming the translation process through contextual visual information. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we constructed a hand-crafted diagnostic corpus targeting three types of ambiguity. In our evaluation, visual grounding substantially improves lexical disambiguation, yields modest and less stable gains for gender resolution, and shows no benefit for syntactic ambiguities. We argue that embracing multimodality represents a necessary step forward for advancing translation quality in machine interpreting.",

We use human forecasters as a comparative reference to analyze prediction shifts and confidence calibration under updated contexts. While LLMs demonstrate some responsiveness to new information, their updates are often inconsistent or overly conservative.

Despite these advantages, decoding strategies and reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms tailored for MDLMs remain underexplored. A naive approach is to directly transfer techniques well-established for AR models to MDLMs. However, this raises an immediate question: Is such a naive transfer truly optimal? For example, 1) Block-wise and semi-AR decoding strategies are not employed during the training of MDLMs, so why do they outperform full diffusion-style decoding during inference? 2) Applying RL algorithms designed for AR models directly to MDLMs exhibits a training-inference inconsistency, since MDLM decoding are non-causal (parallel). This results in inconsistencies between the rollout trajectory and the optimization trajectory. To address these challenges, we propose EOS Early Rejection (EOSER) and Ascending Step-Size (ASS) decoding scheduler, which unlock the potential of MDLMs to perform full diffusion-style decoding, achieving competitive performance with fewer decoding steps. Additionally, we introduce Consistency Trajectory Group Relative Policy Optimization (CJ-GRPO) for taming MDLMs, which emphasizes the consistency between rollout trajectory and optimization trajectory, and reduces the optimization errors caused by skip-step optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on reasoning tasks, such as mathematical and planning benchmarks, using LLaDA-8B-Instruct.

To address this, we introduce DocPruner, the first framework to employ adaptive patch-level embedding pruning for VDR to effectively reduce the storage overhead.

        "summary": "As supervised fine-tuning (SFT) evolves from a lightweight post-training step into a compute-intensive phase rivaling mid-training in scale, data efficiency has become critical for aligning large language models (LLMs) under tight budgets. Existing data pruning methods suffer from a fragmented design: they operate either at the sample level or the token level in isolation, failing to jointly optimize both dimensions. This disconnect leads to significant inefficiencies--high-value samples may still contain redundant tokens, while token-level pruning often discards crucial instructional or corrective signals embedded in individual examples. To address this bottleneck, we introduce the Error-Uncertainty (EU) Plane, a diagnostic framework that jointly characterizes the heterogeneous utility of training data across samples and tokens. Guided by this insight, we propose Quadrant-based Tuning (Q-Tuning), a unified framework that strategically coordinates sample pruning and token pruning. Q-Tuning employs a two-stage strategy: first, it performs sample-level triage to retain examples rich in informative misconceptions or calibration signals; second, it applies an asymmetric token-pruning policy, using a context-aware scoring mechanism to trim less salient tokens exclusively from misconception samples while preserving calibration samples in their entirety. Our method sets a new state of the art across five diverse benchmarks. Remarkably, on SmolLM2-1.7B, Q-Tuning achieves a +38\\% average improvement over the full-data SFT baseline using only 12.5\\% of the original training data. As the first dynamic pruning approach to consistently outperform full-data training, Q-Tuning provides a practical and scalable blueprint for maximizing data utilization in budget-constrained LLM SFT.",

        "summary": "Progress in long-context reasoning for large language models (LLMs) has lagged behind other recent advances. This gap arises not only from the intrinsic difficulty of processing long texts, but also from the scarcity of reliable human annotations and programmatically verifiable reward signals. In this paper, we propose SPELL, a multi-role self-play reinforcement learning framework that enables scalable, label-free optimization for long-context reasoning. SPELL integrates three cyclical roles-questioner, responder, and verifier-within a single model to enable continual self-improvement. The questioner generates questions from raw documents paired with reference answers; the responder learns to solve these questions based on the documents; and the verifier evaluates semantic equivalence between the responder's output and the questioner's reference answer, producing reward signals to guide continual training. To stabilize training, we introduce an automated curriculum that gradually increases document length and a reward function that adapts question difficulty to the model's evolving capabilities. Extensive experiments on six long-context benchmarks show that SPELL consistently improves performance across diverse LLMs and outperforms equally sized models fine-tuned on large-scale annotated data. Notably, SPELL achieves an average 7.6-point gain in pass@8 on the strong reasoning model Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking, raising its performance ceiling and showing promise for scaling to even more capable models.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success on question answering (QA) tasks, yet they often encode harmful biases that compromise fairness and trustworthiness. Most existing bias mitigation approaches are restricted to predefined categories, limiting their ability to address novel or context-specific emergent biases. To bridge this gap, we tackle the novel problem of open-set bias detection and mitigation in text-based QA. We introduce OpenBiasBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate biases across a wide range of categories and subgroups, encompassing both known and previously unseen biases. Additionally, we propose Open-DeBias, a novel, data-efficient, and parameter-efficient debiasing method that leverages adapter modules to mitigate existing social and stereotypical biases while generalizing to unseen ones. Compared to the state-of-the-art BMBI method, Open-DeBias improves QA accuracy on BBQ dataset by nearly $48\\%$ on ambiguous subsets and $6\\%$ on disambiguated ones, using adapters fine-tuned on just a small fraction of the training data. Remarkably, the same adapters, in a zero-shot transfer to Korean BBQ, achieve $84\\%$ accuracy, demonstrating robust language-agnostic generalization. Through extensive evaluation, we also validate the effectiveness of Open-DeBias across a broad range of NLP tasks, including StereoSet and CrowS-Pairs, highlighting its robustness, multilingual strength, and suitability for general-purpose, open-domain bias mitigation.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often fail on multiple-choice questions (MCQs) despite demonstrating correct knowledge in other contexts, such as free-form generation. To investigate the mechanism underlying this knowledge-prediction gap on MCQs and alleviate it, we conduct a probing analysis and find that residual streams in certain layers contain a subspace spanned by two important bases: a \\emph{knowledge basis} that encodes the probability of the ground-truth answer for a given MCQ and a \\emph{prediction basis} that encodes the probability of the answer choice predicted by the model. We observe that incorrect predictions arise from a misalignment of the model's hidden states along these two bases. Hence, we introduce \\textbf{KAPPA} (Knowledge-Aligned Prediction through Projection-based Adjustment), a parameter-free intervention that transforms the hidden states to align the prediction coordinate with the knowledge coordinate within this subspace. Experiments on binary-choice reformulations of Big-Bench-Hard and ARC-Challenge show that KAPPA substantially improves accuracy and consistently outperforms baselines. While optimal subspaces differ across tasks, subspaces generalize to some extent, as supported by cross-dataset experiments. Moreover, KAPPA extends its effectiveness to free-form questions beyond MCQs. Our work provides a new geometric understanding of the knowledge-prediction gap and offers a practical method for better aligning model behavior with its latent knowledge.",

However, its effectiveness is often hindered by two key challenges: the \\textit{cold-start problem}, where users with limited history provide insufficient context for accurate personalization, and the \\textit{biasing problem}, where users with abundant but skewed history cause the model to overfit to narrow preferences. We identify both issues as symptoms of a common underlying limitation, i.e., the inability to model collective knowledge across users. To address this, we propose a local-global memory framework (LoGo) that combines the personalized local memory with a collective global memory that captures shared interests across the population. To reconcile discrepancies between these two memory sources, we introduce a mediator module designed to resolve conflicts between local and global signals. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that LoGo consistently improves personalization quality by both warming up cold-start users and mitigating biased predictions. These results highlight the importance of incorporating collective knowledge to enhance LLM personalization.",

Existing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) frameworks primarily rely on preference rewards, yet they often overlook the model's internal knowledge boundaries, exacerbating the so-called \"hallucination tax\". To address this challenge, we propose Knowledge-Level Consistency Reinforcement Learning Framework (KLCF), a novel framework that focuses on the knowledge consistency between the policy model's expressed knowledge and the base model's parametric knowledge, and introduces a Dual-Fact Alignment mechanism to jointly optimize factual recall and precision. Specifically, KLCF leverages pretrained knowledge boundaries to construct fact checklist, guiding online reinforcement learning to improve factual coverage and recall; simultaneously, it trains a self-assessment module based on the base model's internal knowledge to enhance factual precision during generation. Unlike prior methods that rely on external retrieval or heavy verification, our reward design is fully external-knowledge-free and lightweight, making KLCF efficient and easily scalable to large-scale training. Experimental results demonstrate that KLCF substantially improves factuality metrics across multiple long-form benchmarks and effectively alleviates model hallucinations.",

This degradation limits the ability of speech-enabled LLMs to fully exploit their pre-trained text-based knowledge. In this work, we analyze the underlying mechanisms of this issue through a focused study of the widely used encoder-adaptor paradigm. We propose an analytical framework based on parameter importance estimation, which reveals that fine-tuning for speech introduces a textual importance distribution shift: the layer-wise allocation of parameters critical to textual reasoning is disrupted. Building on this insight, we investigate two mitigation strategies: layer-wise learning rate scheduling and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), both aim to preserve the original parameter distribution. Experimental results show that both approaches better maintain textual competence than full fine-tuning, while also improving downstream spoken question answering performance. Furthermore, our analysis offers a principled explanation for the effectiveness of the proposed mitigation strategies, linking their benefits to the structural properties of textual knowledge in LLMs.",

Yet cross-modal reasoning remains underexplored, with conflicting reports on whether added modalities help or harm performance. These inconsistencies stem from a lack of controlled evaluation frameworks and analysis of models' internals to isolate when and why modality interactions support or undermine reasoning. We address this gap through a logic-grounded evaluation framework that categorizes multimodal reasoning into six interaction patterns, varying how facts are distributed across modalities and logically combined. Empirically, additional modalities enhance reasoning only when they provide independent and sufficient reasoning paths, while redundant or chained entailment support often hurts performance. Moreover, reasoning degrades in three systematic ways: weaker modalities drag down overall performance, conflicts bias preference toward certain modalities, and joint signals from different modalities fail to be integrated effectively. Therefore, we identify two core failures: task-composition bottleneck, where recognition and reasoning cannot be jointly executed in one pass, and fusion bottleneck, where early integration introduces bias. For further investigation, we find that attention patterns fail to encode fact usefulness, but a simple two-step prompting (recognize then reason) restores performance, confirming the task-composition bottleneck. Moreover, modality identity remains recoverable in early layers, and softening attention in early fusion improves reasoning, highlighting biased fusion as another failure mode. Overall, our findings show that integration, not perception, is the main barrier to multimodal reasoning, suggesting composition-aware training and early fusion control as promising directions.",

Existing MMKGC methods follow two multi-modal paradigms: fusion-based and ensemble-based. Fusion-based methods employ fixed fusion strategies, which inevitably leads to the loss of modality-specific information and a lack of flexibility to adapt to varying modality relevance across contexts. In contrast, ensemble-based methods retain modality independence through dedicated sub-models but struggle to capture the nuanced, context-dependent semantic interplay between modalities. To overcome these dual limitations, we propose a novel MMKGC method M-Hyper, which achieves the coexistence and collaboration of fused and independent modality representations. Our method integrates the strengths of both paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal interactions while maintaining modality-specific information. Inspired by ``quaternion'' algebra, we utilize its four orthogonal bases to represent multiple independent modalities and employ the Hamilton product to efficiently model pair-wise interactions among them. Specifically, we introduce a Fine-grained Entity Representation Factorization (FERF) module and a Robust Relation-aware Modality Fusion (R2MF) module to obtain robust representations for three independent modalities and one fused modality. The resulting four modality representations are then mapped to the four orthogonal bases of a biquaternion (a hypercomplex extension of quaternion) for comprehensive modality interaction.

To achieve this, RemeDi jointly predicts token distributions and per-token confidence scores at each step. The confidence scores determine which tokens to be unmasked after the current step, allowing the model to identify tokens with low quality and remask them. These remasked tokens can be resampled with richer context in subsequent steps. We design a remask-aware pipeline to train this ability, including supervised fine-tuning which teaches the model to detect and remask incorrect tokens in addition to predict mask tokens, and reinforcement learning which optimizes full generation trajectories toward higher rewards.

        "summary": "Post-training, which elicits a pretrained Base model into the corresponding Instruct model, is widely considered to be superficial. In this work, we first reinforce this hypothesis by providing novel quantitative evidence from the weight level that the effective rank (eRank) remains negligibly changed. However, this superficiality also suffers a critical trade-off, improving the exploitation capabilities at the cost of limiting its exploration. To tackle this issue, we propose Timber, a simple yet effective training-free method that enhances the exploration capability of the Instruct model while preserving its exploitation. The key insight is to partially revert Instruct towards the paired Base model by subtle yet targeted refinement of the weight deltas. Extensive experiments on Llama and Qwen series demonstrate that Timber consistently improves vanilla Instruct models, particularly on Pass@k performance. Our findings offer new insights into the post-training stage at the weight level and practical strategies to refine the Instruct model without training.",

        "summary": "Although Large Language Models have demonstrated powerful capabilities in a wide range of tasks such as language understanding and code generation, the frequent occurrence of hallucinations during the generation process has become a significant impediment to their deployment in critical application scenarios. Current mainstream hallucination detection methods rely on factual consistency verification or static hidden layer features. The former is constrained by the scope of knowledge coverage, while the latter struggles to capture reasoning biases during the inference process. To address these issues, and inspired by signal analysis methods in cognitive neuroscience, this paper proposes a hallucination detection method based on the frequency-domain analysis of hidden layer temporal signals, named HSAD (\\textbf{H}idden \\textbf{S}ignal \\textbf{A}nalysis-based \\textbf{D}etection). First, by treating the LLM's reasoning process as a cognitive journey that unfolds over time, we propose modeling and simulating the human process of signal perception and discrimination in a deception-detection scenario through hidden layer temporal signals. Next, The Fast Fourier Transform is applied to map these temporal signals into the frequency domain to construct spectral features, which are used to capture anomalies that arise during the reasoning process; analysis experiments on these spectral features have proven the effectiveness of this approach. Finally, a hallucination detection algorithm is designed based on these spectral features to identify hallucinations in the generated content. By effectively combining the modeling of the reasoning process with frequency-domain feature extraction, the HSAD method overcomes the limitations of existing approaches in terms of knowledge coverage and the detection of reasoning biases, demonstrating higher detection accuracy and robustness.",

Yet, to our knowledge, there is no open, real-world, execution-based benchmark for mapping natural language queries to JQL. We introduce Jackal, a novel, large-scale text-to-JQL benchmark comprising 100,000 natural language (NL) requests paired with validated JQL queries and execution-based results on a live Jira instance with over 200,000 issues. To reflect real-world usage, each JQL query is associated with four types of user requests: (i) Long NL, (ii) Short NL, (iii) Semantically Similar, and (iv) Semantically Exact. We release Jackal, a corpus of 100,000 text-to-JQL pairs, together with an execution-based scoring toolkit, and a static snapshot of the evaluated Jira instance for reproducibility. We report text-to-JQL results on 23 Large Language Models (LLMs) spanning parameter sizes, open and closed source models, across execution accuracy, exact match, and canonical exact match. In this paper, we report results on Jackal-5K, a 5,000-pair subset of Jackal. On Jackal-5K, the best overall model (Gemini 2.5 Pro) achieves only 60.3% execution accuracy averaged equally across four user request types. Performance varies significantly across user request types: (i) Long NL (86.0%), (ii) Short NL (35.7%), (iii) Semantically Similar (22.7%), and (iv) Semantically Exact (99.3%). By benchmarking LLMs on their ability to produce correct and executable JQL queries, Jackal exposes the limitations of current state-of-the-art LLMs and sets a new, execution-based challenge for future research in Jira enterprise data.",

        "summary": "The LLM-as-a-judge paradigm is widely used in both evaluating free-text model responses and reward modeling for model alignment and finetuning. Recently, finetuning judges with judge-specific data has emerged as an often preferred choice over directly prompting frontier models as judges, as the former achieves better performance with smaller model sizes while being more robust to common biases. However, the standard evaluation ignores several practical concerns of finetuned judges regarding their real world deployment. In this paper, we identify and formalize three aspects that affect the shelf life of these judges: future proofing and backward compatibility -- how well judges finetuned on responses by today's generator models perform on responses by future models or past models, as well as question generalization -- how well judges generalize to unseen questions at test time. We study these three aspects in the math domain under a unified framework with varying train and test distributions, three SFT- and DPO-based finetuning algorithms and three different base models. Experiments suggest that future-proofing is challenging for most models, while backward compatibility is relatively easy, with DPO-trained models consistently improving performance. We further find that continual learning provides a more balanced adaptation to shifts between older and newer response distributions than training solely on stronger or weaker responses. Moreover, all models observe certain degrees of performance degradation when moving from questions seen during training to unseen ones, showing that current judges do not fully generalize to unseen questions. These findings provide insights into practical considerations for developing and deploying judge models in the face of ever-changing generators.",

        "summary": "Natural language processing (NLP), particularly sentiment analysis, plays a vital role in areas like marketing, customer service, and social media monitoring by providing insights into user opinions and emotions. However, progress in Arabic sentiment analysis remains limited due to the lack of large, high-quality labeled datasets. While active learning has proven effective in reducing annotation efforts in other languages, few studies have explored it in Arabic sentiment tasks. Likewise, the use of large language models (LLMs) for assisting annotation and comparing their performance to human labeling is still largely unexplored in the Arabic context. In this paper, we propose an active learning framework for Arabic sentiment analysis designed to reduce annotation costs while maintaining high performance. We evaluate multiple deep learning architectures: Specifically, long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent units (GRU), and recurrent neural networks (RNN), across three benchmark datasets: Hunger Station, AJGT, and MASAC, encompassing both modern standard Arabic and dialectal variations. Additionally, two annotation strategies are compared: Human labeling and LLM-assisted labeling. Five LLMs are evaluated as annotators: GPT-4o, Claude 3 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, DeepSeek Chat, and LLaMA 3 70B Instruct. For each dataset, the best-performing LLM was used: GPT-4o for Hunger Station, Claude 3 Sonnet for AJGT, and DeepSeek Chat for MASAC. Our results show that LLM-assisted active learning achieves competitive or superior performance compared to human labeling. For example, on the Hunger Station dataset, the LSTM model achieved 93% accuracy with only 450 labeled samples using GPT-4o-generated labels, while on the MASAC dataset, DeepSeek Chat reached 82% accuracy with 650 labeled samples, matching the accuracy obtained through human labeling.",

Traditional approaches to item difficulty modeling rely on field testing and classical test theory (CTT)-based item analysis or item response theory (IRT) calibration, which can be time-consuming and costly. To overcome these challenges, text-based approaches leveraging machine learning and language models, have emerged as promising alternatives. This paper reviews and synthesizes 37 articles on automated item difficulty prediction in large-scale assessment settings published through May 2025. For each study, we delineate the dataset, difficulty parameter, subject domain, item type, number of items, training and test data split, input, features, model, evaluation criteria, and model performance outcomes. Results showed that although classic machine learning models remain relevant due to their interpretability, state-of-the-art language models, using both small and large transformer-based architectures, can capture syntactic and semantic patterns without the need for manual feature engineering. Uniquely, model performance outcomes were summarized to serve as a benchmark for future research and overall, text-based methods have the potential to predict item difficulty with root mean square error (RMSE) as low as 0.165, Pearson correlation as high as 0.87, and accuracy as high as 0.806.

This paper introduces Cognition-of-Thought (CooT), a novel decoding-time framework that equips LLMs with an explicit cognitive self-monitoring loop. CooT couples a standard text Generator with a cognitive Perceiver that continuously monitors the unfolding sequence. The Perceiver uses a structured, precedence-based hierarchy of principles (e.g., safety over obedience) to detect potential misalignments as they arise. When violations are flagged, CooT intervenes by rolling back the generation to the point of error and regenerating under injected guidance that combines universal social priors with context-specific warnings. CooT thus transforms alignment from a fixed property into an explicit, dynamic, and auditable process active during inference, allowing for flexible policy updates without retraining the model. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and model families confirm that CooT consistently improves safety and social reasoning performance.",

Existing computational approaches to explicitating these terms have focused exclusively on in-text solutions, overlooking paratextual apparatus in the footnotes and endnotes employed by professional translators. In this paper, we formalize Genette's (1987) theory of paratexts from literary and translation studies to introduce the task of paratextual explicitation for MT. We construct a dataset of 560 expert-aligned paratexts from four English translations of the classical Chinese short story collection Liaozhai and evaluate LLMs with and without reasoning traces on choice and content of explicitation. Experiments across intrinsic prompting and agentic retrieval methods establish the difficulty of this task, with human evaluation showing that LLM-generated paratexts improve audience comprehension, though remain considerably less effective than translator-authored ones. Beyond model performance, statistical analysis reveals that even professional translators vary widely in their use of paratexts, suggesting that cultural mediation is inherently open-ended rather than prescriptive. Our findings demonstrate the potential of paratextual explicitation in advancing MT beyond linguistic equivalence, with promising extensions to monolingual explanation and personalized adaptation.",

While automatic prompt optimization offers a scalable alternative to costly manual design, generating effective prompts remains challenging. Existing methods often struggle to stably generate improved prompts, leading to low efficiency, and overlook that prompt optimization easily gets trapped in local optima. Addressing this, we propose GRACE, a framework that integrates two synergistic strategies: Gated Refinement and Adaptive Compression, achieving Efficient prompt optimization. The gated refinement strategy introduces a feedback regulation gate and an update rejection gate, which refine update signals to produce stable and effective prompt improvements. When optimization stagnates, the adaptive compression strategy distills the prompt's core concepts, restructuring the optimization trace and opening new paths. By strategically introducing information loss through refinement and compression, GRACE delivers substantial gains in performance and efficiency. In extensive experiments on 11 tasks across three practical domains, including BIG-Bench Hard (BBH), domain-specific, and general NLP tasks, GRACE achieves significant average relative performance improvements of 4.7%, 4.4% and 2.7% over state-of-the-art methods, respectively. Further analysis shows that GRACE achieves these gains using only 25% of the prompt generation budget required by prior methods, highlighting its high optimization efficiency and low computational overhead.

To overcome this constraint, we propose to conduct multiple pretraining experiments simultaneously during a single training run. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by conducting ten experiments during the training of a 1.5B parameter model on 210B tokens. Although we only train a single model, we can replicate the results from multiple previous works on data contamination, poisoning, and memorization. We also conduct novel investigations into knowledge acquisition, mathematical reasoning, and watermarking. For example, we dynamically update the training data until the model acquires a particular piece of knowledge. Remarkably, the influence of the ten experiments on the model's training dynamics and overall performance is minimal. However, interactions between different experiments may act as a potential confounder in our approach. We propose to test for interactions with continual pretraining experiments, finding them to be negligible in our setup. Overall, our findings suggest that performing multiple pretraining experiments in a single training run can enable rigorous scientific experimentation with large models on a compute budget.",

Composing this vector with a target language model yields a Target Guard Model (TGM). We then adapt TGM with a streaming-aware approach that combines prefix-based training and evaluation with a classifier that produces a single-token output. With this composition alone, TGM improves classification quality over established Guard Models across standard safety suites and enables language extensibility to Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, requiring neither additional training nor target language labels. It also demonstrates model portability across two widely used public guardrail backbones, Llama and Gemma. With prefix SFT (supervised fine-tuning), TGM preserves classification quality under streaming by aligning the behavior between prefix inputs and full-text inputs. The single-token output design increases throughput and reduces latency. Together, these components reduce data and compute requirements while promoting streaming-aware evaluation practices, thereby contributing to a more responsible AI ecosystem.",

However, they often generate clinically unsupported descriptions, known as medical hallucinations, which pose serious risks in medical applications that demand accuracy and image-grounded outputs. Through empirical analysis, we find that prompt-induced hallucinations remain prevalent in radiology MLLMs, largely due to over-sensitivity to clinical sections. To address this, we introduce Clinical Contrastive Cecoding (CCD), a training-free and retrieval-free inference framework that integrates structured clinical signals from task-specific radiology expert models. CCD introduces a dual-stage contrastive mechanism to refine token-level logits during generation, thereby enhancing clinical fidelity without modifying the base MLLM. Experiments on three datasets and multiple models demonstrate that CCD consistently improves overall performance on radiology report generation (RRG). On the MIMIC-CXR dataset, it yields up to a 17% improvement in RadGraph-F1 when applied to state-of-the-art RRG models. Our approach provides a lightweight and generalisable solution for mitigating medical hallucinations, effectively bridging expert models and MLLMs in radiology.",

A significant challenge in this process is the distribution mismatch between pre-collected offline preference data and the evolving model policy. Existing methods attempt to reduce this gap using static heuristics or decoupled online sampling strategies, but they often fail to adapt to the model's dynamic learning state. To bridge this gap, we propose Meta-Weighted Adaptive Preference Optimization (MetaAPO), a novel framework that dynamically couples data generation with model training. MetaAPO employs a lightweight meta-learner, as an \"alignment gap estimator\", to evaluate the potential benefits of on-policy sampling in relation to offline data. This guides targeted online generation and assigns sample-wise meta-weights to the optimization objective, dynamically balancing the quality and distribution of online and offline data. Experiments on AlpacaEval 2, Arena-Hard and MT-Bench demonstrate that MetaAPO consistently outperforms existing preference optimization approaches across various settings, while reducing 42% in online annotation costs.",

Recent knowledge distillation-based methods aim to address these issues through teacher-guided error correction, but this LLM as judge approach remains challenging in terms of cost, time, and efficiency. To circumvent this issue, we propose a novel two-stage framework, MedCritical, which uses a small language model fine-tuned by a large teacher model to play against itself. In the first stage, we extract high-level and detailed long-chain thought templates from the teacher model to guide the student model to generate more complex reasoning thoughts. In the second stage, we introduce direct preference optimization (DPO) through model self-iteration collaboration to enhance the reasoning ability of the student model by playing against the correction trajectory of the fine-tuned model during training. This model self-learning DPO approach teaches the student model to use its own error-driven insights to consolidate its skills and knowledge to solve complex problems, and achieves comparable results to traditional knowledge distillation methods using teacher models at a lower cost. Notably, our MedCritical 7B model outperforms the Taiyi and Huatuo-o1-7B models by 3.04\\% and 10.12\\% respectively on the CMExam benchmark, achieving new SOTA performance among 7B-class small models.",

Yet state-of-the-art (SOTA) unlearning methods often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and metric imbalance, for example by over-optimizing one objective (e.g., unlearning effectiveness, utility preservation, or privacy protection) at the expense of others. In addition, small perturbations in the representation or parameter space can be exploited by relearn and jailbreak attacks. To address these challenges, we propose PRISM, a unified framework that enforces dual-space smoothness in representation and parameter spaces to improve robustness and balance unlearning metrics. PRISM consists of two smoothness optimization stages: (i) a representation space stage that employs a robustly trained probe to defend against jailbreak attacks, and (ii) a parameter-space stage that decouples retain-forget gradient conflicts, reduces imbalance, and smooths the parameter space to mitigate relearning attacks. Extensive experiments on WMDP and MUSE, across conversational-dialogue and continuous-text settings, show that PRISM outperforms SOTA baselines under multiple attacks while achieving a better balance among key metrics.",

In this paper, we introduce Consensus-Evolve (C-Evolve), an evolutionary algorithm that discovers a group of prompts whose aggregated outputs after majority voting achieve optimal performance. More specifically, C-Evolve employs an island-based evolutionary algorithm to maintain population diversity, and prompts from distinct islands are selected to form groups to aggregate their outputs. The key difference from single individual evolution is a voting score, which evaluates each individual prompt's contribution within groups. We take this as the fitness score for evolution instead of individual performance. Consequently, C-Evolve is more likely to produce and maintain prompts with higher potential to form a high-performing group and eliminate low-performing ones, gradually improving the group performance after reaching consensus. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of tasks, including both open-ended tasks like HotpotQA and closed-ended tasks like MATH. On Qwen3-8B, C-Evolve achieves 70.67% on HotpotQA and 43.88% on IFBench, which are 4.95% and 2.73% higher than GEPA, respectively. For GPT-4.1-mini, the accuracy on IFBench is further improved to 47.96% and reaches 95.33% in the MATH benchmark. These results demonstrate the C-Evolve's competitive performance.",

As the intrinsic properties of the environment determine the abilities that LLMs can learn, the environment plays a important role in the RL finetuning process. An ideal LLM reasoning environment should possess three core characteristics: scalability, generalizable reasoning, and verifiability. However, existing mathematical and coding environments are difficult to scale due to heavy reliance on expert annotation, while the skills learned in game-based environments are too specialized to generalize. To bridge this gap, we introduce the \\textbf{S}tructured \\textbf{I}n-context \\textbf{E}nvironment (SIE) framework. SIE achieves scalability by automatically constructing reasoning environments from large-scale structured data, where the rich compositional patterns naturally support generalizable reasoning. Moreover, the explicit schemas and reasoning chains in structured data provide a foundation for rule-based verifiability. Experimental results show that SIE framework not only achieves substantial improvements in in-domain structured reasoning, but also enables the learned compositional reasoning skills to generalize effectively to out-of-domain mathematical and logical reasoning tasks. We further explored learning in information-limited partial SIEs and found that LLMs can infer the missing information through exploring the environment, leading to robust reasoning improvements and generalization performance.",

In these settings, LLMs must not only issue accurate function calls at each step but also maintain progress awareness, the ability to summarize past interactions and plan future actions to ensure coherent, long-horizon task execution. Existing approaches, however, either reduce multi-turn training to isolated single-turn samples, which neglects task-level planning, or employ end-to-end reinforcement learning (RL) that struggles with redundancy and lacks explicit integration of progress awareness. To overcome these limitations, we introduce PARL-MT, a framework that explicitly incorporates progress awareness into LLM training for multi-turn function calling. PARL-MT combines (i) a Progress Awareness Generation (PAG) pipeline, which automatically constructs datasets coupling conversation summaries with future task planning, and (ii) a Progress Awareness-Guided Reinforcement Learning (PAG-RL) algorithm, which integrates progress awareness into RL training to reduce contextual redundancy and improve alignment between local actions and global task completion.

This paper is a primary investigation into the linguistic strategies employed in K-pop songs that achieve global chart success, with a focus on the role of code-switching and English lyric usage. A dataset of K-pop songs that appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 and Global 200 charts from 2017 to 2025, spanning 14 groups and 8 solo artists, was compiled. Using this dataset, the proportion of English and Korean lyrics, the frequency of code-switching, and other stylistic features were analysed. It was found that English dominates the linguistic landscape of globally charting K-pop songs, with both male and female performers exhibiting high degrees of code-switching and English usage. Statistical tests indicated no significant gender-based differences, although female solo artists tend to favour English more consistently. A classification task was also performed to predict performer gender from lyrics, achieving macro F1 scores up to 0.76 using multilingual embeddings and handcrafted features. Finally, differences between songs charting on the Hot 100 versus the Global 200 were examined, suggesting that, while there is no significant gender difference in English, higher English usage may be more critical for success in the US-focused Hot 100. The findings highlight how linguistic choices in K-pop lyrics are shaped by global market pressures and reveal stylistic patterns that reflect performer identity and chart context.",

        "summary": "Recent reasoning LLMs (RLMs), especially those trained with verifier-based reinforcement learning, often perform worse with few-shot CoT than with direct answering. We revisit this paradox using high-quality reasoning traces from DeepSeek-R1 as demonstrations and find that adding more exemplars consistently degrades accuracy, even when demonstrations are optimal. A detailed analysis reveals two mechanisms behind this decline: (i) semantic misguidance, where high textual similarity leads the model to treat the target as the same as the exemplar and to copy intermediate steps verbatim; and (ii) strategy transfer failure, where the model struggles to extract useful reasoning strategies and apply them to target questions. Guided by these, we introduce Insight-to-Solve (I2S), a sequential test-time procedure that turns demonstrations into explicit, reusable insights and derives a target-specific reasoning trace; optionally, the reasoning is self-refined for coherence and correctness (I2S+). Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks show that I2S and I2S+ consistently outperform both direct answering and test-time scaling baselines across open- and closed-source models. Even for GPT models, our method helps: on AIME'25, GPT-4.1 rises by +14.0%, and o1-mini improves by +2.7% on AIME and +1.7% on GPQA, indicating that in-context demonstrations can be harnessed effectively via insight-refine-solve framework.",

        "summary": "A central question in psycholinguistics is the timing of syntax in sentence processing. Much of the existing evidence comes from violation paradigms, which conflate two separable processes - syntactic category detection and phrase structure construction - and implicitly assume that phrase structure follows category detection. In this study, we use co-registered EEG and eye-tracking data from the ZuCo corpus to disentangle these processes and test their temporal order under naturalistic reading conditions. Analyses of gaze transitions showed that readers preferentially moved between syntactic heads, suggesting that phrase structures, rather than serial word order, organize scanpaths. Bayesian network modeling further revealed that structural depth was the strongest driver of deviations from linear reading, outweighing lexical familiarity and surprisal. Finally, fixation-related potentials demonstrated that syntactic surprisal influences neural activity before word onset (-184 to -10 ms) and during early integration (48 to 300 ms). These findings extend current models of syntactic timing by showing that phrase structure construction can precede category detection and dominate lexical influences, supporting a predictive \"tree-scaffolding\" account of comprehension.",

Moreover, widely used macro-level metrics (e.g., pass@k) obscure these micro-level violations and offer little actionable guidance for remedy. In this work, we present a full-stack, three-stage framework: (1) Diagnose - Contextualized Role Adherence Score (CRAS), a query-wise, context-aware scoring metric that decomposes role adherence into four measurable dimensions; (2) Localize - attention drift analysis revealing that instruction conflicts are resolved by attention heads that are largely concentrated in middle layers; (3) Align - Surgical Alignment of Instruction Layers (SAIL), which installs LoRA only on the localized focal layers and optimizes a token-weighted DPO-style preference objective that credits tokens by their focal attentional contribution. Across standard benchmarks and MAS frameworks, our surgical approach improves instruction hierarchy compliance (e.g., +5.60% with AutoGen on MedQA) without full-model finetuning.",

Our approach pretrains a language model (LM) to first generate an intermediate latent thought-the last hidden state of the current position-which is then used as input to predict the actual subsequent token. This additional computational step enables the LM to refine its prediction within unconstrained continuous space. Our experiments demonstrate that, at an identical inference cost, a LM that generates one additional latent thought per token outperforms a standard model with double the parameters. For instance, ours-1.4B (Pythia Arch), pretrained on 300B tokens from the Pile, significantly surpasses the vanilla Pythia-2.8B trained on the same data on both language modeling and a range of general downstream tasks. Furthermore, increasing the number of latent thoughts generated before each actual token-forming a chain analogous to CoT-consistently improves the model's performance.",

ROSA guides the model parameters toward a theoretical optimal policy in a single, efficient update step, avoiding costly iterative gradient-based optimization and minimizing computational overhead. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis guaranteeing that the policy of ROSA converges to the preference of user as the number of interactions increases.

Applying tree search to Masked Diffusion Language Models, however, introduces two key challenges: (i) parallel unmasking yields highly correlated branches, limiting exploration, and (ii) reward evaluation via sampled completions produces high-variance estimates, making pruning unstable. We propose TReASURe, a tree-search test-time alignment method that addresses these issues. It introduces (i) UnmaskBranch, a branching strategy based on first-hitting unmasking that diversifies both token content and reveal order with a single model call per parent node, and (ii) ResubstituteScore, a pruning rule that uses deterministic resubstitution to score partially masked sequences with low-variance proxy completions. Theoretically, we quantify branching efficiency gains in NFEs (number of function evaluations), show that the scoring rule approximates the true reward with error bounded by predictive uncertainty, and prove improvements with larger tree widths. Empirically, TReASURe achieves state-of-the-art results on perplexity, linguistic acceptability, and control of sentiment and toxicity, outperforming prior methods under matched compute budgets, with especially strong gains in low-NFE regimes.",

Abstract: Tool agents interact with users through multi-turn dialogues to accomplish various tasks. Recent studies have adopted user simulation methods to develop these agents in multi-turn settings. However, existing user simulators tend to be agent-friendly, exhibiting only cooperative behaviors, which fails to train and test agents against non-collaborative users in the real world. To address this, we propose a novel user simulator architecture that simulates four categories of non-collaborative behaviors: requesting unavailable services, digressing into tangential conversations, expressing impatience, and providing incomplete utterances. Our user simulator can simulate challenging and natural non-collaborative behaviors while reliably delivering all intents and information necessary to accomplish the task. Our experiments on MultiWOZ and $\\tau$-bench reveal significant performance degradation in state-of-the-art tool agents when encountering non-collaborative users. We provide detailed analyses of agents' weaknesses under each non-collaborative condition, such as escalated hallucinations and dialogue breakdowns. Ultimately, we contribute an easily extensible user simulation framework to help the research community develop tool agents and preemptively diagnose them under challenging real-world conditions within their own services.",

Large language models (LLMs) can learn to perform a wide range of tasks from just a few examples. However, generating valid molecules using representations like SMILES is challenging for LLMs in few-shot settings. In this work, we explore how LLMs can generate 100% valid molecules. We evaluate whether LLMs can use SELFIES, a representation where every string corresponds to a valid molecule, for valid molecule generation but find that LLMs perform worse with SELFIES than with SMILES. We then examine LLMs' ability to correct invalid SMILES and find their capacity limited. Finally, we introduce SmiSelf, a cross-chemical language framework for invalid SMILES correction. SmiSelf converts invalid SMILES to SELFIES using grammatical rules, leveraging SELFIES' mechanisms to correct the invalid SMILES. Experiments show that SmiSelf ensures 100% validity while preserving molecular characteristics and maintaining or even enhancing performance on other metrics. SmiSelf helps expand LLMs' practical applications in biomedicine and is compatible with all SMILES-based generative models. Code is available at https://github.com/wentao228/SmiSelf.",

While reinforcement learning offers a potential solution, it suffers from sparse rewards and the limited reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Meanwhile, existing data synthesis methods only produce chain-of-thought rationales and fail to model environmental interactions. In this paper, we propose EviPath, an evidence-anchored reasoning path synthesis paradigm for RAG agent development. EviPath comprises: (i) Abductive Subtask Planning, which decomposes the problem into sub-questions and iteratively plans an optimal solution path based on the dependencies between them; (ii) Faithful Sub-question Answering, which uses supporting evidence to construct a proxy environment to generate reasoning thoughts and answers for each sub-question; and (iii) Conversational Fine-Tuning, which formats the complete agent-environment interaction trajectory into a dialogue format suitable for Supervised Fine-Tuning. EviPath allows LLMs to learn complex reasoning and tool-use capabilities directly from synthesized data. Extensive experiments on widely-used question-answering benchmarks show that an 8B parameter model trained with EviPath-synthesized data significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines with a double-digit absolute EM gain of 14.7% in open-domain question answering.",

Straightforward unsupervised signals like majority voting have proven effective in generating pseudo-labels for verifiable tasks, while their applicability to unverifiable tasks (e.g., translation) is limited by the open-ended character of responses. As a result, self-evaluation mechanisms (e.g., self-judging and entropy minimization) are predominantly used to derive pseudo-labels. However, self-evaluation relying on LLMs typically incurs high computational overhead and introduces overconfidence issues due to intrinsic biases. To address these challenges, we propose a novel self-evaluation-free approach for unverifiable tasks, designed for lightweight yet effective self-improvement. Inspired by majority voting commonly employed in verifiable tasks, we propose semantic voting as a novel mechanism that relaxes the principle of hard matching (i.e., exact matching) toward soft matching (i.e., semantic similarity). Soft matching is achieved by leveraging a lightweight sentence embedding model to quantify semantic similarity, thereby mitigating excessive computational burden and intrinsic bias-associated limitations of self-evaluation. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves substantial gains in computational efficiency and overall better performance than self-evaluation methods across diverse model architectures and tasks.",

This behavior poses significant challenges for multi-agent debating systems (MADS) that rely on productive disagreement to refine arguments and foster innovative thinking. LLMs' inherent sycophancy can collapse debates into premature consensus, potentially undermining the benefits of multi-agent debate. While prior studies focus on user--LLM sycophancy, the impact of inter-agent sycophancy in debate remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce the first operational framework that (1) proposes a formal definition of sycophancy specific to MADS settings, (2) develops new metrics to evaluate the agent sycophancy level and its impact on information exchange in MADS, and (3) systematically investigates how varying levels of sycophancy across agent roles (debaters and judges) affects outcomes in both decentralized and centralized debate frameworks. Our findings reveal that sycophancy is a core failure mode that amplifies disagreement collapse before reaching a correct conclusion in multi-agent debates, yields lower accuracy than single-agent baselines, and arises from distinct debater-driven and judge-driven failure modes. Building on these findings, we propose actionable design principles for MADS, effectively balancing productive disagreement with cooperation in agent interactions.",

        "summary": "This article presents two corpora of English and Czech texts generated with large language models (LLMs). The motivation is to create a resource for comparing human-written texts with LLM-generated text linguistically. Emphasis was placed on ensuring these resources are multi-genre and rich in terms of topics, authors, and text types, while maintaining comparability with existing human-created corpora. These generated corpora replicate reference human corpora: BE21 by Paul Baker, which is a modern version of the original Brown Corpus, and Koditex corpus that also follows the Brown Corpus tradition but in Czech. The new corpora were generated using models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Alphabet, Meta, and DeepSeek, ranging from GPT-3 (davinci-002) to GPT-4.5, and are tagged according to the Universal Dependencies standard (i.e., they are tokenized, lemmatized, and morphologically and syntactically annotated). The subcorpus size varies according to the model used (the English part contains on average 864k tokens per model, 27M tokens altogether, the Czech partcontains on average 768k tokens per model, 21.5M tokens altogether). The corpora are freely available for download under the CC BY 4.0 license (the annotated data are under CC BY-NC-SA 4.0 licence) and are also accessible through the search interface of the Czech National Corpus.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically examine LLM capabilities in biography, a critical yet underexplored dimension of factual knowledge. At its core, AdamDB is a multilingual and multimodal dataset covering over 4 million individuals across geography, time, and profession, while AdamBench provides cognitively structured evaluations based on Bloom's taxonomy, spanning six reasoning levels in both English and native languages. To address hallucinations, particularly for lesser-known individuals, we propose AdamRAG, a retrieval-augmented generation system tailored to biographical contexts. Experiments show that AdamRAG substantially improves open-source models and modestly benefits closed-source ones, with the largest gains on lower-order reasoning. Popularity strongly mediates accuracy, and multimodal input via face images offers smaller, less consistent improvements than retrieval. ADAM establishes the first benchmark and framework for cognitively, culturally, and multimodally grounded biographical evaluation, advancing the development of multilingual, accurate, and hallucination-resistant MLLMs.",

However, existing benchmarks are tied to fixed data formats and have not systematically examined how representation itself affects model performance. We present the first controlled study that isolates the role of table representation by holding content constant while varying structure. Using a verbalization pipeline, we generate paired structured and semi-structured tables, enabling direct comparisons across modeling paradigms. To support detailed analysis, we introduce a diagnostic benchmark with splits along table size, join requirements, query complexity, and schema quality. Our experiments reveal consistent trade-offs: SQL-based methods achieve high accuracy on structured inputs but degrade on semi-structured data, LLMs exhibit flexibility but reduced precision, and hybrid approaches strike a balance, particularly under noisy schemas. These effects intensify with larger tables and more complex queries. Ultimately, no single method excels across all conditions, and we highlight the central role of representation in shaping Table QA performance. Our findings provide actionable insights for model selection and design, paving the way for more robust hybrid approaches suited for diverse real-world data formats.",

However, we do not understand the types of linguistic representations these models use to accomplish this task. To address this question, we study how S3M variants optimized for word recognition represent phonological and morphological phenomena in frequent English noun and verb inflections. We find that their representations exhibit a global linear geometry which can be used to link English nouns and verbs to their regular inflected forms. This geometric structure does not directly track phonological or morphological units. Instead, it tracks the regular distributional relationships linking many word pairs in the English lexicon -- often, but not always, due to morphological inflection. These findings point to candidate representational strategies that may support human spoken word recognition, challenging the presumed necessity of distinct linguistic representations of phonology and morphology.",

        "summary": "Does explicitly exercising the induction circuit during pretraining improve in-context learning (ICL), or is natural text sufficient when compute is held constant (iso-FLOPs)? To test whether targeted synthetic data can accelerate induction-head emergence and enhance ICL, we introduce Bi-Induct, a lightweight curriculum that injects forward-copy (Induction), backward-copy (Anti), or a balanced mix into the pretraining stream. We train models from 0.13B to 1B parameters under iso-FLOPs, evaluating (i) few-shot ICL benchmarks, (ii) head-level telemetry, and (iii) held-out language modeling perplexity. Our findings challenge the assumption that early induction circuit activation directly improves ICL. While Bi-Induct accelerates induction-head emergence at small scales, this does not consistently yield stronger generalization. On standard LM benchmarks, Bi-Induct matches natural-only training; on function-style ICL probes, the 1B natural-only performs best. Stress tests (e.g., label permutation, HITS@1 vs. HITS@3, 1 vs. 10 shots) preserve these trends. Telemetry shows larger natural-only models develop broader, earlier induction heads without explicit induction patterns. Anti-induction data fails to elicit meaningful activation. Perplexity penalties from synthetic data shrink with scale, suggesting larger models can absorb non-natural patterns with minimal cost. Crucially, ablating the top 2% of induction heads degrades ICL more than random ablations, especially for natural-only models, indicating more centralized, load-bearing circuits. Bi-Induct variants exhibit more redundant induction activity, implying different circuit utilization. Overall, inducing activation is not sufficient: ICL gains depend on these circuits becoming functionally necessary. These results underscore mechanism-aware pretraining diagnostics and data mixtures that foster load-bearing, not merely present, structure.",

This capability is especially powerful for storytelling, where visual illustrations can illuminate a story originally expressed in text. In this paper, we focus on the task of narrative scene illustration, which involves automatically generating an image depicting a scene in a story. Motivated by recent progress on text-to-image models, we consider a pipeline that uses LLMs as an interface for prompting text-to-image models to generate scene illustrations given raw story text. We apply variations of this pipeline to a prominent story corpus in order to synthesize illustrations for scenes in these stories. We conduct a human annotation task to obtain pairwise quality judgments for these illustrations. The outcome of this process is the SceneIllustrations dataset, which we release as a new resource for future work on cross-modal narrative transformation. Through our analysis of this dataset and experiments modeling illustration quality, we demonstrate that LLMs can effectively verbalize scene knowledge implicitly evoked by story text. Moreover, this capability is impactful for generating and evaluating illustrations.",

        "summary": "Background: Large language models (LLMs) can be useful in diagnosing medical conditions, but few studies have evaluated their consistency in recommending appropriate medication regimens. The purpose of this evaluation was to test GPT-4o on three medication benchmarking tests including mapping a drug name to its correct formulation, identifying drug-drug interactions using both its internal knowledge and using a web search, and preparing a medication order sentence after being given the medication name. Methods: Using GTP-4o three experiments were completed. Accuracy was quantified by computing cosine similarity on TF-IDF vectors, normalized Levenshtein similarity, and ROUGE-1/ROUGE-L F1 between each response and its reference string or by manual evaluation by clinicians. Results: GPT-4o performed poorly on drug-formulation matching, with frequent omissions of available drug formulations (mean 1.23 per medication) and hallucinations of formulations that do not exist (mean 1.14 per medication). Only 49% of tested medications were correctly matched to all available formulations. Accuracy was decreased for medications with more formulations (p<0.0001). GPT-4o was also inconsistent at identifying drug-drug-interactions, although it had better performance with the search-augmented assessment compared to its internal knowledge (54.7% vs. 69.2%, p=0.013). However, allowing a web-search worsened performance when there was no drug-drug interaction (median % correct 100% vs. 40%, p<0.001). Finally, GPT-4o performed moderately with preparing a medication order sentence, with only 65.8% of medication order sentences containing no medication or abbreviation errors. Conclusions: Model performance was overall poor for all tests. This highlights the need for domain-specific training through clinician-annotated datasets and a comprehensive evaluation framework for benchmarking performance.",

After showing that simply prompting models to generate mental states between dialogue turns already provides significant benefit, we further introduce ToMAgent (ToMA), a ToM-focused dialogue agent. ToMA is trained by pairing ToM with dialogue lookahead to produce mental states that are maximally useful for achieving dialogue goals. Experiments on the Sotopia interactive social evaluation benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our method over a range of baselines. Comprehensive analysis shows that ToMA exhibits more strategic, goal-oriented reasoning behaviors, which enable long-horizon adaptation, while maintaining better relationships with their partners.

However, current strategies such as self-reflection primarily focus on logical or structural refinement. They do not leverage the guiding potential of affective feedback. Inspired by psychological research showing that emotions can modulate cognitive performance, we introduce HEART--a novel framework that uses emotionally-driven prompts for iterative self-correction. HEART provides feedback on a model's incorrect response using a curated set of concise, emotionally charged phrases based on the six universal emotions categorized by Dr. Paul Ekman. By systematically varying the emotional tone of the feedback across iterations, our method guides the model to escape flawed reasoning paths and explore more promising alternatives. We evaluate our framework on challenging reasoning benchmarks including OlympiadBench, Humanity's Last Exam, and SimpleQA. Our results reveal a significant new phenomenon: when guided by an oracle verifier, this affective iteration protocol unlocks significantly deeper reasoning, leading to consistent and substantial increases in accuracy over state-of-the-art baselines with the same verifier. However, we also identify a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. In a verifier-free setting, it struggles to harness these gains consistently, highlighting as a key challenge for future work. Our findings suggest that the next frontier in machine reasoning may lie not just in refining logic, but also in understanding and leveraging the `HEART' of the models.",

Sentence nodes are enriched with features from the SAMER lexicon as well as contextual embeddings from the Arabic transformer model. The graph neural network (GNN) and transformer sentence encoder are trained as two independent branches, and their predictions are combined via late fusion at inference. For document-level prediction, sentence-level outputs are aggregated using max pooling to reflect the most difficult sentence. Experimental results show that this hybrid method outperforms standalone GNN or transformer branches across multiple readability metrics. Overall, the findings highlight that fusion offers advantages at the document level, but the GNN-only approach remains stronger for precise prediction of sentence-level readability.",

Extensively studied in the field of psychology, cognitive biases appear as systematic distortions commonly observed in human judgments. This paper presents a large-scale evaluation of eight well-established cognitive biases across 45 LLMs, analyzing over 2.8 million LLM responses generated through controlled prompt variations. To achieve this, we introduce a novel evaluation framework based on multiple-choice tasks, hand-curate a dataset of 220 decision scenarios targeting fundamental cognitive biases in collaboration with psychologists, and propose a scalable approach for generating diverse prompts from human-authored scenario templates. Our analysis shows that LLMs exhibit bias-consistent behavior in 17.8-57.3% of instances across a range of judgment and decision-making contexts targeting anchoring, availability, confirmation, framing, interpretation, overattribution, prospect theory, and representativeness biases. We find that both model size and prompt specificity play a significant role on bias susceptibility as follows: larger size (>32B parameters) can reduce bias in 39.5% of cases, while higher prompt detail reduces most biases by up to 14.9%, except in one case (Overattribution), which is exacerbated by up to 8.8%.",

However, existing approaches largely rely on injecting shift vectors into residual flows, which are typically constructed from labeled demonstrations or task-specific alignment. Such designs fall short of utilizing the structural mechanisms underlying ICL and suffer from limited generalizability. To address this, we propose In-Context Routing (ICR), a novel implicit ICL method that internalizes generalizable ICL patterns at the attention logits level. It extracts reusable structural directions that emerge during ICL and employs a learnable input-conditioned router to modulate attention logits accordingly, enabling a train-once-and-reuse framework. We evaluate ICR on 12 real-world datasets spanning diverse domains and multiple LLMs. The results show that ICR consistently outperforms prior implicit ICL methods that require task-specific retrieval or training, while demonstrating robust generalization to out-of-domain tasks where existing methods struggle. These findings position ICR to push the boundary of ICL's practical value.",

Actually, different parts of the context and knowledge are differentially important for recognizing the proper response candidate, as many utterances are useless due to the topic shift.

        "summary": "The growing deployment of large language model (LLM) based agents that interact with external environments has created new attack surfaces for adversarial manipulation. One major threat is indirect prompt injection, where attackers embed malicious instructions in external environment output, causing agents to interpret and execute them as if they were legitimate prompts. While previous research has focused primarily on plain-text injection attacks, we find a significant yet underexplored vulnerability: LLMs' dependence on structured chat templates and their susceptibility to contextual manipulation through persuasive multi-turn dialogues. To this end, we introduce ChatInject, an attack that formats malicious payloads to mimic native chat templates, thereby exploiting the model's inherent instruction-following tendencies. Building on this foundation, we develop a persuasion-driven Multi-turn variant that primes the agent across conversational turns to accept and execute otherwise suspicious actions. Through comprehensive experiments across frontier LLMs, we demonstrate three critical findings: (1) ChatInject achieves significantly higher average attack success rates than traditional prompt injection methods, improving from 5.18% to 32.05% on AgentDojo and from 15.13% to 45.90% on InjecAgent, with multi-turn dialogues showing particularly strong performance at average 52.33% success rate on InjecAgent, (2) chat-template-based payloads demonstrate strong transferability across models and remain effective even against closed-source LLMs, despite their unknown template structures, and (3) existing prompt-based defenses are largely ineffective against this attack approach, especially against Multi-turn variants.

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a popular training paradigm, particularly when paired with reasoning models. While effective, it primarily focuses on generating responses and lacks mechanisms to explicitly foster critique or reflection. Several recent studies, like Critique-Fine-Tuning (CFT) and Critique-Guided-Distillation (CGD) have shown the benefits of explicitly teaching LLMs how to critique. Motivated by them, we propose Critique Reinforcement Learning (CRL), where the model is tasked with generating a critique for a given (question, solution) pair. The reward is determined solely by whether the final judgment label $c \\in \\{\\texttt{True}, \\texttt{False}\\}$ of the generated critique aligns with the ground-truth judgment $c^*$. Building on this point, we introduce \\textsc{Critique-Coder}, which is trained on a hybrid of RL and CRL by substituting 20\\% of the standard RL data with CRL data. We fine-tune multiple models (\\textsc{Critique-Coder}) and evaluate them on different benchmarks to show their advantages over RL-only models. We show that \\textsc{Critique-Coder} consistently outperforms RL-only baselines on all the evaluated benchmarks. Notably, our \\textsc{Critique-Coder-8B} can reach over 60\\% on LiveCodeBench (v5), outperforming other reasoning models like DeepCoder-14B and GPT-o1. Beyond code generation, \\textsc{Critique-Coder} also demonstrates enhanced general reasoning abilities, as evidenced by its better performance on logic reasoning tasks from the BBEH dataset. This indicates that the application of CRL on coding datasets enhances general reasoning and critique abilities, which are transferable across a broad range of tasks. Hence, we believe that CRL works as a great complement to standard RL for LLM reasoning.",

EditGRPO integrates on-policy exploration with off-policy guidance by injecting sentence-level detailed corrections during training rollouts. This mixed-policy approach addresses the exploration dilemma and sampling efficiency issues typically encountered in RL.

To evaluate the difficulty of the synthesized audio from each model and determine which produces the most challenging samples, we aimed to guide the construction of our final dataset either by merging audios from multiple models or by selecting the best-performing model, we conducted an evaluation pipeline that included training classifiers using two approaches: modern embedding-based methods combined with classifier heads; classical machine learning algorithms applied to MFCC features; and the RawNet2 architecture. The pipeline further incorporated the calculation of Mean Opinion Score based on human ratings, as well as processing both original and synthesized datasets through an Automatic Speech Recognition model to measure the Word Error Rate. Our results demonstrate that FishSpeech outperforms other TTS models in Arabic voice cloning on the Casablanca corpus, producing more realistic and challenging synthetic speech samples.

        "summary": "Real-world Multi-hop Question Answering (QA) often involves ambiguity that is inseparable from the reasoning process itself. This ambiguity creates a distinct challenge, where multiple reasoning paths emerge from a single question, each requiring independent resolution. Since each sub-question is ambiguous, the model must resolve ambiguity at every step. Thus, answering a single question requires handling multiple layers of ambiguity throughout the reasoning chain. We find that current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle in this setting, typically exploring wrong reasoning paths and producing incomplete answers. To facilitate research on multi-hop ambiguity, we introduce MultI-hop Reasoning with AmbiGuity Evaluation for Illusory Questions (MIRAGE), a benchmark designed to analyze and evaluate this challenging intersection of ambiguity interpretation and multi-hop reasoning. MIRAGE contains 1,142 high-quality examples of ambiguous multi-hop questions, categorized under a taxonomy of syntactic, general, and semantic ambiguity, and curated through a rigorous multi-LLM verification pipeline. Our experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art models struggle on MIRAGE, confirming that resolving ambiguity combined with multi-step inference is a distinct and significant challenge. To establish a robust baseline, we propose CLarifying Ambiguity with a Reasoning and InstructiON (CLARION), a multi-agent framework that significantly outperforms existing approaches on MIRAGE, paving the way for more adaptive and robust reasoning systems.",

        "summary": "Language models (LMs) are typically post-trained for desired capabilities and behaviors via weight-based or prompt-based steering, but the former is time-consuming and expensive, and the latter is not precisely controllable and often requires manual trial-and-error. While activation steering (AS) promises a cheap, fast, and controllable alternative to the two existing post-training methods, current AS techniques require hand-crafted prompt pairs or labor-intensive feature annotation, making them more inconvenient than the plug-and-play methods such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We introduce Painless Activation Steering (PAS), a family of fully automated methods that make AS readily usable with any given labeled dataset, with no need for prompt construction, feature labeling, or human intervention. We evaluate PAS on three open-weight models (Llama3.1-8B-Instruct, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-8B, and Nous-Hermes-2) and 18 tasks; we find that PAS reliably improves performance for behavior tasks, but not for intelligence-oriented tasks. The introspective variant (iPAS) delivers the strongest causal steering effects (10.1% on Bias, 5.2% on Morality, and 34.8% on Alignment). We also show PAS delivers additional gains on top of In-Context Learning (ICL) and SFT. PAS constructs a fast, lightweight activation vector that can be cheaply trained, easily stored, and activated at will. Our results provide a characterization of where AS helps, where it fails, and how to deploy it as a practical, automated LM post-training option.",

        "summary": "In autoregressive language models, each token is sampled by conditioning on all the past tokens; the overall string has thus been sampled from the correct underlying joint distribution represented by the model. In contrast, masked diffusion language models generate text by unmasking tokens out of order and potentially in parallel. Generating an overall string sampled from the correct underlying joint distribution would (again) require exactly one token unmasking in every full-model forward pass. The more tokens unmasked in parallel, the further away the string is from the true joint; this can be seen in the resulting drop in accuracy (but, increase in speed). In this paper we devise a way to {\\em approximately} sample multiple tokens from the joint distribution in a single full-model forward pass; we do so by developing a new lightweight single-layer ``sampler\" on top of an existing large diffusion LM. One forward pass of the full model can now be followed by multiple forward passes of only this sampler layer, to yield multiple unmasked tokens. Our sampler is trained to mimic exact joint sampling from the (frozen) full model. We show the effectiveness of our approximate joint sampling for both pretrained-only (Dream-7B-Base) and instruction-tuned (Dream-7B-Instruct) models on language modeling and math \\& coding tasks. When four tokens are unmasked for each full-model denoising step, our sampling algorithm achieves a MAUVE score of 0.87 (vs marginal baseline of 0.31) with respect to the true joint distribution.",

This approach overlooks non-verbal cues such as vocal tone and prosody that are essential for capturing true emotional intent. We introduce Dynamic Attention Fusion (DAF), a lightweight framework that combines frozen text embeddings from a pretrained language model with acoustic features from a speech encoder, using an adaptive attention mechanism to weight each modality per utterance. Without any finetuning of the underlying encoders, our proposed DAF model consistently outperforms both static fusion and unimodal baselines on a large multimodal benchmark. We report notable gains in F1-score and reductions in prediction error and perform a variety of ablation studies that support our hypothesis that the dynamic weighting strategy is crucial for modeling emotionally complex inputs. By effectively integrating verbal and non-verbal information, our approach offers a more robust foundation for sentiment prediction and carries broader impact for affective computing applications -- from emotion recognition and mental health assessment to more natural human computer interaction.",

TRUEBench distinguishes itself by featuring input prompts across 12 languages, incorporating intra-instance multilingual instructions, employing rigorous evaluation criteria to capture both explicit and implicit constraints, and including complex multi-turn dialogue scenarios with both accumulating constraints and context switches. Furthermore, to ensure reliability in evaluation, we refined constraints using an LLM validator. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TRUEBench presents significantly greater challenges than existing benchmarks; for instance, a strong model like OpenAI o1 achieved only a 69.07% overall pass rate. TRUEBench offers a demanding and realistic assessment of LLMs in practical productivity settings, highlighting their capabilities and limitations.",

These effects show notable variation by domain and disability type, with disabilities affecting hearing, speech, and mobility disproportionately impacted. These disparities reflect persistent forms of ableism embedded in model behavior.

In this work, we present an unsupervised approach that benchmarks models on the basis of their uncertainty in classifying messages annotated by people belonging to vulnerable groups. We use uncertainty, computed by means of the conformal prediction technique, as a proxy to analyze the bias of 11 models against women and non-white annotators and observe to what extent it diverges from metrics based on performance, such as the $F_1$ score. The results show that some pre-trained models predict with high accuracy the labels coming from minority groups, even if the confidence in their prediction is low.

        "summary": "We introduce SIRI, Scaling Iterative Reinforcement Learning with Interleaved Compression, a simple yet effective RL approach for Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) that enables more efficient and accurate reasoning. Existing studies have observed repetitive thinking patterns in LRMs, and attempts to reduce them often come at the cost of performance. In this paper, we show that this trade-off can be overcome through a training regime that iteratively alternates between compressing and expanding the reasoning budget, by dynamically adjusting the maximum rollout length during training. The compression phase cuts the rollout length, forcing the model to make precise and valuable decisions within a limited context, which effectively reduces redundant tokens and increases reasoning density. The expansion phase then relaxes the length limit, providing space for the model to explore and plan in long-horizon settings. Remarkably, we find that after each compression-expansion cycle, the model's performance improves even as its output length decreases, steadily pushing it closer to the Pareto frontier in the performance-efficiency trade-off. Training on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, SIRI-low improves performance on AIME24 by 43.2% while reducing token usage by 46.9% after three iterations, and SIRI-high achieves the highest accuracy compared to all other methods (Figure 1). Our findings shed light on the potential of periodically oscillating the LRM's output truncation length during training to dynamically balance exploration and efficiency in reasoning, converging towards an optimal \"sweet spot\" between the two.

Among these tasks, reasoning is particularly representative, with mathematical reasoning serving as a prominent example. It highlights the high-level capability of VLMs to comprehend mathematical information in images and to perform sophisticated reasoning. Recently, numerous visual mathematical reasoning benchmarks have been proposed, but they are often restricted to geometry, lack coverage of math word problems, and rarely assess reasoning across multiple images. To address these gaps, we introduce GSM8K-V, a purely visual multi-image mathematical reasoning benchmark. GSM8K-V is built by systematically mapping each sample from the widely used text-based GSM8K into visual form. Through a carefully designed automated image-generation pipeline combined with meticulous human annotation, we curate 1,319 high-quality samples. We evaluate a wide range of open-source and closed-source models on GSM8K-V. Results show that although existing VLMs have nearly saturated performance on text-based GSM8K, there remains substantial room for improvement on GSM8K-V. For example, the best-performing model, Gemini-2.5-Pro, achieves 95.22% accuracy on GSM8K but only 46.93% on GSM8K-V. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of GSM8K-V, examining the limitations of current models as well as potential directions for improvement. GSM8K-V offers a new perspective on visual mathematical reasoning and establishes a benchmark to guide the development of more robust and generalizable VLMs.",

        "summary": "Existing medical reasoning benchmarks for vision-language models primarily focus on analyzing a patient's condition based on an image from a single visit. However, this setting deviates significantly from real-world clinical practice, where doctors typically refer to a patient's historical conditions to provide a comprehensive assessment by tracking their changes over time. In this paper, we introduce TemMed-Bench, the first benchmark designed for analyzing changes in patients' conditions between different clinical visits, which challenges large vision-language models (LVLMs) to reason over temporal medical images. TemMed-Bench consists of a test set comprising three tasks - visual question-answering (VQA), report generation, and image-pair selection - and a supplementary knowledge corpus of over 17,000 instances. With TemMed-Bench, we conduct an evaluation of six proprietary and six open-source LVLMs. Our results show that most LVLMs lack the ability to analyze patients' condition changes over temporal medical images, and a large proportion perform only at a random-guessing level in the closed-book setting. In contrast, GPT o3, o4-mini and Claude 3.5 Sonnet demonstrate comparatively decent performance, though they have yet to reach the desired level. Furthermore, we explore augmenting the input with both retrieved visual and textual modalities in the medical domain. We also show that multi-modal retrieval augmentation yields notably higher performance gains than no retrieval and textual retrieval alone across most models on our benchmark, with the VQA task showing an average improvement of 2.59%. Overall, we compose a benchmark grounded on real-world clinical practice, and it reveals LVLMs' limitations in temporal medical image reasoning, as well as highlighting the use of multi-modal retrieval augmentation as a potentially promising direction worth exploring to address this challenge.",

        "summary": "With the growing adoption of large language model agents in persistent real-world roles, they naturally encounter continuous streams of tasks. A key limitation, however, is their failure to learn from the accumulated interaction history, forcing them to discard valuable insights and repeat past errors. We propose ReasoningBank, a novel memory framework that distills generalizable reasoning strategies from an agent's self-judged successful and failed experiences. At test time, an agent retrieves relevant memories from ReasoningBank to inform its interaction and then integrates new learnings back, enabling it to become more capable over time. Building on this powerful experience learner, we further introduce memory-aware test-time scaling (MaTTS), which accelerates and diversifies this learning process by scaling up the agent's interaction experience. By allocating more compute to each task, the agent generates abundant, diverse experiences that provide rich contrastive signals for synthesizing higher-quality memory. The better memory in turn guides more effective scaling, establishing a powerful synergy between memory and test-time scaling. Across web browsing and software engineering benchmarks, ReasoningBank consistently outperforms existing memory mechanisms that store raw trajectories or only successful task routines, improving both effectiveness and efficiency; MaTTS further amplifies these gains. These findings establish memory-driven experience scaling as a new scaling dimension, enabling agents to self-evolve with emergent behaviors naturally arise.",

However, it suffers from a critical issue: entropy collapse and premature convergence. Naive entropy regularization, a common approach for encouraging exploration in the traditional RL literature, fails to address this problem in the context of LRM. Our analysis reveals that this failure stems from the vast action space and long trajectories in LRMs, which easily trigger a global entropy explosion as the model indiscriminately explores all possible actions and states. To address this, we propose SIREN (SelectIve entRopy rEgularizatioN), a method that confines exploration to a meaningful subset of actions and states. SIREN achieves this through a two-step entropy masking mechanism, consisting of a top-p mask and a peak-entropy mask. In addition, regularization is transformed into a self-anchored form to stabilize training. Across five mathematical benchmarks, SIREN attains superior average performance over previous entropy-related RLVR approaches, exemplified by a +6.6 maj@k improvement on AIME24/25 with Qwen2.5-Math-7B. Further analysis confirms that SIREN promotes greater response diversity and maintains entropy at an appropriate level, which helps to preserve the validation pass@k throughout training.

This design enables efficient cross-modal interaction and low-latency, streaming speech generation. For understanding, a unified training strategy coupled with a dual audio encoder design enables long-form audio perception across diverse acoustic conditions. For generation, a chunk-based parallel decoding scheme narrows the text speech token-rate gap, accelerating inference and supporting streaming zero-shot voice cloning with stable timbre over extended durations. Compared to concurrent work, MGM-Omni achieves these capabilities with markedly data-efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGM-Omni outperforms existing open source models in preserving timbre identity across extended sequences, producing natural and context-aware speech, and achieving superior long-form audio and omnimodal understanding.

        "summary": "Does RL teach LLMs genuinely new skills, or does it merely activate existing ones? This question lies at the core of ongoing debates about the role of RL in LLM post-training. On one side, strong empirical results can be achieved with RL even without preceding supervised finetuning; on the other, critics argue that RL contributes little beyond reweighting existing reasoning strategies. This work provides concrete evidence that LLMs can acquire genuinely new skills during RL by composing existing ones, mirroring one of the central mechanisms by which humans acquire new cognitive skills. To mitigate data contamination and other confounding factors, and to allow precise control over task complexity, we develop a synthetic framework for our investigation. Specifically, we define a skill as the ability to infer the output of a string transformation function f(x) given x. When an LLM has already learned f and g prior to RL, our experiments reveal that RL enables it to learn unseen compositions of them h(x)=g(f(x)). Further, this compositional ability generalizes to more difficult problems such as compositions of >2 functions unseen during RL training. Surprisingly, our experiments show that compositional skill acquired on a source task transfers to a different target task. This transfer happens even without compositional training on the target, requiring only prior knowledge of the target's atomic skills. Our qualitative analysis shows that RL fundamentally changes the reasoning behaviors of the models. In contrast, next-token training with the same data yields none of these findings. Our systematic experiments provide fresh insights into LLM learning, suggesting the value of first building base models with basic skills, then using RL to incentivize advanced, generalizable skills for complex problems.",

What remains unclear is whether this phenomenon holds for LLM families trained under *practical scaling recipes*, where width, depth, learning rate, batch size, and weight decay are scaled jointly. We show that it does: loss curves collapse across scales precisely when optimization hyperparameters are set optimally for the given data budget, in accordance with recent empirical scaling laws. Collapse thus emerges as a signature of compute-efficient training. We demonstrate two applications at scale: (1) deviation-from-collapse provides a sensitive, early diagnostic of training pathologies, and (2) the predictability of collapsed curves enables early stopping in large-scale hyperparameter tuning. Finally, we train a competitive LLM family, *Celerity*, using these insights, highlighting collapse as an effective tool for developing efficient LLMs.",

Recent work explores using large language models (LLMs) to simulate respondents via persona-based prompts, often without labeled data. We study a more practical setting where partial survey responses exist: we fine-tune LLMs on available data to impute self-reported vote choice under both random and systematic nonresponse, using the German Longitudinal Election Study. We compare zero-shot prompting and supervised fine-tuning against tabular classifiers (e.g., CatBoost) and test how different convenience samples (e.g., students) used for fine-tuning affect generalization. Our results show that when data are missing completely at random, fine-tuned LLMs match tabular classifiers but outperform zero-shot approaches. When only biased convenience samples are available, fine-tuning small (3B to 8B) open-source LLMs can recover both individual-level predictions and population-level distributions more accurately than zero-shot and often better than tabular methods. This suggests fine-tuned LLMs offer a promising strategy for researchers working with non-probability samples or systematic missingness, and may enable new survey designs requiring only easily accessible subpopulations.",

        "summary": "Software development relies heavily on extensive unit testing, which makes the efficiency of automated Unit Test Generation (UTG) particularly important. However, most existing LLMs generate test cases one token at a time in each forward pass, which leads to inefficient UTG. Recently, diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have emerged, offering promising parallel generation capabilities and showing strong potential for efficient UTG. Despite this advantage, their application to UTG is still constrained by a clear trade-off between efficiency and test quality, since increasing the number of tokens generated in each step often causes a sharp decline in the quality of test cases. To overcome this limitation, we present DiffTester, an acceleration framework specifically tailored for dLLMs in UTG. The key idea of DiffTester is that unit tests targeting the same focal method often share repetitive structural patterns. By dynamically identifying these common patterns through abstract syntax tree analysis during generation, DiffTester adaptively increases the number of tokens produced at each step without compromising the quality of the output. To enable comprehensive evaluation, we extend the original TestEval benchmark, which was limited to Python, by introducing additional programming languages including Java and C++. Extensive experiments on three benchmarks with two representative models show that DiffTester delivers significant acceleration while preserving test coverage. Moreover, DiffTester generalizes well across different dLLMs and programming languages, providing a practical and scalable solution for efficient UTG in software development.

Recent work has sought to enhance this capability via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or reinforcement learning (RL), improving regret on the classic multi-armed bandit task. However, it remains unclear how these learning methods shape exploration strategies and how well they generalize. We investigate both paradigms by training LLMs with SFT on expert trajectories and RL with a range of tailored reward signals including a strategic, regret-shaped reward to reduce variance, and an algorithmic reward that enables oracle imitation. The resulting agents outperform pre-trained models and achieve performance comparable to Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, with robust generalization to 6x longer horizons and across bandit families. Behavioral analysis reveals that gains often stem from more sophisticated but greedier exploitation: RL/SFT agents are more prone to early catastrophic failure than pre-trained models, prematurely abandoning exploration. Furthermore, agents trained to imitate UCB learn to outperform their teacher by adopting more exploitative variants. Our findings clarify when each training paradigm is preferable and advocate tailored reward design and evaluation beyond average regret to promote robust exploratory behavior.",

Despite recent progress in reasoning-enhanced IR, existing approaches still face significant challenges in applicability, scalability, and efficiency. In this work, we propose Retro*, a novel approach for reasoning-intensive document retrieval. Our method introduces a rubric-based relevance scoring mechanism, enabling the model to reason about the relationship between a task and a document based on explicitly defined criteria, whereby producing a fine-grained, interpretable relevance score. Retro* also supports test-time scaling by combining multiple reasoning trajectories via score integration, which produces more reliable relevance estimates. To optimize Retro*'s reasoning capabilities, we introduce a novel reinforcement learning algorithm tailored for its relevance scoring mechanism, which employs two composite rewards to fully exploit the trajectories of each training sample.

However, most existing approaches focus on transforming data formats while neglecting the internal reasoning complexity of training samples, leaving the reasoning potential of data under-explored and underutilized. In this work, we posit that LLM logical reasoning performance is jointly constrained by the potential of the training data and the cognitive capacity of the model. To make this relationship measurable, we introduce Data Reasoning Intensity (DRI), a novel metric that quantifies the latent logical reasoning complexity of samples by decomposing and aggregating their logical structures. This allows us to analyze how well current LLMs utilize logical reasoning signals and identify performance gaps relative to data potential. Based on this insight, we introduce a re-cognizing optimization strategy that systematically enhances the logical reasoning intensity of training data.Rather than increasing data volume, our method re-optimizes existing samples to better align with the LLM's logical reasoning boundary. Extensive experiments show that our approach significantly improves performance and generalization over data-centric strategies. We further validate our method under a reinforcement learning framework. Our results indicate that prioritizing reasoning complexity in data rather than sheer scale or superficial form is essential to realizing LLMs' full cognitive potential.",

        "summary": "Video-conditioned sound and speech generation, encompassing video-to-sound (V2S) and visual text-to-speech (VisualTTS) tasks, are conventionally addressed as separate tasks, with limited exploration to unify them within a signle framework. Recent attempts to unify V2S and VisualTTS face challenges in handling distinct condition types (e.g., heterogeneous video and transcript conditions) and require complex training stages. Unifying these two tasks remains an open problem. To bridge this gap, we present VSSFlow, which seamlessly integrates both V2S and VisualTTS tasks into a unified flow-matching framework. VSSFlow uses a novel condition aggregation mechanism to handle distinct input signals. We find that cross-attention and self-attention layer exhibit different inductive biases in the process of introducing condition. Therefore, VSSFlow leverages these inductive biases to effectively handle different representations: cross-attention for ambiguous video conditions and self-attention for more deterministic speech transcripts. Furthermore, contrary to the prevailing belief that joint training on the two tasks requires complex training strategies and may degrade performance, we find that VSSFlow benefits from the end-to-end joint learning process for sound and speech generation without extra designs on training stages. Detailed analysis attributes it to the learned general audio prior shared between tasks, which accelerates convergence, enhances conditional generation, and stabilizes the classifier-free guidance process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VSSFlow surpasses the state-of-the-art domain-specific baselines on both V2S and VisualTTS benchmarks, underscoring the critical potential of unified generative models.",

        "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have shown impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics, yet they also display misbehaviors that expose their limitations. In particular, when faced with hard questions, LRMs often engage in unproductive reasoning until context limit, producing wrong answers while wasting substantial computation. This phenomenon reflects a fundamental issue: current answering paradigms overlook the relationship between questions and LRMs' capability boundaries. In this paper, we investigate whether LRMs possess self-awareness of capability boundaries. We begin by an observation that LRMs may know what they cannot solve through expressed reasoning confidence. For black-box models, we find that reasoning expressions reveal boundary signals, with accelerated growing confidence trajectory for solvable problems but convergent uncertainty trajectory for unsolvable ones. For white-box models, we show that hidden states of the last input token encode boundary information, with solvable and unsolvable problems linearly separable even before reasoning begins. Building on these findings, we propose two simple yet effective optimization strategies: reasoning expression monitoring and hidden states monitoring. Experiments demonstrate that these boundary-aware strategies enable LRMs to avoid unproductive reasoning without sacrificing accuracy, significantly improving reliability and efficiency by cutting token usage up to 62.7 - 93.6%.",

        "summary": "Large language model (LLM) alignment faces a critical dilemma when addressing multiple human preferences: improvements in one dimension frequently come at the expense of others, creating unavoidable trade-offs between competing objectives like helpfulness and harmlessness. While prior work mainly focuses on constraint-based optimization algorithms and data selection strategies to mitigate conflicts, these approaches overlook the fundamental issue of resolving conflicts directly at the parameter level. In this paper, we present OrthAlign, an innovative approach that pioneers a new paradigm by leveraging orthogonal subspace decomposition to fundamentally resolve gradient-level conflicts in multi-objective preference alignment. OrthAlign strategically decomposes parameter update spaces into orthogonal subspaces, ensuring that optimization toward different preferences occurs in mathematically non-interfering directions. Building upon this, we provide theoretical guarantees demonstrating that when parameter increments satisfy both orthogonal subspace constraints and spectral norm bounds, the resulting updates exhibit linear Lipschitz growth rather than exponential instability, ensuring stable convergence across all preference dimensions. Extensive experiments show that: I. OrthAlign achieves maximum single-preference improvements ranging from 34.61% to 50.89% after multiple-objective alignment across helpful, harmless, and truthful dimensions. II. With an average overall reward improvement of 13.96%.",

Existing approaches often suffer from severe forgetting due to the full fine-tuning of a shared base model, which leads to knowledge interference between tasks. Moreover, they frequently rely on data augmentation strategies that can introduce unnatural or semantically distorted inputs. To address these limitations, we propose LEAF, a novel and robust expert-based framework for FCED. LEAF integrates a specialized mixture of experts architecture into the base model, where each expert is parameterized with low-rank adaptation (LoRA) matrices. A semantic-aware expert selection mechanism dynamically routes instances to the most relevant experts, enabling expert specialization and reducing knowledge interference. To improve generalization in limited-data settings, LEAF incorporates a contrastive learning objective guided by label descriptions, which capture high-level semantic information about event types. Furthermore, to prevent overfitting on the memory buffer, our framework employs a knowledge distillation strategy that transfers knowledge from previous models to the current one. Extensive experiments on multiple FCED benchmarks demonstrate that LEAF consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

To address this issue, we propose the Experience-Guided Reflective Co-Evolution of Prompt and Heuristics (EvoPH) for automatic algorithm design, a novel framework that integrates the island migration model with the elites selection algorithm to simulate diverse heuristics populations. In EvoPH, prompts are co-evolved with heuristic algorithms, guided by performance feedback. We evaluate our framework on two problems, i.e., Traveling Salesman Problem and Bin Packing Problem. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoPH achieves the lowest relative error against optimal solutions across both datasets, advancing the field of automatic algorithm design with LLMs.",

However, it still remains a critical unresolved challenge for Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs).To fill this gap, we propose to treat Euclidean geometry problem-solving as a surrogate task. Specifically, we meticulously constructed a curated multimodal dataset, called Euclid30K, comprising approximately 30K plane and solid geometry problems. To enable the model to acquire and apply Euclidean principles from these geometry problems, we employed Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to finetune the Qwen2.5VL family and RoboBrain2.0 family, inspiring the models to identify shapes, count, and relate entities, and perform multi-step deductive reasoning using Euclidean principles. Our experiments demonstrate that the resulting models achieve substantial zero-shot gains across four spatial reasoning benchmarks (Super-CLEVR, Omni3DBench, VSI-Bench, and MindCube) without any task-specific adaptations. Notably, after training on the Euclid30K, the mean VSI-Bench accuracy of all evaluated models rose from 34.5% to 40.5%, improving by 5.5 percentage points. Among them, RoboBrain2.0-Euclid-7B achieves 49.6\\% accuracy, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art model, Spatial-MLLM.To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study showing that geometry-centric fine-tuning can confer vision-language models with broadly transferable spatial skills.

        "summary": "The performance of Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models is fundamentally constrained by the nature of their supervision, which typically consists of isolated, factual question-answer pairs. This \"bag-of-facts\" approach fails to capture the underlying narrative and causal structure of events, limiting models to a shallow understanding of video content. To move beyond this paradigm, we introduce a framework to synthesize richer supervisory signals. We propose two complementary strategies: Question-Based Paraphrasing (QBP), which synthesizes the diverse inquiries (what, how, why) from a video's existing set of question-answer pairs into a holistic narrative paragraph that reconstructs the video's event structure; and Question-Based Captioning (QBC), which generates fine-grained visual rationales, grounding the answer to each question in specific, relevant evidence. Leveraging powerful generative models, we use this synthetic data to train VideoQA models under a unified next-token prediction objective. Extensive experiments on STAR and NExT-QA validate our approach, demonstrating significant accuracy gains and establishing new state-of-the-art results, such as improving a 3B model to 72.5\\% on STAR (+4.9\\%) and a 7B model to 80.8\\% on NExT-QA. Beyond accuracy, our analysis reveals that both QBP and QBC substantially enhance cross-dataset generalization, with QBP additionally accelerating model convergence by over 2.5x. These results demonstrate that shifting data synthesis from isolated facts to narrative coherence and grounded rationales yields a more accurate, efficient, and generalizable training paradigm.",

        "summary": "Although Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have progressed in solving complex problems, their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning often contains harmful content that can persist even when the final responses appear safe. We show that this issue still remains in existing methods which overlook the unique significance of safe reasoning, undermining their trustworthiness and posing potential risks in applications if unsafe reasoning is accessible for and exploited by malicious users. We therefore shift our focus to aligning the safety of reasoning itself in this paper and explore process supervision as the solution. However, simply rewarding safe reasoning proves inadequate due to low rollout diversity and limited training signals. To tackle this challenge, we first delve into the characteristics of safe reasoning and uncover several critical insights that 1) safe reasoning is often consolidated by a few critical steps of safety triggers; 2) compliance cues strongly correlate with unsafe continuations; and 3) corrective interventions reliably steer unsafe trajectories towards safer traces. Motivated by these, we propose Intervened Preference Optimization (IPO), an alignment method that enforces safe reasoning by substituting compliance steps with safety triggers and constructing pairs for preference learning with strong signals. Experiments on jailbreak and adversarial safety benchmarks demonstrate that IPO remarkably improves overall safety regarding both reasoning and responses, outperforming SFT-based and RL-based baselines with a relative reduction of over 30% in harmfulness, while preserving excellent performance across diverse reasoning tasks. The results highlight the importance of explicit alignment for reasoning and provide a practical path to safer LRMs.",

        "summary": "The ability to represent emotion plays a significant role in human cognition and social interaction, yet the high-dimensional geometry of this affective space and its neural underpinnings remain debated. A key challenge, the `behavior-neural gap,' is the limited ability of human self-reports to predict brain activity. Here we test the hypothesis that this gap arises from the constraints of traditional rating scales and that large-scale similarity judgments can more faithfully capture the brain's affective geometry. Using AI models as `cognitive agents,' we collected millions of triplet odd-one-out judgments from a multimodal large language model (MLLM) and a language-only model (LLM) in response to 2,180 emotionally evocative videos. We found that the emergent 30-dimensional embeddings from these models are highly interpretable and organize emotion primarily along categorical lines, yet in a blended fashion that incorporates dimensional properties. Most remarkably, the MLLM's representation predicted neural activity in human emotion-processing networks with the highest accuracy, outperforming not only the LLM but also, counterintuitively, representations derived directly from human behavioral ratings. This result supports our primary hypothesis and suggests that sensory grounding--learning from rich visual data--is critical for developing a truly neurally-aligned conceptual framework for emotion. Our findings provide compelling evidence that MLLMs can autonomously develop rich, neurally-aligned affective representations, offering a powerful paradigm to bridge the gap between subjective experience and its neural substrates.

Existing verification studies in scientific domains suffer from two major limitations: (a) the absence of systematic evaluation standards and insufficient disciplinary coverage, which hinders their comprehensive assessment; and (b) heavy reliance on cumbersome rule design or prompt engineering, which reduces their effectiveness in complex reasoning scenarios or limits their cross-disciplinary generalization. To address these challenges, we propose solutions at both the data and model levels.

The benchmark is built from real LLM responses and enhanced with domain-specific equivalence transformations that generate challenging and realistic data. Model-based and expert annotations ensure both quality and diversity, enabling rigorous evaluation of verification ability. On the model side, we emphasize the importance of reasoning for verification and introduce SCI-Verifier, a unified reasoning-augmented verifier for scientific domains. Through post-training, SCI-Verifier demonstrates strong logical reasoning and equivalence judgment capabilities while maintaining concise and stable outputs. Together, SCI-VerifyBench and SCI-Verifier provide a principled framework for scientific verification, offering both systematic evaluation and practical pathways to enhance the reliability and applicability of LLMs in scientific domains.",

This effect stems from models being trained to imitate perfect reasoning scripts without learning to self-correct. To address this limitation, we propose AdvChain, an alignment paradigm that teaches models dynamic self-correction through adversarial CoT tuning. Our method involves constructing a dataset containing Temptation-Correction and Hesitation-Correction samples, where models learn to recover from harmful reasoning drifts and unnecessary cautions. Extensive experiments show that AdvChain significantly enhances robustness against jailbreak attacks and CoT hijacking while substantially reducing over-refusal on benign prompts, achieving a superior safety-utility balance without compromising reasoning capabilities.

        "summary": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved notable gains in various tasks by incorporating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language spaces. Recent work extends this direction by leveraging external tools for visual editing, thereby enhancing the visual signal along the reasoning trajectories. Nevertheless, these approaches remain fundamentally constrained: reasoning is still confined to the language space, with visual information treated as static preconditions. We introduce Latent Visual Reasoning (LVR), a new paradigm that enables autoregressive reasoning directly in the visual embedding space. A visual encoder first projects images into visual tokens within a joint semantic space shared with the language model. The language model is then trained to generate latent states that reconstruct key visual tokens critical for answering the query, constituting the process of latent visual reasoning. By interleaving LVR with standard text generation, our model achieves substantial gains on perception-intensive visual question answering tasks. In addition, we adapt the GRPO algorithm to conduct reinforcement learning on latent reasoning, further balancing LVR and textual generation. We show that LVR substantially improves fine-grained visual understanding and perception, achieving 71.67% on MMVP compared to 66.67% with Qwen2.5-VL. Code base and model weights will be released later.",

        "summary": "Despite their strong performance on reasoning tasks, large reasoning models (LRMs) often suffer from overthinking, producing unnecessarily long outputs and incurring high end-to-end latency, a significant limitation to their real-world deployment. To address overthinking, early-exit mechanisms have been proposed to terminate reasoning before typical completion, showing that this approach can effectively shorten generation length with minimal impact on accuracy. However, their reliance on probing mechanisms introduces a detection overhead that limits their end-to-end latency gains and compromises their generalizability across diverse problems. Inspired by the use of hidden states in speculative decoding, we propose SpecExit, a novel framework that predicts both future tokens and an early-exit signal directly from a lightweight draft model without probing overhead. Our method offers significant improvements, reducing average generation length by 66\\% and achieving a 2.5x speedup in end-to-end latency compared to the speculative decoding baseline, without compromising accuracy. Our method leverages the inherent signals from hidden states to provide effective early-exit signals, suggesting broader use of hidden states for efficient reasoning.

We present FR-Ponder, a single-graph, backbone-training-free framework that allocates instance-adaptive reasoning compute via latent steering. A less than 1M-param controller observes hidden states and decides to halt or apply a small ponder step by adding a pre-computed steering vector to frozen representations. Our method extracts the latent steering vector associated with deeper reasoning outputs and direct IO from LLM and re-applies it through a tunable scaling factor, allowing the model to adapt its reasoning depth to the complexity of each input. To balance performance and computational cost, we employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) as a reward signal to adaptively regulate reasoning depth, achieving task accuracy while mitigating overreasoning. Through curriculum learning and careful reward engineering, FR-Ponder learns calibrated compute allocation correlated with problem difficulty. On GSM8K and MATH500, FR-Ponder improves the compute-accuracy frontier, delivering lower FLOPs with better matched accuracy and comparing favorably to early-exit baselines, without modifying backbone weights. Analyses visualize interpretable steering directions and show learned compute allocation correlates with problem difficulty.",

        "summary": "The rapid growth of audio-centric platforms and applications such as WhatsApp and Twitter has transformed the way people communicate and share audio content in modern society. However, these platforms are increasingly misused to disseminate harmful audio content, such as hate speech, deceptive advertisements, and explicit material, which can have significant negative consequences (e.g., detrimental effects on mental health). In response, researchers and practitioners have been actively developing and deploying audio content moderation tools to tackle this issue. Despite these efforts, malicious actors can bypass moderation systems by making subtle alterations to audio content, such as modifying pitch or inserting noise. Moreover, the effectiveness of modern audio moderation tools against such adversarial inputs remains insufficiently studied. To address these challenges, we propose MTAM, a Metamorphic Testing framework for Audio content Moderation software. Specifically, we conduct a pilot study on 2000 audio clips and define 14 metamorphic relations across two perturbation categories: Audio Features-Based and Heuristic perturbations. MTAM applies these metamorphic relations to toxic audio content to generate test cases that remain harmful while being more likely to evade detection. In our evaluation, we employ MTAM to test five commercial textual content moderation software and an academic model against three kinds of toxic content. The results show that MTAM achieves up to 38.6%, 18.3%, 35.1%, 16.7%, and 51.1% error finding rates (EFR) when testing commercial moderation software provided by Gladia, Assembly AI, Baidu, Nextdata, and Tencent, respectively, and it obtains up to 45.7% EFR when testing the state-of-the-art algorithms from the academy.",

While classic REINFORCE and its modern variants like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) are typically regarded as on-policy algorithms with limited tolerance of off-policyness, we present in this work a first-principles derivation for group-relative REINFORCE without assuming a specific training data distribution, showing that it admits a native off-policy interpretation. This perspective yields two general principles for adapting REINFORCE to off-policy settings: regularizing policy updates, and actively shaping the data distribution. Our analysis demystifies some myths about the roles of importance sampling and clipping in GRPO, unifies and reinterprets two recent algorithms -- Online Policy Mirror Descent (OPMD) and Asymmetric REINFORCE (AsymRE) -- as regularized forms of the REINFORCE loss, and offers theoretical justification for seemingly heuristic data-weighting strategies. Our findings lead to actionable insights that are validated with extensive empirical studies, and open up new opportunities for principled algorithm design in off-policy RL for LLMs. Source code for this work is available at https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/rec_gsm8k.",

However, recent studies reveal that their final answers often contradict their own reasoning traces. We hypothesize that this inconsistency stems from two competing mechanisms for generating answers: CoT reasoning and memory retrieval. To test this hypothesis, we conduct controlled experiments that challenge LRMs with misleading cues during reasoning and/or corrupted answers during retrieval. Our results across models and datasets confirm that both mechanisms operate simultaneously, with their relative dominance influenced by multiple factors: problem domains, model scales, and fine-tuning approaches (e.g., reinforcement learning vs. distillation). The findings reveal a critical limitation in current reasoning fine-tuning paradigms: models can exploit the retrieval mechanism as a shortcut, effectively \"hacking\" the reward signal and undermining genuine reasoning development. To address this challenge, we introduce FARL, a novel fine-tuning framework that integrates memory unlearning with reinforcement learning. By carefully suppressing retrieval shortcuts during the fine-tuning process, FARL promotes reasoning-dominant behavior and enhances generalizable reasoning capabilities.",

To tackle this problem, we propose GMS: Generalist Scanner Meets Specialist Locator, a synergistic coarse-to-fine framework that effectively improves GUI grounding performance. GMS leverages the complementary strengths of general vision-language models (VLMs) and small, task-specific GUI grounding models by assigning them distinct roles within the framework. Specifically, the general VLM acts as a 'Scanner' to identify potential regions of interest, while the fine-tuned grounding model serves as a 'Locator' that outputs precise coordinates within these regions. This design is inspired by how humans perform GUI grounding, where the eyes scan the interface and the brain focuses on interpretation and localization. Our whole framework consists of five stages and incorporates hierarchical search with cross-modal communication to achieve promising prediction results. Experimental results on the ScreenSpot-Pro dataset show that while the 'Scanner' and 'Locator' models achieve only $2.0\\%$ and $3.7\\%$ accuracy respectively when used independently, their integration within GMS framework yields an overall accuracy of $35.7\\%$, representing a $10 \\times$ improvement. Additionally, GMS significantly outperforms other strong baselines under various settings, demonstrating its robustness and potential for general-purpose GUI grounding.",

Using mixed-effects logistic regression, domain-level marginal means, rank-instability analysis, and run-to-run reliability, we assessed the value of additional repetitions. Our findings shows that Single-run leaderboards are brittle: 10/12 slices (83\\%) invert at least one pairwise rank relative to the three-run majority, despite a zero sign-flip rate for pairwise significance and moderate overall interclass correlation. Averaging runs yields modest SE shrinkage ($\\sim$5\\% from one to three) but large ranking gains; two runs remove $\\sim$83\\% of single-run inversions. We provide cost-aware guidance for practitioners: treat evaluation as an experiment, report uncertainty, and use $\\geq 2$ repetitions under stochastic decoding.

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) for large language models (LLMs) has achieved remarkable progress in enhancing LLMs' reasoning capabilities on tasks with clear correctness criteria, such as mathematical reasoning tasks. Several training metrics, such as entropy or response length, have been observed to correlate with different reasoning behaviors in reinforcement learning. Prior approaches incorporate such priors through reward or advantage shaping, which often relies on hand-crafted penalties and preferences (e.g., higher-is-better or lower-is-better). However, without careful hyperparameter tuning, these directional priors can be overly biased and may lead to failure. To this end, we introduce Conditional advANtage estimatiON (CANON), amplifying the impact of the target metric without presuming its direction. Specifically, CANON regroups the sampled responses into two groups based on the higher or lower value of a target metric, measures which metric trend contributes to better performance through inter-group comparison, and identifies the better response within the same group. In summary, CANON based on entropy consistently outperforms prior methods across three LLMs on both math reasoning and high-complexity logic tasks. When applied to response length, CANON further improves token efficiency, yielding a more favorable Pareto frontier in the performance-cost trade-off.",

        "summary": "Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and its variants have markedly advanced the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet their monolithic and auto-regressive architecture inherently conflates high-level strategic planning with low-level step-by-step execution, leading to computational inefficiency, limited exploration of reasoning paths, and reduced interpretability. To overcome these issues, we propose the Explore-Execute Chain ($E^2C$), a structured reasoning framework that decouples reasoning into two distinct phases: an exploratory phase that stochastically generates succinct high-level plans, followed by an execution phase that deterministically carries out the chosen plan. Our approach incorporates a two-stage training methodology, which combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) - augmented by a novel data generation algorithm enforcing strict plan adherence - with a subsequent Reinforcement Learning (RL) stage that capitalizes on the informativeness of exploration and reinforces the determinism of execution.This decomposition enables an efficient test-time scaling strategy: on AIME'2024, $E^2C$ Test Time Scaling reaches 58.1% accuracy using <10% of the decoding tokens required by comparable methods (e.g., Forest-of-Thought), sharply cutting self-consistency overhead. For cross-domain adaptation, our Exploration-Focused SFT (EF-SFT) fine-tunes with only 3.5% of the tokens used by standard SFT yet yields up to 14.5% higher accuracy than standard SFT on medical benchmarks, delivering state-of-the-art performance, strong generalization, and greater interpretability by separating planning from execution.

To address this, we propose Dynamic Orthogonal Continual (DOC) fine-tuning, a novel approach that tracks the drift of these functional directions and dynamically updates them during the fine-tuning process. Furthermore, by adjusting the gradients of new task parameters to be orthogonal to the tracked historical function directions, our method mitigates interference between new and old tasks.

        "summary": "A prevailing view in Reinforcement Learning for Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) interprets recent progress through the lens of an exploration-exploitation trade-off, a perspective largely shaped by token-level metrics. We re-examine this perspective, proposing that this perceived trade-off may not be a fundamental constraint but rather an artifact of the measurement level. To investigate this, we shift the analysis to the semantically rich hidden-state space, adopting Effective Rank (ER) to quantify exploration and proposing its novel first- and second-order derivatives, named Effective Rank Velocity (ERV) and Effective Rank Acceleration (ERA), to capture exploitation dynamics. Our analysis reveals that at the hidden-state level, exploration and exploitation could be decoupled (Sec. 4). This finding reveals an opportunity to enhance both capacities simultaneously. This insight motivates our method, Velocity-Exploiting Rank-Learning (VERL), the first to operationalize the principle of synergistic exploration-exploitation enhancement by directly shaping the RL advantage function. The key innovation is leveraging the theoretically stable ERA as a predictive meta-controller to create a synergistic, dual-channel incentive structure. Instead of forcing a trade-off, VERL prospectively amplifies rewards for exploration to preempt overconfidence and reinforces exploitative gains to consolidate reasoning. Experiments across diverse LLMs and reasoning benchmarks show consistent gains, including up to 21.4% absolute accuracy improvement on the challenging Gaokao 2024 dataset.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly studied as neural knowledge bases for supporting knowledge-intensive applications such as question answering and fact checking. However, the structural organization of their knowledge remains unexplored. Inspired by cognitive neuroscience findings, such as semantic clustering and priming, where knowing one fact increases the likelihood of recalling related facts, we investigate an analogous knowledge homophily pattern in LLMs. To this end, we map LLM knowledge into a graph representation through knowledge checking at both the triplet and entity levels. After that, we analyze the knowledgeability relationship between an entity and its neighbors, discovering that LLMs tend to possess a similar level of knowledge about entities positioned closer in the graph. Motivated by this homophily principle, we propose a Graph Neural Network (GNN) regression model to estimate entity-level knowledgeability scores for triplets by leveraging their neighborhood scores. The predicted knowledgeability enables us to prioritize checking less well-known triplets, thereby maximizing knowledge coverage under the same labeling budget. This not only improves the efficiency of active labeling for fine-tuning to inject knowledge into LLMs but also enhances multi-hop path retrieval in reasoning-intensive question answering.",

With the rapid development of large language models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging their reasoning and planning capabilities for reaction condition recommendation.

In this work, we propose ChemMAS, a multi-agent system that reframes condition prediction as an evidence-based reasoning task. ChemMAS decomposes the task into mechanistic grounding, multi-channel recall, constraint-aware agentic debate, and rationale aggregation. Each decision is backed by interpretable justifications grounded in chemical knowledge and retrieved precedents. Experiments show that ChemMAS achieves 20-35% gains over domain-specific baselines and outperforms general-purpose LLMs by 10-15% in Top-1 accuracy, while offering falsifiable, human-trustable rationales, which establishes a new paradigm for explainable AI in scientific discovery.",

        "summary": "Post-training of large language models involves a fundamental trade-off between supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which efficiently mimics demonstrations but tends to memorize, and reinforcement learning (RL), which achieves better generalization at higher computational cost. Dynamic Fine-Tuning (DFT) recently emerged as a promising middle ground, reweighting SFT objectives with token probabilities and achieving improvements in certain reasoning domains, though it exhibits instability in other tasks. We provide a analysis of DFT through the reward-weighted regression (RWR) framework, revealing that it corresponds to a specific auxiliary distribution choice that yields provably tighter RL bounds than standard SFT. However, our analysis also uncovers a critical limitation: this construction lacks distributional anchoring, leading to progressive drift that undermines training stability. To address this, we propose Anchored Supervised Fine-Tuning (ASFT), which augments DFT's reweighting with lightweight KL regularization to preserve tightness while ensuring stability. Empirically, ASFT consistently outperforms both SFT and DFT across mathematical reasoning, medical knowledge grounding, and code generation, achieving substantial improvements with minimal computational overhead. Our RWR framework provides a systematic lens for understanding post-training methods and demonstrates that principled theoretical analysis leads to both stronger guarantees and practical gains.",

Game-Theory-Optimal (GTO) provides strategies to avoid loss in poker, but pure GTO does not guarantee maximum profit. To this end, we aim to develop a model that outperforms GTO strategies to maximize profit in No Limit Holdem, in heads-up (two-player) and multi-way (more than two-player) situations. Our model finds the GTO foundation and goes further to exploit opponents. The model first navigates toward many simulated poker hands against itself and keeps adjusting its decisions until no action can reliably beat it, creating a strong baseline that is close to the theoretical best strategy. Then, it adapts by observing opponent behavior and adjusting its strategy to capture extra value accordingly. Our results indicate that Monte-Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (CFR) performs best in heads-up situations and CFR remains the strongest method in most multi-way situations. By combining the defensive strength of GTO with real-time exploitation, our approach aims to show how poker agents can move from merely not losing to consistently winning against diverse opponents.",

        "summary": "Embodied agents can identify and report safety hazards in the home environments. Accurately evaluating their capabilities in home safety inspection tasks is curcial, but existing benchmarks suffer from two key limitations. First, they oversimplify safety inspection tasks by using textual descriptions of the environment instead of direct visual information, which hinders the accurate evaluation of embodied agents based on Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Second, they use a single, static viewpoint for environmental observation, which restricts the agents' free exploration and cause the omission of certain safety hazards, especially those that are occluded from a fixed viewpoint. To alleviate these issues, we propose HomeSafeBench, a benchmark with 12,900 data points covering five common home safety hazards: fire, electric shock, falling object, trips, and child safety. HomeSafeBench provides dynamic first-person perspective images from simulated home environments, enabling the evaluation of VLM capabilities for home safety inspection. By allowing the embodied agents to freely explore the room, HomeSafeBench provides multiple dynamic perspectives in complex environments for a more thorough inspection. Our comprehensive evaluation of mainstream VLMs on HomeSafeBench reveals that even the best-performing model achieves an F1-score of only 10.23%, demonstrating significant limitations in current VLMs. The models particularly struggle with identifying safety hazards and selecting effective exploration strategies. We hope HomeSafeBench will provide valuable reference and support for future research related to home security inspections. Our dataset and code will be publicly available soon.",

However, existing scaling laws for dense models are inapplicable to MoE models, which stems from three critical challenges: the multiplicity of influencing factors, their intricate coupling relationships and the non-monotonic nature of their performance impacts. They collectively necessitate a fine-grained investigation into MoE-specific scaling laws. In this work, we perform a systematic decomposition of MoE settings, identifying five key factors that influence model performance from both size and structural perspectives (data size ($D$), total model size ($N$), activated model size ($N_a$), number of active experts ($G$) and the ratio of shared experts ($S$)). Specifically, we design $446$ controlled experiments to characterize their marginal effects, ultimately constructing a comprehensive and precise joint MoE scaling law that considers all essential factors. Furthermore, we derive the theoretically optimal and practically efficiency-aware optimal configurations for $G$, $S$ and $N_a/N$ with detailed analyses. Our results demonstrate that the optimal settings for $G$ and $S$ are independent of both the model architecture and data size. With the scaling of $N$, the optimal activation parameter ratio of $N_a/N$ becomes sparser. Our proposed MoE scaling law could function as an accurate and insightful guidance to facilitate future MoE model design and training.",

Third, we apply mechanistic interventions using activation patching to assess the dependence of answer tokens on reasoning activations. Our results show that perturbations to key reasoning tokens can reliably alter the final answers, confirming a directional and functional flow of information from reasoning to answer. These findings deepen our understanding of how LRMs leverage reasoning tokens for answer generation, highlighting the functional role of intermediate reasoning in shaping model outputs.

However, its potential is fundamentally constrained by the reliance on purely autoregressive training. This approach focuses solely on predicting the next item while ignoring the rich internal structure of a user's interaction history, thus failing to grasp the underlying intent. To address this limitation, we propose Masked History Learning (MHL), a novel training framework that shifts the objective from simple next-step prediction to deep comprehension of history. MHL augments the standard autoregressive objective with an auxiliary task of reconstructing masked historical items, compelling the model to understand ``why'' an item path is formed from the user's past behaviors, rather than just ``what'' item comes next. We introduce two key contributions to enhance this framework: (1) an entropy-guided masking policy that intelligently targets the most informative historical items for reconstruction, and (2) a curriculum learning scheduler that progressively transitions from history reconstruction to future prediction. Experiments on three public datasets show that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art generative models, highlighting that a comprehensive understanding of the past is crucial for accurately predicting a user's future path.

In this work, we present a large-scale empirical study to quantify these dependencies across 23 visual question-answering benchmarks using multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) covering domains such as general and expert knowledge reasoning, optical character recognition, and document understanding. Our findings show that the reliance on vision, question (text), and their interaction varies significantly, both across and within benchmarks.

Benchmark signatures probe the capacity required for benchmark performance. We formally define them as a set of salient tokens drawn from in-the-wild, naturally authored corpora, where LLM token perplexity, reflecting more or less pre-training exposure, becomes highly predictive of LLM benchmark performance. Through a large-scale meta-evaluation, we extract benchmark signatures via stepwise forward selection with linear regressions across 32 LLMs and 88 benchmarks spanning diverse knowledge, coding, logic, instruction following, math, language, reasoning, and world modeling. Our analysis situates signatures in relation to both the semantic similarity of benchmark questions and the correlation of model performance. While performance overlaps are universally high and semantic overlaps remain confined to a narrow mid-range, benchmark signatures prove highly informative in capturing variation, overlap, and divergence. We observe overlap in knowledge and reasoning subtasks, whereas multilingual and cultural benchmarks exhibit less similarity, even compared to cross-task overlap. Notably, performance-level results are strongly influenced by benchmark-orthogonal factors such as question format, highlighting limitations in LLM generalization, the conflation of performance with ability, and issues inherent in current mainstream benchmark agreement studies. Benchmark signatures, however, remain robust to such effects. Ultimately, we identify cross-functional overlaps across logic, math, language, instruction following, and world modeling, with coding emerging as the least overlapping domain.

We benchmark several methods within these categories on a diverse set of temporal tasks, including language modeling, news summarization, news tag prediction, academic paper categorization, satellite image-based land use classification over time, and historical yearbook photo gender prediction. Our empirical findings show that none of the evaluated methods consistently outperforms the simple baseline of using the latest available model parameters in all scenarios. In the absence of access to future data or robust assumptions about the underlying data-generating process, these results underscore the inherent difficulties of generalizing and extrapolating to future data and warrant caution when evaluating claims of such generalization.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance on tasks that require reasoning, such as text-to-SQL, code generation, and debugging. However, regulatory frameworks with strict privacy requirements constrain their integration into sensitive systems. State-of-the-art LLMs are also proprietary, costly, and resource-intensive, making local deployment impractical. Consequently, utilizing such LLMs often requires sharing data with third-party providers, raising privacy concerns and risking noncompliance with regulations. Although fine-tuned small language models (SLMs) can outperform LLMs on certain tasks and be deployed locally to mitigate privacy concerns, they underperform on more complex tasks such as text-to-SQL translation. In this work, we introduce MaskSQL, a text-to-SQL framework that utilizes abstraction as a privacy protection mechanism to mask sensitive information in LLM prompts. Unlike redaction, which removes content entirely, or generalization, which broadens tokens, abstraction retains essential information while discarding unnecessary details, striking an effective privacy-utility balance for the text-to-SQL task. Moreover, by providing mechanisms to control the privacy-utility tradeoff, MaskSQL facilitates adoption across a broader range of use cases. Our experimental results show that MaskSQL outperforms leading SLM-based text-to-SQL models and achieves performance approaching state-of-the-art LLM-based models, while preserving privacy.",

        "summary": "Frame of Reference (FoR) is a fundamental concept in spatial reasoning that humans utilize to comprehend and describe space. With the rapid progress in Multimodal Language models, the moment has come to integrate this long-overlooked dimension into these models. In particular, in text-to-image (T2I) generation, even state-of-the-art models exhibit a significant performance gap when spatial descriptions are provided from perspectives other than the camera. To address this limitation, we propose Frame of Reference-guided Spatial Adjustment in LLM-based Diffusion Editing (FoR-SALE), an extension of the Self-correcting LLM-controlled Diffusion (SLD) framework for T2I. For-Sale evaluates the alignment between a given text and an initially generated image, and refines the image based on the Frame of Reference specified in the spatial expressions. It employs vision modules to extract the spatial configuration of the image, while simultaneously mapping the spatial expression to a corresponding camera perspective. This unified perspective enables direct evaluation of alignment between language and vision. When misalignment is detected, the required editing operations are generated and applied. FoR-SALE applies novel latent-space operations to adjust the facing direction and depth of the generated images. We evaluate FoR-SALE on two benchmarks specifically designed to assess spatial understanding with FoR. Our framework improves the performance of state-of-the-art T2I models by up to 5.3% using only a single round of correction.",

We introduce SPIKE, an inference-time framework that quantifies Bayesian Surprise as the belief update triggered by new visual evidence in the video stream, identifying moments where new visual evidence conflicts with prior beliefs. SPIKE effectively localizes surprise in videos, strongly correlated with humans on positive (FunQA) and negative (Oops!) surprise benchmarks. Since the beliefs of zero-shot Video-LLMs are often suboptimal, we develop SPIKE-RL, which leverages GRPO to optimize belief hypotheses based on a reward signal from the video caption. SPIKE and SPIKE-RL guide query-agnostic surprise-weighted frame sampling, which allocates more frames to interesting moments in the video. With this strategy, we achieve consistent performance gains on five downstream benchmarks over uniform sampling. By enabling Video-LLMs to track beliefs and register surprise, our work paves the way for more robust models that can revise their understanding in response to new information.",

To achieve efficient reasoning, existing reinforcement learning methods still struggle to construct short reasoning path during the rollout stage, limiting effective learning.

Based on this insight, we propose Just-Enough Thinking (JET), which trains models to proactively terminate unnecessary reasoning. JET performs trajectory truncation during rollout to expose the model to short, distributionally consistent reasoning paths. Besides, it uses a quality-controlled length reward to better encourage concise reasoning while maintaining correctness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that JET significantly improves reasoning efficiency without sacrificing accuracy.

Existing SQL benchmarks are not well-suited for SQL-to-SQL evaluation, which (1) focus on a limited set of database systems (often just SQLite) and (2) cannot capture many system-specific SQL dialects (e.g., customized functions, data types, and syntax rules). Thus, in this paper, we introduce PARROT, a Practical And Realistic BenchmaRk for CrOss-System SQL Translation. PARROT comprises 598 translation pairs from 38 open-source benchmarks and real-world business services, specifically prepared to challenge system-specific SQL understanding (e.g., LLMS achieve lower than 38.53% accuracy on average).

While a variety of such sampling methods have been proposed, their performance can be sensitive to the selection of hyperparameters which may require different settings depending upon the generation task and temperature configuration. In this work, we introduce $p$-less sampling: an information-theoretic approach to sampling which dynamically sets a truncation threshold at each decoding step based on the entire token probability distribution. Unlike existing methods, $p$-less sampling has no hyperparameters and consistently produces high-quality outputs as temperature increases. We provide theoretical perspectives on $p$-less sampling to ground our proposed method and conduct experiments to empirically validate its effectiveness across a range of math, logical reasoning, and creative writing tasks. Our results demonstrate how $p$-less sampling consistently outperforms existing sampling approaches while exhibiting much less degradation in text quality at higher temperature values. We further show how $p$-less achieves greater inference-time efficiency than alternative methods through lower average token sampling times and shorter generation lengths, without sacrificing accuracy. Finally, we provide analyses to highlight the benefits of $p$-less through qualitative examples, case studies, and diversity assessments.",

However, the training process remains bottlenecked by the computationally expensive rollout stage. Existing acceleration methods-such as parallelization, objective- and data-driven modifications, and replay buffers-either incur diminishing returns, introduce bias, or overlook redundancy across iterations. We identify that rollouts from consecutive training epochs frequently share a large portion of overlapping segments, wasting computation. To address this, we propose SPEC-RL, a novel framework that integrates SPECulative decoding with the RL rollout process. SPEC-RL reuses prior trajectory segments as speculative prefixes and extends them via a draft-and-verify mechanism, avoiding redundant generation while ensuring policy consistency. Experiments on diverse math reasoning and generalization benchmarks, including GSM8K, MATH-500, OlympiadBench, MMLU-STEM, and others, demonstrate that SPEC-RL reduces rollout time by 2-3x without compromising policy quality. As a purely rollout-stage enhancement, SPEC-RL integrates seamlessly with mainstream algorithms (e.g., PPO, GRPO, DAPO), offering a general and practical path to scale RLVR for large reasoning models.

In this study, we propose a simple yet effective confidence-calibration group sequence policy gradient method, called C$^2$GSPG, which simultaneously enhances reasoning performance while suppressing overconfidence. In principle, we propose a Group Sequence Policy Gradient (GSPG) framework for learning reasoning models, which eliminates the token-level bias commonly appearing in GRPO and its variants. In this framework, we define the model confidence for each reasoning problem using the normalized sequence-level probability, and then apply a cross-entropy regularizer to calibrate the model confidence to the sequence's reward. We demonstrate that the confidence calibration regularizer and GSPG are collaborative for binary rewards, as their objectives always share the same gradient direction. For non-binary rewards, we apply nonlinear reward normalization and adaptive regularizer clipping, mitigating the potential conflict between the two objectives. Applying C$^2$GSPG to post-train large language models in logical and mathematical reasoning tasks, we show its superiority over state-of-the-art methods in both reasoning accuracy and confidence calibration.

Methodologically, RHYTHM employs temporal tokenization to partition each trajectory into daily segments and encode them as discrete tokens with hierarchical attention that captures both daily and weekly dependencies, thereby significantly reducing the sequence length while preserving cyclical information. Additionally, we enrich token representations by adding pre-computed prompt embeddings for trajectory segments and prediction targets via a frozen LLM, and feeding these combined embeddings back into the LLM backbone to capture complex interdependencies.

However, reward-based methods built on the Bradley-Terry assumption struggle to capture the non-transitive and heterogeneous nature of real-world preferences. To address this, recent studies have reframed alignment as a two-player Nash game, giving rise to Nash learning from human feedback (NLHF). While this perspective has inspired algorithms such as INPO, ONPO, and EGPO with strong theoretical and empirical guarantees, they remain fundamentally restricted to two-player interactions, creating a single-opponent bias that fails to capture the full complexity of realistic preference structures. In this work, we introduce Multiplayer Nash Preference Optimization (MNPO), a novel framework that generalizes NLHF to the multiplayer regime. It formulates alignment as an $n$-player game, where each policy competes against a population of opponents while being regularized toward a reference model. Our framework establishes well-defined Nash equilibria in multiplayer settings and extends the concept of duality gap to quantify approximation quality. We demonstrate that MNPO inherits the equilibrium guarantees of two-player methods while enabling richer competitive dynamics and improved coverage of diverse preference structures. Through comprehensive empirical evaluation, we show that MNPO consistently outperforms existing NLHF baselines on instruction-following benchmarks, achieving superior alignment quality under heterogeneous annotator conditions and mixed-policy evaluation scenarios. Together, these results establish MNPO as a principled and scalable framework for aligning LLMs with complex, non-transitive human preferences.

While it has been validated to significantly enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) during training and has been widely adopted in LLM development, potential security risks it may introduce remain uninvestigated. This paper systematically evaluates the resilience of synthetic-data-integrated training paradigm for LLMs against mainstream poisoning and backdoor attacks. We reveal that such a paradigm exhibits strong resistance to existing attacks, primarily thanks to the different distribution patterns between poisoning data and queries used to generate synthetic samples. To enhance the effectiveness of these attacks and further investigate the security risks introduced by synthetic data, we introduce a novel and universal attack framework, namely, Virus Infection Attack (VIA), which enables the propagation of current attacks through synthetic data even under purely clean queries. Inspired by the principles of virus design in cybersecurity, VIA conceals the poisoning payload within a protective \"shell\" and strategically searches for optimal hijacking points in benign samples to maximize the likelihood of generating malicious content. Extensive experiments on both data poisoning and backdoor attacks show that VIA significantly increases the presence of poisoning content in synthetic data and correspondingly raises the attack success rate (ASR) on downstream models to levels comparable to those observed in the poisoned upstream models.",

We take a spectral approach to investigate the geometry of learned representations across pretraining and post-training, measuring effective rank (RankMe) and eigenspectrum decay ($\\alpha$-ReQ). With OLMo (1B-7B) and Pythia (160M-12B) models, we uncover a consistent non-monotonic sequence of three geometric phases during autoregressive pretraining. The initial \"warmup\" phase exhibits rapid representational collapse. This is followed by an \"entropy-seeking\" phase, where the manifold's dimensionality expands substantially, coinciding with peak n-gram memorization. Subsequently, a \"compression-seeking\" phase imposes anisotropic consolidation, selectively preserving variance along dominant eigendirections while contracting others, a transition marked with significant improvement in downstream task performance. We show these phases can emerge from a fundamental interplay of cross-entropy optimization under skewed token frequencies and representational bottlenecks ($d \\ll |V|$). Post-training further transforms geometry: SFT and DPO drive \"entropy-seeking\" dynamics to integrate specific instructional or preferential data, improving in-distribution performance while degrading out-of-distribution robustness. Conversely, RLVR induces \"compression-seeking\", enhancing reward alignment but reducing generation diversity.",

A major challenge lies in generating accurate and natural body poses and movements that faithfully convey intended meanings. Prior methods often neglect the anatomical constraints and coordination patterns of human skeletal motion, resulting in rigid or biomechanically implausible outputs. To address this, we propose a novel approach that explicitly models the relationships among skeletal joints--including shoulders, arms, and hands--by incorporating geometric constraints on joint positions, bone lengths, and movement dynamics. During training, we introduce a parent-relative reweighting mechanism to enhance finger flexibility and reduce motion stiffness. Additionally, bone-pose losses and bone-length constraints enforce anatomically consistent structures. Our method narrows the performance gap between the previous best and the ground-truth oracle by 56.51%, and further reduces discrepancies in bone length and movement variance by 18.76% and 5.48%, respectively, demonstrating significant gains in anatomical realism and motion naturalness.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) vary widely in their capabilities, with larger models often having better performance but higher cost: choosing an LLM model often involves trading off performance and cost. The LLM Cascade is a paradigm that defers difficult queries from weak/cheap to strong/expensive models. This approach is nonadaptive: the deferral decision is trained offline. When confronted with similar or repeated queries, the LLM Cascade may then repeatedly consult the expensive model and incur higher cost. To improve the cascading efficiency, we propose Inter-Cascade, an online and interactive LLM Cascade that extends the role of strong model from a backup helper to a long-term teacher. In our system, when a strong model resolves a difficult query, it also distills its solution into a generalized, reusable problem-solving strategy that boosts the weak model on subsequent queries. Adding strategies to queries enables the weak model to dynamically improve its performance over time, avoiding computationally and time-intensive fine-tuning. Empirically, compared with standard LLM Cascade baselines across multiple benchmarks, the Inter-Cascade significantly improves the accuracy of the weak model (by up to 33.06 absolute percentage points) and the overall system (by up to 5.53 absolute percentage points), while reducing the calls to strong models (by up to 48.05% relative reduction) and saving the corresponding fees (by up to 49.63% relative reduction). Inter-Cascade demonstrates the effective in-context knowledge transfer between LLMs, and provides a general, scalable framework applicable to both open-source and API-based LLMs.",

This geometry replaces a global ranking of LLMs with topical specialization and enables smooth variation across related questions. Building on this framework, our experimental results reveal that out-of-distribution behavior can be explained through directional alignment, and that larger norms consistently indicate harder questions. Moreover, JE-IRT naturally supports generalization: once the space is learned, new LLMs are added by fitting a single embedding. The learned space further reveals an LLM-internal taxonomy that only partially aligns with human-defined subject categories. JE-IRT thus establishes a unified and interpretable geometric lens that connects LLM abilities with the structure of questions, offering a distinctive perspective on model evaluation and generalization.",

In cancer, analysis of molecular signatures enables precision medicine through the identification of biological processes that drive individualized tumor progression, therapeutic resistance, and clinical heterogeneity. Recent advances in multimodal large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capacity to integrate and reason across heterogeneous data modalities. However, performing multi-modal language modeling for molecular understanding of patient-specific proteomics remains a significant challenge due to two barriers: (1) the lack of instruction-tuning datasets that enable clinical interpretation from proteomics data, and (2) the absence of language modeling architectures designed to capture the rich heterogeneity of molecular data. In this work, we introduce CPTAC-PROTSTRUCT, the first instruction tuning dataset for molecular understanding of oncology, comprising over 400k open-ended examples derived from individualized proteomic profiles curated from the largest national proteomics cancer study (CPTAC). Additionally, we propose KRONOS (Knowledge Representation of patient Omics Networks in Oncology via Structured tuning), a novel graph-LLM framework that leverages molecular interaction topology with proteomics to learn patient-specific graph representations for enhanced clinical reasoning. We show that KRONOS achieves competitive performance across benchmark clinical tasks, including molecular classification, temporal trajectory modeling, and tumor stage prediction from proteomics data. Ultimately, this approach empowers LLMs to understand patient-level pathogenesis, advancing precision medicine through more accurate diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment stratification.",

        "summary": "Margin-based optimization is fundamental to improving generalization and robustness in classification tasks. In the context of reward model learning from preferences within Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), existing methods typically rely on no margins, fixed margins, or margins that are simplistic functions of preference ratings. However, such formulations often fail to account for the varying strengths of different preferences, for example some preferences are associated with larger margins between responses, or they rely on noisy margin information derived from ratings. We argue that modeling the strength of preferences can lead to better generalization and more faithful alignment. Furthermore, many existing methods that use adaptive margins assume access to accurate preference scores, which can be difficult for humans to provide reliably. We propose an approach that leverages preferences over preferences, that is annotations indicating which of two preferences reflects a stronger distinction. We use this ordinal signal to infer adaptive margins on a per-datapoint basis. We introduce an extension to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), DPO-PoP, that incorporates adaptive margins from preference-over-preference supervision, enabling improved discriminative and generative performance. Empirically, our method outperforms vanilla DPO, DPO with fixed margins, and DPO with ground-truth margins on the UltraFeedback dataset. Additionally, we show that there is a tradeoff between discriminative and generative performance: improving test classification accuracy, particularly by correctly labeling weaker preferences at the expense of stronger ones, can lead to a decline in generative quality. To navigate this tradeoff, we propose two sampling strategies to gather preference-over-preference labels: one favoring discriminative performance and one favoring generative performance.",

        "summary": "Research on Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly focuses on identifying mechanistic explanations for their behaviors, yet the field lacks clear principles for determining when (and how) findings from one model instance generalize to another. This paper addresses a fundamental epistemological challenge: given a mechanistic claim about a particular model, what justifies extrapolating this finding to other LLMs -- and along which dimensions might such generalizations hold? I propose five potential axes of correspondence along which mechanistic claims might generalize, including: functional (whether they satisfy the same functional criteria), developmental (whether they develop at similar points during pretraining), positional (whether they occupy similar absolute or relative positions), relational (whether they interact with other model components in similar ways), and configurational (whether they correspond to particular regions or structures in weight-space). To empirically validate this framework, I analyze \"1-back attention heads\" (components attending to previous tokens) across pretraining in random seeds of the Pythia models (14M, 70M, 160M, 410M). The results reveal striking consistency in the developmental trajectories of 1-back attention across models, while positional consistency is more limited. Moreover, seeds of larger models systematically show earlier onsets, steeper slopes, and higher peaks of 1-back attention. I also address possible objections to the arguments and proposals outlined here. Finally, I conclude by arguing that progress on the generalizability of mechanistic interpretability research will consist in mapping constitutive design properties of LLMs to their emergent behaviors and mechanisms.",

Our theoretical analyses reveal that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) may introduce co-occurrence-based spurious solutions, whereas RL achieves correct planning primarily through exploration, underscoring exploration's role in enabling better generalization. However, we also show that PG suffers from diversity collapse, where output diversity decreases during training and persists even after perfect accuracy is attained. By contrast, Q-learning provides two key advantages: off-policy learning and diversity preservation at convergence. We further demonstrate that careful reward design is necessary to prevent reward hacking in Q-learning.

Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless, CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process. Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of predictive performance.",

Token eviction, a widely adopted post-training methodology designed to alleviate the bottlenecks by evicting less important tokens from the cache, typically uses attention scores as proxy metrics for token importance. However, one major limitation of attention score as a token-wise importance metrics is that it lacks the information about contribution of tokens to the attention output. In this paper, we propose a simple eviction criterion based on the contribution of cached tokens to attention outputs. Our method, CAOTE, optimizes for eviction error due to token eviction, by seamlessly integrating attention scores and value vectors. This is the first method which uses value vector information on top of attention-based eviction scores. Additionally, CAOTE can act as a meta-heuristic method with flexible usage with any token eviction method. We show that CAOTE, when combined with the state-of-the-art attention score-based methods, always improves accuracies on the downstream task, indicating the importance of leveraging information from values during token eviction process.",

Despite significant progress in Novel View Synthesis powered by NeRF and 3DGS, current approaches remain reliant on accurate 3D attributes (e.g., camera poses and point clouds) acquired from Structure-from-Motion (SfM), which is often slow and fragile in low-texture or low-overlap captures. Recent 3DFMs showcase orders of magnitude speedup over the traditional pipeline and great potential for online NVS. But most of the validation and conclusions are confined to sparse-view settings. Our study reveals that naively scaling 3DFMs to dense views encounters two fundamental barriers: dramatically increasing VRAM burden and imperfect outputs that degrade initialization-sensitive 3D training. To address these barriers, we introduce VGGT-X, incorporating a memory-efficient VGGT implementation that scales to 1,000+ images, an adaptive global alignment for VGGT output enhancement, and robust 3DGS training practices. Extensive experiments show that these measures substantially close the fidelity gap with COLMAP-initialized pipelines, achieving state-of-the-art results in dense COLMAP-free NVS and pose estimation.

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning based post-training has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing the alignment and reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While vision-centric post-training is crucial for enhancing MLLMs' intrinsic understanding of visual signals, current post-training paradigms are predominantly text-centric, where dense visual inputs are only leveraged to extract sparse cues for text-based reasoning. There exist a few approaches in this direction, however, they often still rely on text as an intermediate mediator or introduce additional visual generative designs. In this work, we introduce Visual Jigsaw, a generic self-supervised post-training framework designed to strengthen visual understanding in MLLMs. Visual Jigsaw is formulated as a general ordering task: visual inputs are partitioned, shuffled, and the model must reconstruct the visual information by producing the correct permutation in natural language. This naturally aligns with reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), requires no additional visual generative components, and derives its supervisory signal automatically without any annotations. We instantiate Visual Jigsaw across three visual modalities, including images, videos, and 3D data. Extensive experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in fine-grained perception, temporal reasoning, and 3D spatial understanding. Our findings highlight the potential of self-supervised vision-centric tasks in post-training MLLMs and aim to inspire further research on vision-centric pretext designs.

In this work, we further clarify that conditional image leakage leads to overfitting to in-domain data and decreases the performance in out-of-domain scenarios. Moreover, we introduce Fourier-Guided Latent Shifting I2V, named FlashI2V, to prevent conditional image leakage. Concretely, FlashI2V consists of: (1) Latent Shifting. We modify the source and target distributions of flow matching by subtracting the conditional image information from the noisy latents, thereby incorporating the condition implicitly. (2) Fourier Guidance. We use high-frequency magnitude features obtained by the Fourier Transform to accelerate convergence and enable the adjustment of detail levels in the generated video. Experimental results show that our method effectively overcomes conditional image leakage and achieves the best generalization and performance on out-of-domain data among various I2V paradigms. With only 1.3B parameters, FlashI2V achieves a dynamic degree score of 53.01 on Vbench-I2V, surpassing CogVideoX1.5-5B-I2V and Wan2.1-I2V-14B-480P.

        "summary": "Structured images (e.g., charts and geometric diagrams) remain challenging for multimodal large language models (MLLMs), as perceptual slips can cascade into erroneous conclusions. Intermediate visual cues can steer reasoning; however, existing cue-based methods are constrained with low-fidelity image processing and linear, rigid reasoning patterns, limiting their effectiveness on complex structured-image tasks. In this paper, we propose PixelCraft, a novel multi-agent system for high-fidelity image processing and flexible visual reasoning on structured images. The system comprises a dispatcher, a planner, a reasoner, critics, and a set of visual tool agents. To achieve high-fidelity processing, we construct a high-quality corpus and fine-tune an MLLM into a grounding model, whose pixel-level localizations are integrated with traditional computer vision (CV) algorithms in tool agents. Building on this foundation, PixelCraft facilitates flexible visual reasoning through a dynamic three-stage workflow of tool selection, agent discussion, and self-criticism. Moreover, unlike prior linear reasoning patterns that simply append historical images, PixelCraft maintains an image memory to allow the planner to adaptively revisit earlier visual steps, explore alternative reasoning branches, and dynamically adjust the reasoning trajectory during discussion. Extensive experiments on challenging chart and geometry benchmarks demonstrate that PixelCraft significantly improves visual reasoning performance for advanced MLLMs, setting a new standard for structured image reasoning.

Unlike existing approaches, PAD3R handles long video sequences featuring substantial object deformation, large-scale camera movement, and limited view coverage that typically challenge conventional systems. At its core, our approach trains a personalized, object-centric pose estimator, supervised by a pre-trained image-to-3D model. This guides the optimization of deformable 3D Gaussian representation. The optimization is further regularized by long-term 2D point tracking over the entire input video. By combining generative priors and differentiable rendering, PAD3R reconstructs high-fidelity, articulated 3D representations of objects in a category-agnostic way. Extensive qualitative and quantitative results show that PAD3R is robust and generalizes well across challenging scenarios, highlighting its potential for dynamic scene understanding and 3D content creation.",

        "summary": "Existing text-to-image diffusion models excel at generating high-quality images, but face significant efficiency challenges when scaled to high resolutions, like 4K image generation. While previous research accelerates diffusion models in various aspects, it seldom handles the inherent redundancy within the latent space. To bridge this gap, this paper introduces DC-Gen, a general framework that accelerates text-to-image diffusion models by leveraging a deeply compressed latent space. Rather than a costly training-from-scratch approach, DC-Gen uses an efficient post-training pipeline to preserve the quality of the base model. A key challenge in this paradigm is the representation gap between the base model's latent space and a deeply compressed latent space, which can lead to instability during direct fine-tuning. To overcome this, DC-Gen first bridges the representation gap with a lightweight embedding alignment training. Once the latent embeddings are aligned, only a small amount of LoRA fine-tuning is needed to unlock the base model's inherent generation quality. We verify DC-Gen's effectiveness on SANA and FLUX.1-Krea. The resulting DC-Gen-SANA and DC-Gen-FLUX models achieve quality comparable to their base models but with a significant speedup. Specifically, DC-Gen-FLUX reduces the latency of 4K image generation by 53x on the NVIDIA H100 GPU. When combined with NVFP4 SVDQuant, DC-Gen-FLUX generates a 4K image in just 3.5 seconds on a single NVIDIA 5090 GPU, achieving a total latency reduction of 138x compared to the base FLUX.1-Krea model.

        "summary": "Object hallucination in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) is a persistent failure mode that causes the model to perceive objects absent in the image. This weakness of MLLMs is currently studied using static benchmarks with fixed visual scenarios, which preempts the possibility of uncovering model-specific or unanticipated hallucination vulnerabilities. We introduce GHOST (Generating Hallucinations via Optimizing Stealth Tokens), a method designed to stress-test MLLMs by actively generating images that induce hallucination. GHOST is fully automatic and requires no human supervision or prior knowledge. It operates by optimizing in the image embedding space to mislead the model while keeping the target object absent, and then guiding a diffusion model conditioned on the embedding to generate natural-looking images. The resulting images remain visually natural and close to the original input, yet introduce subtle misleading cues that cause the model to hallucinate. We evaluate our method across a range of models, including reasoning models like GLM-4.1V-Thinking, and achieve a hallucination success rate exceeding 28%, compared to around 1% in prior data-driven discovery methods. We confirm that the generated images are both high-quality and object-free through quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Also, GHOST uncovers transferable vulnerabilities: images optimized for Qwen2.5-VL induce hallucinations in GPT-4o at a 66.5% rate. Finally, we show that fine-tuning on our images mitigates hallucination, positioning GHOST as both a diagnostic and corrective tool for building more reliable multimodal systems.",

Our design is motivated by the observation that shallow visual features are much more likely than deep visual features to cause an MLLM to hallucinate as they only capture biased, low-level information that is insufficient for high-level reasoning. Therefore, LayerCD aims to filter out hallucinations by contrasting the output distributions generated from visual features of different levels, specifically those from the shallow and deep layers of the vision encoder, respectively. We conduct extensive experiments on two hallucination benchmarks and show that LayerCD significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art.

Existing personalization approaches rely on costly fine-tuning or synthetic data pipelines, which are inflexible and restricted to fixed task formats. Visual in-context learning (ICL) offers a promising alternative, yet prior methods confine to narrow, in-domain tasks and fail to generalize to open-ended personalization. We introduce Personalized In-Context Operator (PICO), a simple four-panel framework that repurposes diffusion transformers as visual in-context learners. Given a single annotated exemplar, PICO infers the underlying transformation and applies it to new inputs without retraining. To enable this, we construct VisRel, a compact yet diverse tuning dataset, showing that task diversity, rather than scale, drives robust generalization. We further propose an attention-guided seed scorer that improves reliability via efficient inference scaling. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PICO (i) surpasses fine-tuning and synthetic-data baselines, (ii) flexibly adapts to novel user-defined tasks, and (iii) generalizes across both recognition and generation.",

We introduce a three-stage alignment strategy: (1) freeze the encoder and train an adapter and a decoder to establish a semantic latent space; (2) jointly optimize all components with an additional semantic preservation loss, enabling the encoder to capture perceptual details while retaining high-level semantics; and (3) refine the decoder for improved reconstruction quality. This alignment yields semantically rich image tokenizers that benefit diffusion models. On ImageNet 256$\\times$256, our tokenizer accelerates the convergence of diffusion models, reaching a gFID of 1.90 within just 64 epochs, and improves generation both with and without classifier-free guidance. Scaling to LAION, a 2B-parameter text-to-image model trained with our tokenizer consistently outperforms FLUX VAE under the same training steps. Overall, our method is simple, scalable, and establishes a semantically grounded paradigm for continuous tokenizer design.",

However, most existing work suffers from severe error accumulation that often significantly degrades the generated stream videos over long horizons. We design Rolling Forcing, a novel video generation technique that enables streaming long videos with minimal error accumulation. Rolling Forcing comes with three novel designs. First, instead of iteratively sampling individual frames, which accelerates error propagation, we design a joint denoising scheme that simultaneously denoises multiple frames with progressively increasing noise levels. This design relaxes the strict causality across adjacent frames, effectively suppressing error growth. Second, we introduce the attention sink mechanism into the long-horizon stream video generation task, which allows the model to keep key value states of initial frames as a global context anchor and thereby enhances long-term global consistency. Third, we design an efficient training algorithm that enables few-step distillation over largely extended denoising windows. This algorithm operates on non-overlapping windows and mitigates exposure bias conditioned on self-generated histories. Extensive experiments show that Rolling Forcing enables real-time streaming generation of multi-minute videos on a single GPU, with substantially reduced error accumulation.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models achieve high-quality image generation but are limited by slow iterative sampling. Distillation methods alleviate this by enabling one- or few-step generation. Flow matching, originally introduced as a distinct framework, has since been shown to be theoretically equivalent to diffusion under Gaussian assumptions, raising the question of whether distillation techniques such as score distillation transfer directly. We provide a simple derivation -- based on Bayes' rule and conditional expectations -- that unifies Gaussian diffusion and flow matching without relying on ODE/SDE formulations. Building on this view, we extend Score identity Distillation (SiD) to pretrained text-to-image flow-matching models, including SANA, SD3-Medium, SD3.5-Medium/Large, and FLUX.1-dev, all with DiT backbones. Experiments show that, with only modest flow-matching- and DiT-specific adjustments, SiD works out of the box across these models, in both data-free and data-aided settings, without requiring teacher finetuning or architectural changes. This provides the first systematic evidence that score distillation applies broadly to text-to-image flow matching models, resolving prior concerns about stability and soundness and unifying acceleration techniques across diffusion- and flow-based generators.

        "summary": "Reconstructing 3D scenes and synthesizing novel views has seen rapid progress in recent years. Neural Radiance Fields demonstrated that continuous volumetric radiance fields can achieve high-quality image synthesis, but their long training and rendering times limit practicality. 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) addressed these issues by representing scenes with millions of Gaussians, enabling real-time rendering and fast optimization. However, Gaussian primitives are not natively compatible with the mesh-based pipelines used in VR headsets, and real-time graphics applications. Existing solutions attempt to convert Gaussians into meshes through post-processing or two-stage pipelines, which increases complexity and degrades visual quality. In this work, we introduce Triangle Splatting+, which directly optimizes triangles, the fundamental primitive of computer graphics, within a differentiable splatting framework. We formulate triangle parametrization to enable connectivity through shared vertices, and we design a training strategy that enforces opaque triangles. The final output is immediately usable in standard graphics engines without post-processing. Experiments on the Mip-NeRF360 and Tanks & Temples datasets show that Triangle Splatting+achieves state-of-the-art performance in mesh-based novel view synthesis.

        "summary": "Adversarial purification with diffusion models has emerged as a promising defense strategy, but existing methods typically rely on uniform noise injection, which indiscriminately perturbs all frequencies, corrupting semantic structures and undermining robustness. Our empirical study reveals that adversarial perturbations are not uniformly distributed: they are predominantly concentrated in high-frequency regions, with heterogeneous magnitude intensity patterns that vary across frequencies and attack types. Motivated by this observation, we introduce MANI-Pure, a magnitude-adaptive purification framework that leverages the magnitude spectrum of inputs to guide the purification process. Instead of injecting homogeneous noise, MANI-Pure adaptively applies heterogeneous, frequency-targeted noise, effectively suppressing adversarial perturbations in fragile high-frequency, low-magnitude bands while preserving semantically critical low-frequency content. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-1K validate the effectiveness of MANI-Pure. It narrows the clean accuracy gap to within 0.59 of the original classifier, while boosting robust accuracy by 2.15, and achieves the top-1 robust accuracy on the RobustBench leaderboard, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art method.",

        "summary": "High-fidelity 3D asset generation is crucial for various industries. While recent 3D pretrained models show strong capability in producing realistic content, most are built upon diffusion models and follow a two-stage pipeline that first generates geometry and then synthesizes appearance. Such a decoupled design tends to produce geometry-texture misalignment and non-negligible cost. In this paper, we propose UniLat3D, a unified framework that encodes geometry and appearance in a single latent space, enabling direct single-stage generation. Our key contribution is a geometry-appearance Unified VAE, which compresses high-resolution sparse features into a compact latent representation -- UniLat. UniLat integrates structural and visual information into a dense low-resolution latent, which can be efficiently decoded into diverse 3D formats, e.g., 3D Gaussians and meshes. Based on this unified representation, we train a single flow-matching model to map Gaussian noise directly into UniLat, eliminating redundant stages. Trained solely on public datasets, UniLat3D produces high-quality 3D assets in seconds from a single image, achieving superior appearance fidelity and geometric quality.

        "summary": "Cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) has become a central tool for high-resolution structural biology, yet the massive scale of datasets (often exceeding 100k particle images) renders 3D reconstruction both computationally expensive and memory intensive. Traditional Fourier-space methods are efficient but lose fidelity due to repeated transforms, while recent real-space approaches based on neural radiance fields (NeRFs) improve accuracy but incur cubic memory and computation overhead. Therefore, we introduce GEM, a novel cryo-EM reconstruction framework built on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) that operates directly in real-space while maintaining high efficiency. Instead of modeling the entire density volume, GEM represents proteins with compact 3D Gaussians, each parameterized by only 11 values. To further improve the training efficiency, we designed a novel gradient computation to 3D Gaussians that contribute to each voxel. This design substantially reduced both memory footprint and training cost. On standard cryo-EM benchmarks, GEM achieves up to 48% faster training and 12% lower memory usage compared to state-of-the-art methods, while improving local resolution by as much as 38.8%. These results establish GEM as a practical and scalable paradigm for cryo-EM reconstruction, unifying speed, efficiency, and high-resolution accuracy.

We demonstrate unprecedented capabilities by performing multimodal registration of a 100 micron ex-vivo human brain MRI volume at native resolution - an inverse problem more than 570x larger than a standard clinical datum in about a minute using only 8 A6000 GPUs. FFDP accelerates existing state-of-the-art optimization and deep learning registration pipelines by upto 6 - 7x while reducing peak memory consumption by 20 - 59%. Comparative analysis on a 250 micron dataset shows that FFDP can fit upto 64x larger problems than existing SOTA on a single GPU, and highlights both the performance and efficiency gains of FFDP compared to SOTA image registration methods.",

        "summary": "Few-shot learning (FSL) aims to recognize novel concepts from only a few labeled support samples. Recent studies enhance support features by incorporating additional semantic information or designing complex semantic fusion modules. However, they still suffer from hallucinating semantics that contradict the visual evidence due to the lack of grounding in actual instances, resulting in noisy guidance and costly corrections. To address these issues, we propose a novel framework, bridging Vision and Text with LLMs for Few-Shot Learning (VT-FSL), which constructs precise cross-modal prompts conditioned on Large Language Models (LLMs) and support images, seamlessly integrating them through a geometry-aware alignment. It mainly consists of Cross-modal Iterative Prompting (CIP) and Cross-modal Geometric Alignment (CGA). Specifically, the CIP conditions an LLM on both class names and support images to generate precise class descriptions iteratively in a single structured reasoning pass. These descriptions not only enrich the semantic understanding of novel classes but also enable the zero-shot synthesis of semantically consistent images. The descriptions and synthetic images act respectively as complementary textual and visual prompts, providing high-level class semantics and low-level intra-class diversity to compensate for limited support data. Furthermore, the CGA jointly aligns the fused textual, support, and synthetic visual representations by minimizing the kernelized volume of the 3-dimensional parallelotope they span. It captures global and nonlinear relationships among all representations, enabling structured and consistent multimodal integration. The proposed VT-FSL method establishes new state-of-the-art performance across ten diverse benchmarks, including standard, cross-domain, and fine-grained few-shot learning scenarios.

The instability of the training process easily disrupts the pretrained model capability during long runs, resulting in marginal gains, degraded image quality, and poor generalization. In this work, we revisit GRPO for AR image generation and identify two key issues: contradictory gradients from unnecessary tokens and unstable policy entropy dynamics. To address these, we introduce STAGE, a stable and generalizable framework that leverages two targeted solutions: 1) Advantage/KL reweighting. Similarity-aware reweighting to alleviate conflicting updates; and 2) Entropy reward. An entropy-based reward corresponding to reference model to stabilize learning. With the help of alleviating conflicts between tokens and an entropy reward for stabilizing training, we reduce disruption of the pretrained distribution and mitigate reward hacking, which in turn improves generalization and transfer better to other benchmarks. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that STAGE consistently improves visual quality, stability, and cross-task generalization compared to baseline GRPO.",

Motivated by the insight that spatially nearby views provide more useful signal about the local scene composition than distant views, our model processes all information in a local neighborhood around each view. To attend to tokens in nearby views, we leverage a novel positional encoding that conditions on the relative geometric transformation between the query and nearby views. We decode the output of our model into a 3D Gaussian Splat scene representation that includes both color and opacity view-dependence.

To address this, we propose PanoWorld-X, a novel framework for high-fidelity and controllable panoramic video generation with diverse camera trajectories. Specifically, we first construct a large-scale dataset of panoramic video-exploration route pairs by simulating camera trajectories in virtual 3D environments via Unreal Engine. As the spherical geometry of panoramic data misaligns with the inductive priors from conventional video diffusion, we then introduce a Sphere-Aware Diffusion Transformer architecture that reprojects equirectangular features onto the spherical surface to model geometric adjacency in latent space, significantly enhancing visual fidelity and spatiotemporal continuity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our PanoWorld-X achieves superior performance in various aspects, including motion range, control precision, and visual quality, underscoring its potential for real-world applications.",

While recent works such as Marigold~\\citep{ke2024repurposing} and Lotus~\\citep{he2024lotus} adapt diffusion priors for dense prediction with strong cross-domain generalization, their potential for structured outputs (e.g., human pose estimation) remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose \\textbf{SDPose}, a fine-tuning framework built upon Stable Diffusion to fully exploit pre-trained diffusion priors for human pose estimation. First, rather than modifying cross-attention modules or introducing learnable embeddings, we directly predict keypoint heatmaps in the SD U-Net's image latent space to preserve the original generative priors. Second, we map these latent features into keypoint heatmaps through a lightweight convolutional pose head, which avoids disrupting the pre-trained backbone. Finally, to prevent overfitting and enhance out-of-distribution robustness, we incorporate an auxiliary RGB reconstruction branch that preserves domain-transferable generative semantics. To evaluate robustness under domain shift, we further construct \\textbf{COCO-OOD}, a style-transferred variant of COCO with preserved annotations. With just one-fifth of the training schedule used by Sapiens on COCO, SDPose attains parity with Sapiens-1B/2B on the COCO validation set and establishes a new state of the art on the cross-domain benchmarks HumanArt and COCO-OOD.

BraTS 2025 Task 1 addresses this by challenging models to generalize across varying tumor appearances throughout the treatment timeline. However, training such generalized models requires access to diverse, high-quality annotated data, which is often limited. While data augmentation can alleviate this, storing large volumes of augmented 3D data is computationally expensive. To address these challenges, we propose an on-the-fly augmentation strategy that dynamically inserts synthetic tumors using pretrained generative adversarial networks (GliGANs) during training. We evaluate three nnU-Net-based models and their ensembles: (1) a baseline without external augmentation, (2) a regular on-the-fly augmented model, and (3) a model with customized on-the-fly augmentation. Built upon the nnU-Net framework, our pipeline leverages pretrained GliGAN weights and tumor insertion methods from prior challenge-winning solutions. An ensemble of the three models achieves lesion-wise Dice scores of 0.79 (ET), 0.749 (NETC), 0.872 (RC), 0.825 (SNFH), 0.79 (TC), and 0.88 (WT) on the online BraTS 2025 validation platform.

        "summary": "Understanding how people interact with their surroundings and each other is essential for enabling robots to act in socially compliant and context-aware ways. While 3D Scene Graphs have emerged as a powerful semantic representation for scene understanding, existing approaches largely ignore humans in the scene, also due to the lack of annotated human-environment relationships. Moreover, existing methods typically capture only open-vocabulary relations from single image frames, which limits their ability to model long-range interactions beyond the observed content. We introduce Social 3D Scene Graphs, an augmented 3D Scene Graph representation that captures humans, their attributes, activities and relationships in the environment, both local and remote, using an open-vocabulary framework. Furthermore, we introduce a new benchmark consisting of synthetic environments with comprehensive human-scene relationship annotations and diverse types of queries for evaluating social scene understanding in 3D. The experiments demonstrate that our representation improves human activity prediction and reasoning about human-environment relations, paving the way toward socially intelligent robots.",

This work evaluates the effectiveness of Temperature Scaling (TS), a post-hoc calibration technique, in improving the reliability of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for brain tumor classification. We develop a custom CNN and train it on a merged brain MRI dataset. To simulate real-world uncertainty, five types of image noise are introduced: Gaussian, Poisson, Salt & Pepper, Speckle, and Uniform. Model performance is evaluated using precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, negative log-likelihood (NLL), and expected calibration error (ECE), both before and after calibration. Results demonstrate that TS significantly reduces ECE and NLL under all noise conditions without degrading classification accuracy. This underscores TS as an effective and computationally efficient approach to enhance decision confidence of medical AI systems, hence making model outputs more reliable in noisy or uncertain settings.",

Specifically, MGPA mimics human visual divergent and focused attention to capture task-related information, while VERA verifies perceived key clues to mitigate hallucination and optimize subsequent perception strategies. Through this interactive process, CogniGPT explores a minimal set of informative and reliable task-related clues. Extensive experiments on EgoSchema, Video-MME, NExT-QA, and MovieChat datasets demonstrate CogniGPT's superiority in both accuracy and efficiency.

We investigate the scalability of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) through two design choices that have proven to be effective in other types of generative models: training in a compact Variational Autoencoder latent space and adopting purely transformer-based generators and discriminators. Training in latent space enables efficient computation while preserving perceptual fidelity, and this efficiency pairs naturally with plain transformers, whose performance scales with computational budget. Building on these choices, we analyze failure modes that emerge when naively scaling GANs. Specifically, we find issues as underutilization of early layers in the generator and optimization instability as the network scales. Accordingly, we provide simple and scale-friendly solutions as lightweight intermediate supervision and width-aware learning-rate adjustment. Our experiments show that GAT, a purely transformer-based and latent-space GANs, can be easily trained reliably across a wide range of capacities (S through XL). Moreover, GAT-XL/2 achieves state-of-the-art single-step, class-conditional generation performance (FID of 2.96) on ImageNet-256 in just 40 epochs, 6x fewer epochs than strong baselines.",

Specifically, SID learns an initial agent on the shortest-path data sampled from environments and then leverages this agent to generate novel exploration trajectories. The novel rollouts provide demonstrations with stronger exploration strategies to train a better agent, which in turn produces higher-quality agent demonstrations for the next round of training. We show that this iterative self-improving pipeline readily scales to new environments, and the resulting demonstrations can be transferred across a variety of language-guided navigation tasks, elevating the performance ceiling in diverse goal-oriented navigation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SID significantly boosts the exploration capabilities and generalization of navigation agents. The resulting agent achieves new state-of-the-art performance on goal-oriented language-guided navigation tasks, including REVERIE, SOON, notably achieving a 50.9% success rate on the unseen validation splits of SOON, surpassing the prior leading approaches by a margin of 13.9%.",

The Cobb angle serves as the gold standard for AIS severity assessment, yet traditional manual measurements suffer from significant observer variability, compromising diagnostic accuracy. Despite prior automation attempts, existing methods use simplified spinal models and predetermined curve patterns that fail to address clinical complexity. We present a novel deep learning framework for AIS assessment that simultaneously predicts both superior and inferior endplate angles with corresponding midpoint coordinates for each vertebra, preserving the anatomical reality of vertebral wedging in progressive AIS. Our approach combines an HRNet backbone with Swin-Transformer modules and biomechanically informed constraints for enhanced feature extraction. We employ Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to analyze angle predictions directly from vertebral morphology, enabling flexible detection of diverse scoliosis patterns without predefined curve assumptions. Using 630 full-spine anteroposterior radiographs from patients aged 10-18 years with rigorous dual-rater annotation, our method achieved 83.45% diagnostic accuracy and 2.55{\\deg} mean absolute error. The framework demonstrates exceptional generalization capability on out-of-distribution cases. Additionally, we introduce the Vertebral Wedging Index (VWI), a novel metric quantifying vertebral deformation. Longitudinal analysis revealed VWI's significant prognostic correlation with curve progression while traditional Cobb angles showed no correlation, providing robust support for early AIS detection, personalized treatment planning, and progression monitoring.",

To address these issues, we propose DWGS, a novel unified framework that enhances 3DGS for sparse-view synthesis by integrating robust structural cues, virtual view constraints, and occluded region completion. Our approach introduces three principal contributions: a Hybrid-Loss Depth Estimation module that leverages dense matching priors with reprojection, point propagation, and smoothness constraints to enforce multi-view consistency; a Bidirectional Warping Virtual View Synthesis method generates virtual training views to impose stronger geometric and photometric constraints; and an Occlusion-Aware Reconstruction component that utilizes depth-difference mask and a learning-based inpainting model to recover obscured regions.

Attack efficacy is evaluated using a custom proxy metric, while stealth is analyzed through perceptual and frequency domain measures. The transferability of the method to a modern diffusion based pipeline is further examined through ControlNet guided editing. Interestingly, the experiments show that poisoned outputs can display higher visual quality compared to clean counterparts, challenging the assumption that poisoning necessarily reduces fidelity. Unlike conventional pixel level perturbations, latent space poisoning in GANs and diffusion pipelines can retain or even enhance output aesthetics, exposing a blind spot in pixel level defenses.

In this study, we propose ThermalGen, an adaptive flow-based generative model for RGB-T image translation, incorporating an RGB image conditioning architecture and a style-disentangled mechanism.

Extensive evaluations across multiple RGB-T benchmarks demonstrate that ThermalGen achieves comparable or superior translation performance compared to existing GAN-based and diffusion-based methods.

Although not straightforward, their recent application to the field of remote sensing signaled the first successful trials towards harnessing the large volume of publicly available datasets containing multimodal information. Despite their success, existing methods face considerable limitations: they rely on limited environmental context, struggle with missing or corrupted data, and often fail to reliably reflect user intentions in generated outputs. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion model conditioned on environmental context, that is able to generate satellite images by conditioning from any combination of three different control signals: a) text, b) metadata, and c) visual data. In contrast to previous works, the proposed method is i) to our knowledge, the first of its kind to condition satellite image generation on dynamic environmental conditions as part of its control signals, and ii) incorporating a metadata fusion strategy that models attribute embedding interactions to account for partially corrupt and/or missing observations. Our method outperforms previous methods both qualitatively (robustness to missing metadata, higher responsiveness to control inputs) and quantitatively (higher fidelity, accuracy, and quality of generations measured using 6 different metrics) in the trials of single-image and temporal generation. The reported results support our hypothesis that conditioning on environmental context can improve the performance of foundation models for satellite imagery, and render our model a promising candidate for usage in downstream tasks. The collected 3-modal dataset is to our knowledge, the first publicly-available dataset to combine data from these three different mediums.",

To address these challenges, we propose StreamForest, a novel architecture specifically designed for streaming video understanding. Central to StreamForest is the Persistent Event Memory Forest, a memory mechanism that adaptively organizes video frames into multiple event-level tree structures. This process is guided by penalty functions based on temporal distance, content similarity, and merge frequency, enabling efficient long-term memory retention under limited computational resources. To enhance real-time perception, we introduce a Fine-grained Spatiotemporal Window, which captures detailed short-term visual cues to improve current scene perception. Additionally, we present OnlineIT, an instruction-tuning dataset tailored for streaming video tasks. OnlineIT significantly boosts MLLM performance in both real-time perception and future prediction. To evaluate generalization in practical applications, we introduce ODV-Bench, a new benchmark focused on real-time streaming video understanding in autonomous driving scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that StreamForest achieves the state-of-the-art performance, with accuracies of 77.3% on StreamingBench, 60.5% on OVBench, and 55.6% on OVO-Bench. In particular, even under extreme visual token compression (limited to 1024 tokens), the model retains 96.8% of its average accuracy in eight benchmarks relative to the default setting. These results underscore the robustness, efficiency, and generalizability of StreamForest for streaming video understanding.",

Ablation shows that removing any module lowers F1 by up to 4.35, confirming their complementary value.

Diversity-based methods improve robustness by selecting tokens far apart in feature space but risk dropping regions needed for accurate prediction. We propose \\ours, a training-free framework built on a simple intuition: tokens with higher sensitivity are more likely to influence the model's output, and they should also capture complementary visual cues rather than overlapping information. To achieve this, we estimate token sensitivity using zeroth-order perturbations at the projection layer, a shallow and computationally light component of the model. This approach measures how small random perturbations affect the projection outputs, allowing us to approximate each token's influence through lightweight forward passes without backpropagation. Extensive experiments across multiple VLMs and benchmarks show that \\ours consistently outperforms prior methods, pruning up to 94.4\\% of tokens while maintaining accuracy and significantly improving efficiency, achieving up to 2.30x faster end-to-end inference over the baseline.",

Unlike previous approaches that require \"clean\" inputs (e.g., full-body images with minimal occlusions, or well-calibrated cross-view captures), UP2You directly processes raw, unstructured photographs, which may vary significantly in pose, viewpoint, cropping, and occlusion. Instead of compressing data into tokens for slow online text-to-3D optimization, we introduce a data rectifier paradigm that efficiently converts unconstrained inputs into clean, orthogonal multi-view images in a single forward pass within seconds, simplifying the 3D reconstruction. Central to UP2You is a pose-correlated feature aggregation module (PCFA), that selectively fuses information from multiple reference images w.r.t. target poses, enabling better identity preservation and nearly constant memory footprint, with more observations. We also introduce a perceiver-based multi-reference shape predictor, removing the need for pre-captured body templates. Extensive experiments on 4D-Dress, PuzzleIOI, and in-the-wild captures demonstrate that UP2You consistently surpasses previous methods in both geometric accuracy (Chamfer-15%, P2S-18% on PuzzleIOI) and texture fidelity (PSNR-21%, LPIPS-46% on 4D-Dress). UP2You is efficient (1.5 minutes per person), and versatile (supports arbitrary pose control, and training-free multi-garment 3D virtual try-on), making it practical for real-world scenarios where humans are casually captured.

Although deep learning methods applied to point clouds sampled on CAD models of the objects and/or captured by LiDAR or RGBD cameras have achieved remarkable success in recent years, achieving high classification accuracy remains a challenging problem due to the unordered point clouds and their irregularity and noise. To this end, we propose a novel state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D object classification technique that combines topological data analysis with various image filtration techniques to classify objects when they are represented using point clouds. We transform every point cloud into a voxelized binary 3D image to extract distinguishing topological features.

Our framework, TACO-Net, sets a new state-of-the-art by achieving $99.05\\%$ and $99.52\\%$ accuracy on the widely used synthetic benchmarks ModelNet40 and ModelNet10, and further demonstrates its robustness on the large-scale real-world OmniObject3D dataset.

        "summary": "This study identifies that visual-related functional decoding is distributed across different decoder layers in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Typically, each function, such as counting, grounding, or OCR recognition, narrows down to two or three layers, which we define as Vision Function Layers (VFL). Additionally, the depth and its order of different VFLs exhibits a consistent pattern across different MLLMs, which is well-aligned with human behaviors (e.g., recognition occurs first, followed by counting, and then grounding). These findings are derived from Visual Token Swapping, our novel analytical framework that modifies targeted KV cache entries to precisely elucidate layer-specific functions during decoding. Furthermore, these insights offer substantial utility in tailoring MLLMs for real-world downstream applications. For instance, when LoRA training is selectively applied to VFLs whose functions align with the training data, VFL-LoRA not only outperform full-LoRA but also prevent out-of-domain function forgetting. Moreover, by analyzing the performance differential on training data when particular VFLs are ablated, VFL-select automatically classifies data by function, enabling highly efficient data selection to directly bolster corresponding capabilities. Consequently, VFL-select surpasses human experts in data selection, and achieves 98% of full-data performance with only 20% of the original dataset. This study delivers deeper comprehension of MLLM visual processing, fostering the creation of more efficient, interpretable, and robust models.",

LVLMs with a uniform frame sampling mechanism, which samples frames with an equal frame size and fixed sampling rate, inevitably sacrifice either temporal clues or spatial details, resulting in suboptimal solutions. To mitigate this dilemma, we propose LOVE-R1, a model that can adaptively zoom in on a video clip. The model is first provided with densely sampled frames but in a small resolution. If some spatial details are needed, the model can zoom in on a clip of interest with a large frame resolution based on its reasoning until key visual information is obtained. The whole process is implemented as a multi-step reasoning process. To train the reasoning ability, we first finetune the model on our collected 38k high-quality CoT data and enhance it with decoupled reinforcement finetuning. As outcome rewards can not provide fine-grained process supervision, we decouple multi-step reasoning into multiple single-step reasoning and optimize the internal zoom-in ability explicitly. Experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that our model with the slow-fast adaptive frame sampling mechanism achieves a great trade-off between sampling density and frame resolutions, and LOVE-R1 outperforms our baseline Qwen2.5-VL by an average of 3.1% points across 4 common long video understanding benchmarks.",

Existing compression methods either rely on costly optimization, which is slow and scene-specific, or adopt training-free pruning and quantization, which degrade rendering quality under high compression ratios. In contrast, recent data-driven approaches provide a promising direction to overcome this trade-off, enabling efficient compression while preserving high rendering quality. We introduce \\textbf{ExGS}, a novel feed-forward framework that unifies \\textbf{Universal Gaussian Compression} (UGC) with \\textbf{GaussPainter} for \\textbf{Ex}treme 3D\\textbf{GS} compression. \\textbf{UGC} performs re-optimization-free pruning to aggressively reduce Gaussian primitives while retaining only essential information, whereas \\textbf{GaussPainter} leverages powerful diffusion priors with mask-guided refinement to restore high-quality renderings from heavily pruned Gaussian scenes. Unlike conventional inpainting, GaussPainter not only fills in missing regions but also enhances visible pixels, yielding substantial improvements in degraded renderings. To ensure practicality, it adopts a lightweight VAE and a one-step diffusion design, enabling real-time restoration. Our framework can even achieve over $100\\times$ compression (reducing a typical 354.77 MB model to about 3.31 MB) while preserving fidelity and significantly improving image quality under challenging conditions.

To support this task, we construct a new multi-modal tracking dataset, coined RGBDT500, which consists of 500 videos with synchronised frames across the three modalities. Each frame provides spatially aligned RGB, depth, and thermal infrared images with precise object bounding box annotations. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal tracker, dubbed RDTTrack.

In specific, RDTTrack fuses thermal infrared and depth modalities under a proposed orthogonal projection constraint, then integrates them with RGB signals as prompts for the pre-trained foundation tracking model, effectively harmonising tri-modal complementary cues. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method, showing significant improvements over existing dual-modal approaches in terms of tracking accuracy and robustness in complex scenarios.",

Despite their success in general domains, applying these models to medical imaging remains challenging due to the limited availability of diverse imaging modalities and multilingual clinical data. Most existing medical VLMs are trained on a subset of imaging modalities and focus primarily on high-resource languages, thus limiting their generalizability and clinical utility. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel Vietnamese-language multimodal medical dataset comprising 1,567,062 paired CT-PET images and corresponding 2,757 full-length clinical reports. This dataset is designed to fill two pressing gaps in medical AI development: (1) the lack of PET/CT imaging data in existing VLMs training corpora, which hinders the development of models capable of handling functional imaging tasks; and (2) the underrepresentation of low-resource languages, particularly the Vietnamese language, in medical vision-language research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first dataset to provide comprehensive PET/CT-report pairs in Vietnamese. We further introduce a training framework to enhance VLMs' learning, including data augmentation and expert-validated test sets. We conduct comprehensive experiments benchmarking state-of-the-art VLMs on downstream tasks, including medical report generation and visual question answering. The experimental results show that incorporating our dataset significantly improves the performance of existing VLMs. We believe this dataset and benchmark will serve as a pivotal step in advancing the development of more robust VLMs for medical imaging, particularly in low-resource languages, and improving their clinical relevance in Vietnamese healthcare.",

Polarimetric imaging offers a single-sensor route to mitigate water-surface glare that disrupts semantic segmentation of floating objects. We benchmark state-of-the-art fusion networks on PoTATO, a public dataset of polarimetric images of plastic bottles in inland waterways, and compare their performance with single-image baselines using traditional models. Our results indicate that polarimetric cues help recover low-contrast objects and suppress reflection-induced false positives, raising mean IoU and lowering contour error relative to RGB inputs. These sharper masks come at a cost: the additional channels enlarge the models increasing the computational load and introducing the risk of new false positives. By providing a reproducible, diagnostic benchmark and publicly available code, we hope to help researchers choose if polarized cameras are suitable for their applications and to accelerate related research.",

        "summary": "The webpage-to-code task requires models to understand visual representations of webpages and generate corresponding code. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on static screenshot-to-code tasks, thereby overlooking the dynamic interactions fundamental to real-world web applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces IWR-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in interactive webpage reconstruction from video. IWR-Bench comprises 113 meticulously curated tasks from 100 real-world websites, with 1,001 actions and featuring diverse interaction complexities (e.g., web games), visual styles, and domains. Aligning with standard web development practices, each task includes not only user interaction videos but also all crawled static assets (e.g., images, videos). This benchmark evaluates models on two fundamental challenges: comprehensive multi-modal reasoning to infer interaction logic from video and assets, and advanced code generation to translate this logic into functional code. An agent-as-a-judge framework with a comprehensive metric system automatically assesses the functional correctness and visual fidelity of generated webpages. Extensive experiments on 28 LVLMs reveal a significant challenge: the best model achieves an overall score of only 36.35%, as functional correctness (24.39% IFS) lags significantly behind visual fidelity (64.25% VFS). These results highlight critical limitations in current models' ability to reason about temporal dynamics and synthesize event-driven logic, establishing IWR-Bench as a challenging frontier for vision-language research. The benchmark and evaluation code will be made publicly available. Code is available at https://github.com/L-O-I/IWR-Bench.",

We introduce a training-free framework that improves physical plausibility at inference time by explicitly reasoning about implausibility and guiding the generation away from it. Specifically, we employ a lightweight physics-aware reasoning pipeline to construct counterfactual prompts that deliberately encode physics-violating behaviors. Then, we propose a novel Synchronized Decoupled Guidance (SDG) strategy, which leverages these prompts through synchronized directional normalization to counteract lagged suppression and trajectory-decoupled denoising to mitigate cumulative trajectory bias, ensuring that implausible content is suppressed immediately and consistently throughout denoising. Experiments across different physical domains show that our approach substantially enhances physical fidelity while maintaining photorealism, despite requiring no additional training. Ablation studies confirm the complementary effectiveness of both the physics-aware reasoning component and SDG. In particular, the aforementioned two designs of SDG are also individually validated to contribute critically to the suppression of implausible content and the overall gains in physical plausibility. This establishes a new and plug-and-play physics-aware paradigm for video generation.",

        "summary": "We introduce SANA-Video, a small diffusion model that can efficiently generate videos up to 720x1280 resolution and minute-length duration. SANA-Video synthesizes high-resolution, high-quality and long videos with strong text-video alignment at a remarkably fast speed, deployable on RTX 5090 GPU. Two core designs ensure our efficient, effective and long video generation: (1) Linear DiT: We leverage linear attention as the core operation, which is more efficient than vanilla attention given the large number of tokens processed in video generation. (2) Constant-Memory KV cache for Block Linear Attention: we design block-wise autoregressive approach for long video generation by employing a constant-memory state, derived from the cumulative properties of linear attention. This KV cache provides the Linear DiT with global context at a fixed memory cost, eliminating the need for a traditional KV cache and enabling efficient, minute-long video generation. In addition, we explore effective data filters and model training strategies, narrowing the training cost to 12 days on 64 H100 GPUs, which is only 1% of the cost of MovieGen. Given its low cost, SANA-Video achieves competitive performance compared to modern state-of-the-art small diffusion models (e.g., Wan 2.1-1.3B and SkyReel-V2-1.3B) while being 16x faster in measured latency. Moreover, SANA-Video can be deployed on RTX 5090 GPUs with NVFP4 precision, accelerating the inference speed of generating a 5-second 720p video from 71s to 29s (2.4x speedup). In summary, SANA-Video enables low-cost, high-quality video generation.",

Thus, developing methods for highly accurate segmentation of TBI lesions is essential for reliable neuroimaging analysis. This study aims to develop an effective automated segmentation pipeline to automatically detect and segment TBI lesions in T1-weighted MRI scans. We evaluate multiple approaches to achieve accurate segmentation of the TBI lesions.

        "summary": "A central goal in AI is to represent scenes as compositions of discrete objects, enabling fine-grained, controllable image and video generation. Yet leading diffusion models treat images holistically and rely on text conditioning, creating a mismatch for object-level editing. This thesis introduces a framework that adapts powerful pretrained diffusion models for object-centric synthesis while retaining their generative capacity. We identify a core challenge: balancing global scene coherence with disentangled object control. Our method integrates lightweight, slot-based conditioning into pretrained models, preserving their visual priors while providing object-specific manipulation. For images, SlotAdapt augments diffusion models with a register token for background/style and slot-conditioned modules for objects, reducing text-conditioning bias and achieving state-of-the-art results in object discovery, segmentation, compositional editing, and controllable image generation. We further extend the framework to video. Using Invariant Slot Attention (ISA) to separate object identity from pose and a Transformer-based temporal aggregator, our approach maintains consistent object representations and dynamics across frames. This yields new benchmarks in unsupervised video object segmentation and reconstruction, and supports advanced editing tasks such as object removal, replacement, and insertion without explicit supervision. Overall, this work establishes a general and scalable approach to object-centric generative modeling for images and videos. By bridging human object-based perception and machine learning, it expands the design space for interactive, structured, and user-driven generative tools in creative, scientific, and practical domains.",

        "summary": "Capturing screens is now routine in our everyday lives. But the photographs of emissive displays are often influenced by the flicker-banding (FB), which is alternating bright%u2013dark stripes that arise from temporal aliasing between a camera's rolling-shutter readout and the display's brightness modulation. Unlike moire degradation, which has been extensively studied, the FB remains underexplored despite its frequent and severe impact on readability and perceived quality. We formulate FB removal as a dedicated restoration task and introduce Removal of Image Flicker-Banding via Latent Diffusion Enhancement, RIFLE, a diffusion-based framework designed to remove FB while preserving fine details. We propose the flicker-banding prior estimator (FPE) that predicts key banding attributes and injects it into the restoration network. Additionally, Masked Loss (ML) is proposed to concentrate supervision on banded regions without sacrificing global fidelity. To overcome data scarcity, we provide a simulation pipeline that synthesizes FB in the luminance domain with stochastic jitter in banding angle, banding spacing, and banding width. Feathered boundaries and sensor noise are also applied for a more realistic simulation. For evaluation, we collect a paired real-world FB dataset with pixel-aligned banding-free references captured via long exposure. Across quantitative metrics and visual comparisons on our real-world dataset, RIFLE consistently outperforms recent image reconstruction baselines from mild to severe flicker-banding. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to research the simulation and removal of FB. Our work establishes a great foundation for subsequent research in both the dataset construction and the removal model design. Our dataset and code will be released soon.",

We evaluate both human participants and state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) on the task of rearranging these clips into coherent event sequences to assess visual reasoning capabilities. Results reveal a significant gap: VLMs struggle to match human performance. While human-annotated textual descriptions improve model accuracy, they do not affect human performance, suggesting that models rely more on language priors than on visual understanding. Even with annotations, VLMs fall short of human-level reasoning, underscoring persistent challenges in visual reasoning. A deeper analysis across sub-categories shows that VLMs perform relatively better on videos where temporal and causal reasoning are dominant, compared to those where contextual and spatial reasoning are dominant.

FreeRet first derives semantically grounded embeddings directly from the model for fast candidate search, and then exploits its reasoning ability for precise reranking. The framework contributes three advances: bypassing lexical alignment layers to obtain semantically faithful embeddings, conditioning representation generation with explicit priors, and mitigating framing effect in reranking via neutral choice framing. On the MMEB and MMEB-V2 benchmarks spanning 46 datasets, FreeRet substantially outperforms models trained on millions of pairs. Beyond benchmarks, FreeRet is model-agnostic and scales seamlessly across MLLM families and sizes, preserves their generative abilities, supports arbitrary modality combinations, and unifies retrieval, reranking, and generation into end-to-end RAG within a single model. Our findings demonstrate that pretrained MLLMs, when carefully harnessed, can serve as strong retrieval engines without training, closing a critical gap in their role as generalists.",

While deep learning offers a promising alternative, a systematic evaluation of state of the art models such as YOLOv11 for fine grained PBS detection is still lacking.

First, we curate a large scale annotated dataset for blood cell detection and classification, comprising 16,891 images across 12 peripheral blood cell (PBC) classes, along with the red blood cell class, all carefully re annotated for object detection tasks. In total, the dataset contains 298,850 annotated cells. Second, we leverage this dataset to conduct a comprehensive evaluation of five YOLOv11 variants (ranging from Nano to XLarge). These models are rigorously benchmarked under two data splitting strategies (70:20:10 and 80:10:10) and systematically assessed using multiple performance criteria, including mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, F1 score, and computational efficiency. Our experiments show that the YOLOv11 Medium variant achieves the best trade off, reaching a mAP@0.5 of 0.934 under the 8:1:1 split. Larger models (Large and XLarge) provide only marginal accuracy gains at substantially higher computational cost. Moreover, the 8:1:1 split consistently outperforms the 7:2:1 split across all models. These findings highlight YOLOv11, particularly the Medium variant, as a highly effective framework for automated, fine grained PBS detection.

        "summary": "Building a joint face-skull morphable model holds great potential for applications such as remote diagnostics, surgical planning, medical education, and physically based facial simulation. However, realizing this vision is constrained by the scarcity of paired face-skull data, insufficient registration accuracy, and limited exploration of reconstruction and clinical applications. Moreover, individuals with craniofacial deformities are often overlooked, resulting in underrepresentation and limited inclusivity. To address these challenges, we first construct a dataset comprising over 200 samples, including both normal cases and rare craniofacial conditions. Each case contains a CT-based skull, a CT-based face, and a high-fidelity textured face scan. Secondly, we propose a novel dense ray matching registration method that ensures topological consistency across face, skull, and their tissue correspondences. Based on this, we introduce the 3D Bidirectional Face-Skull Morphable Model (BFSM), which enables shape inference between the face and skull through a shared coefficient space, while also modeling tissue thickness variation to support one-to-many facial reconstructions from the same skull, reflecting individual changes such as fat over time. Finally, we demonstrate the potential of BFSM in medical applications, including 3D face-skull reconstruction from a single image and surgical planning prediction.

        "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive performance across a wide range of vision-language tasks, while they remain vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Existing backdoor attacks on LVLMs aim to force the victim model to generate a predefined target pattern, which is either inserted into or replaces the original content. We find that these fixed-pattern attacks are relatively easy to detect, because the attacked LVLM tends to memorize such frequent patterns in the training dataset, thereby exhibiting overconfidence on these targets given poisoned inputs. To address these limitations, we introduce TokenSwap, a more evasive and stealthy backdoor attack that focuses on the compositional understanding capabilities of LVLMs. Instead of enforcing a fixed targeted content, TokenSwap subtly disrupts the understanding of object relationships in text. Specifically, it causes the backdoored model to generate outputs that mention the correct objects in the image but misrepresent their relationships (i.e., bags-of-words behavior). During training, TokenSwap injects a visual trigger into selected samples and simultaneously swaps the grammatical roles of key tokens in the corresponding textual answers. However, the poisoned samples exhibit only subtle differences from the original ones, making it challenging for the model to learn the backdoor behavior. To address this, TokenSwap employs an adaptive token-weighted loss that explicitly emphasizes the learning of swapped tokens, such that the visual triggers and bags-of-words behavior are associated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TokenSwap achieves high attack success rates while maintaining superior evasiveness and stealthiness across multiple benchmarks and various LVLM architectures.",

By integrating a multi-layer progressive architecture with adaptive skip connections, it significantly enhances the model's nonlinear representation capability in feature-degraded regions, effectively suppressing feature confusion under fog interference.Finally, we further propose a weather-aware GCN that dynamically constructs spatial adjacency matrices using deep features extracted by MSA-KAN. Experiments on four public datasets demonstrate that our method achieves a 12.2\\%-27.5\\% reduction in MAE metrics compared to mainstream algorithms in dense fog scenarios.",

However, there remains confusion about which approach is generally preferable, and the substantial discrepancies in their modeling assumptions and practical implementations have hindered a unified theoretical account of their relative merits. We have, for the first time, provided a unified theoretical and experimental validation of these two models. We recast their frameworks through the lens of Stochastic Optimal Control and prove that the cost function of the Diffusion Bridge is lower, guiding the system toward more stable and natural trajectories. Simultaneously, from the perspective of Optimal Transport, interpolation coefficients $t$ and $1-t$ of Flow Matching become increasingly ineffective when the training data size is reduced. To corroborate these theoretical claims, we propose a novel, powerful architecture for Diffusion Bridge built on a latent Transformer, and implement a Flow Matching model with the same structure to enable a fair performance comparison in various experiments. Comprehensive experiments are conducted across Image Inpainting, Super-Resolution, Deblurring, Denoising, Translation, and Style Transfer tasks, systematically varying both the distributional discrepancy (different difficulty) and the training data size. Extensive empirical results align perfectly with our theoretical predictions and allow us to delineate the respective advantages and disadvantages of these two models.

Recent approaches achieve zero-shot, open-vocabulary 3D semantic mapping by assigning embedding vectors to 2D class-agnostic masks generated via vision-language models (VLMs) and projecting these into 3D. However, these methods often produce fragmented masks and inaccurate semantic assignments due to the direct use of raw masks, limiting their effectiveness in complex environments. To address this, we leverage SemanticSAM with progressive granularity refinement to generate more accurate and numerous object-level masks, mitigating the over-segmentation commonly observed in mask generation models such as vanilla SAM, and improving downstream 3D semantic segmentation. To further enhance semantic context, we employ a context-aware CLIP encoding strategy that integrates multiple contextual views of each mask using empirically determined weighting, providing much richer visual context. We evaluate our approach on multiple 3D scene understanding tasks, including 3D semantic segmentation and object retrieval from language queries, across several benchmark datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements over existing methods, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.",

        "summary": "Flow map models such as Consistency Models (CM) and Mean Flow (MF) enable few-step generation by learning the long jump of the ODE solution of diffusion models, yet training remains unstable, sensitive to hyperparameters, and costly. Initializing from a pre-trained diffusion model helps, but still requires converting infinitesimal steps into a long-jump map, leaving instability unresolved. We introduce mid-training, the first concept and practical method that inserts a lightweight intermediate stage between the (diffusion) pre-training and the final flow map training (i.e., post-training) for vision generation. Concretely, Consistency Mid-Training (CMT) is a compact and principled stage that trains a model to map points along a solver trajectory from a pre-trained model, starting from a prior sample, directly to the solver-generated clean sample. It yields a trajectory-consistent and stable initialization. This initializer outperforms random and diffusion-based baselines and enables fast, robust convergence without heuristics. Initializing post-training with CMT weights further simplifies flow map learning. Empirically, CMT achieves state of the art two step FIDs: 1.97 on CIFAR-10, 1.32 on ImageNet 64x64, and 1.84 on ImageNet 512x512, while using up to 98% less training data and GPU time, compared to CMs. On ImageNet 256x256, CMT reaches 1-step FID 3.34 while cutting total training time by about 50% compared to MF from scratch (FID 3.43).

To address this issue, we propose EQUISeg, a multimodal segmentation framework that balances modality contributions through equal encoding of modalities.

While Direct Preference Optimization(DPO) is widely used for alignment, its application to MLLMs often fails to capture fine-grained semantic differences and encourages shortcut learning. To address these challenges, we propose Semantic Curriculum Preference Optimization (SCPO), a novel framework for MLLM alignment. SCPO employs a progressive, easy-to-hard curriculum built upon our Semantic Curriculum Preference Pairs dataset, which provides fine-grained semantic contrasts sorted by difficulty. This curriculum is trained with a dynamic reference model and a novel symmetric, bidirectional objective to facilitate simultaneous learning from both textual and visual preferences. To our knowledge, SCPO is the first framework to unify semantics, symmetry, and curriculum for MLLMs alignment, effectively mitigating visual hallucinations. Extensive experiments on LLaVA models across various scales and versions validate that SCPO demonstrates superior performance compared to baseline models on multiple hallucination benchmarks, reducing the hallucination rate by up to 62.9%. Moreover, evaluations on generalized benchmarks show that SCPO improves factuality while preserving general capabilities, with its performance remaining stable across general vision-language benchmarks.",

By introducing a selective representation framework, we can shrink databases to 10% of their original size without sacrificing retrieval accuracy. We first explore clustering and coreset selection methods to identify representative samples that capture the key features of each garment and its internal variability. Then, we introduce an efficient outlier removal method, based on a neighbour-homogeneity consistency score measure, that filters out uncharacteristic samples prior to selection. We evaluate our approach on three public datasets: DeepFashion Attribute, DeepFashion Con2Shop, and DeepFashion2. The results demonstrate a clear performance-efficiency trade-off by strategically pruning and selecting representative vectors of images. The retrieval system maintains near-optimal accuracy, while greatly reducing computational costs by reducing the images added to the vector database. Furthermore, applying our outlier removal method to clustering techniques yields even higher retrieval performance by removing non-discriminative samples before the selection.",

Laban movement analysis has been widely used by dance experts to express the details of motion including motion quality as consistent as possible. Inspired by that, this work aims for interpretable and expressive control of human motion generation by seamlessly integrating the quantification methods of Laban Effort and Shape components into the text-guided motion generation models. Our proposed zero-shot, inference-time optimization method guides the motion generation model to have desired Laban Effort and Shape components without any additional motion data by updating the text embedding of pretrained diffusion models during the sampling step.

Recent advancements in AD, however, are often biased towards industrial inspection, struggle to generalize to broader tasks like semantic anomaly detection and vice versa. Although recent methods have attempted to address general anomaly detection, their performance remains sensitive to dataset-specific settings and single-class tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel dual-model ensemble approach based on knowledge distillation (KD) to bridge this gap. Our framework consists of a teacher and two student models: an Encoder-Decoder model, specialized in detecting patch-level minor defects for industrial AD and an Encoder-Encoder model, optimized for semantic AD. Both models leverage a shared pre-trained encoder (DINOv2) to extract high-quality feature representations. The dual models are jointly learned using the Noisy-OR objective, and the final anomaly score is obtained using the joint probability via local and semantic anomaly scores derived from the respective models. We evaluate our method on eight public benchmarks under both single-class and multi-class settings: MVTec-AD, MVTec-LOCO, VisA and Real-IAD for industrial inspection and CIFAR-10/100, FMNIST and View for semantic anomaly detection. The proposed method achieved state-of-the-art accuracies in both domains, in multi-class as well as single-class settings, demonstrating generalization across multiple domains of anomaly detection. Our model achieved an image-level AUROC of 99.7% on MVTec-AD and 97.8% on CIFAR-10, which is significantly better than the prior general AD models in multi-class settings and even higher than the best specialist models on individual benchmarks.",

To address this gap, we propose UI2V-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating I2V models with a focus on semantic understanding and reasoning. It introduces four primary evaluation dimensions: spatial understanding, attribute binding, category understanding, and reasoning. To assess these dimensions, we design two evaluation methods based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): an instance-level pipeline for fine-grained semantic understanding, and a feedback-based reasoning pipeline that enables step-by-step causal assessment for more accurate evaluation. UI2V-Bench includes approximately 500 carefully constructed text-image pairs and evaluates a range of both open source and closed-source I2V models across all defined dimensions. We further incorporate human evaluations, which show strong alignment with the proposed MLLM-based metrics. Overall, UI2V-Bench fills a critical gap in I2V evaluation by emphasizing semantic comprehension and reasoning ability, offering a robust framework and dataset to support future research and model development in the field.",

        "summary": "3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as an efficient approach for achieving photorealistic rendering. Recent MLP-based variants further improve visual fidelity but introduce substantial decoding overhead during rendering. To alleviate computation cost, several pruning strategies and level-of-detail (LOD) techniques have been introduced, aiming to effectively reduce the number of Gaussian primitives in large-scale scenes. However, our analysis reveals that significant redundancy still remains due to the lack of occlusion awareness. In this work, we propose Proxy-GS, a novel pipeline that exploits a proxy to introduce Gaussian occlusion awareness from any view. At the core of our approach is a fast proxy system capable of producing precise occlusion depth maps at a resolution of 1000x1000 under 1ms. This proxy serves two roles: first, it guides the culling of anchors and Gaussians to accelerate rendering speed. Second, it guides the densification towards surfaces during training, avoiding inconsistencies in occluded regions, and improving the rendering quality. In heavily occluded scenarios, such as the MatrixCity Streets dataset, Proxy-GS not only equips MLP-based Gaussian splatting with stronger rendering capability but also achieves faster rendering speed. Specifically, it achieves more than 2.5x speedup over Octree-GS, and consistently delivers substantially higher rendering quality. Code will be public upon acceptance.",

Using the publicly available and relatively clean CIFAKE dataset, we identify common quality issues and quantify their impact on training. Building on these findings, we develop a pipeline that integrates two community-developed tools, CleanVision and Fastdup. We analyze their underlying mechanisms and introduce several enhancements, including automatic threshold selection to detect problematic images without manual tuning. Experimental results demonstrate that not all quality issues exert the same level of impact. While convolutional neural networks show resilience to certain distortions, they are particularly vulnerable to degradations that obscure critical visual features, such as blurring and severe downscaling. To assess the performance of existing tools and the effectiveness of our proposed enhancements, we formulate the detection of low-quality images as a binary classification task and use the F1 score as the evaluation metric. Our automatic thresholding method improves the F1 score from 0.6794 to 0.9468 under single perturbations and from 0.7447 to 0.8557 under dual perturbations. For near-duplicate detection, our deduplication strategy increases the F1 score from 0.4576 to 0.7928. These results underscore the effectiveness of our workflow and provide a foundation for advancing data quality assessment in image-based machine learning.",

        "summary": "Visual generation quality has been greatly promoted with the rapid advances in diffusion transformers (DiTs), which is attributed to the scaling of model size and complexity. However, these attributions also hinder the practical deployment of DiTs on edge devices, limiting their development and application. Serve as an efficient model compression technique, model post-training quantization (PTQ) can reduce the memory consumption and speed up the inference, with inevitable performance degradation. To alleviate the degradation, we propose CLQ, a cross-layer guided orthogonal-based quantization method for DiTs. To be specific, CLQ consists of three key designs. First, we observe that the calibration data used by most of the PTQ methods can not honestly represent the distribution of the activations. Therefore, we propose cross-block calibration (CBC) to obtain accurate calibration data, with which the quantization can be better guided. Second, we propose orthogonal-based smoothing (OBS), which quantifies the outlier score of each channel and leverages block Hadamard matrix to smooth the outliers with negligible overhead. Third, we propose cross-layer parameter searching (CLPS) to search. We evaluate CLQ with both image generation and video generation models and successfully compress the model into W4A4 with negligible degradation in visual quality and metrics. CLQ achieves 3.98x memory saving and 3.95x speedup. Our code is available at \\hyperlink{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}{https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/CLQ}.",

        "summary": "We have recently observed the commercial roll-out of robotaxis in various countries. They are deployed within an operational design domain (ODD) on specific routes and environmental conditions, and are subject to continuous monitoring to regain control in safety-critical situations. Since ODDs typically cover urban areas, robotaxis must reliably detect vulnerable road users (VRUs) such as pedestrians, bicyclists, or e-scooter riders. To better handle such varied traffic situations, end-to-end AI, which directly compute vehicle control actions from multi-modal sensor data instead of only for perception, is on the rise. High quality data is needed for systematically training and evaluating such systems within their OOD. In this work, we propose PCICF, a framework to systematically identify and classify VRU situations to support ODD's incident analysis. We base our work on the existing synthetic dataset SMIRK, and enhance it by extending its single-pedestrian-only design into the MoreSMIRK dataset, a structured dictionary of multi-pedestrian crossing situations constructed systematically. We then use space-filling curves (SFCs) to transform multi-dimensional features of scenarios into characteristic patterns, which we match with corresponding entries in MoreSMIRK. We evaluate PCICF with the large real-world dataset PIE, which contains more than 150 manually annotated pedestrian crossing videos. We show that PCICF can successfully identify and classify complex pedestrian crossings, even when groups of pedestrians merge or split. By leveraging computationally efficient components like SFCs, PCICF has even potential to be used onboard of robotaxis for OOD detection for example. We share an open-source replication package for PCICF containing its algorithms, the complete MoreSMIRK dataset and dictionary, as well as our experiment results presented in: https://github.com/Claud1234/PCICF",

To address this limitation, we propose Vid-LLM, a video-based 3D-MLLM that directly processes video inputs without requiring external 3D data, making it practical for real-world deployment. In our method, the geometric prior are directly used to improve the performance of the sceen perception. To integrate the geometric cues into the MLLM compactly, we design a Cross-Task Adapter (CTA) module to align the 3D geometric priors with the vision-language representations. To ensure geometric consistency and integrity, we introduce a Metric Depth Model that recovers real-scale geometry from the reconstruction outputs. Finally, the model is fine-tuned with a two-stage distillation optimization strategy, realizing fast convergence and stabilizes training. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verified the effectiveness of our method on 3D Question Answering, 3D Dense Captioning and 3D Visual Grounding tasks, demonstrating the superior multi-task capabilities.",

        "summary": "Learning from procedural videos remains a core challenge in self-supervised representation learning, as real-world instructional data often contains background segments, repeated actions, and steps presented out of order. Such variability violates the strong monotonicity assumptions underlying many alignment methods. Prior state-of-the-art approaches, such as OPEL, leverage Kantorovich Optimal Transport (KOT) to build frame-to-frame correspondences, but rely solely on feature similarity and fail to capture the higher-order temporal structure of a task. In this paper, we introduce REALIGN, a self-supervised framework for procedure learning based on Regularized Fused Partial Gromov-Wasserstein Optimal Transport (R-FPGWOT). In contrast to KOT, our formulation jointly models visual correspondences and temporal relations under a partial alignment scheme, enabling robust handling of irrelevant frames, repeated actions, and non-monotonic step orders common in instructional videos. To stabilize training, we integrate FPGWOT distances with inter-sequence contrastive learning, avoiding the need for multiple regularizers and preventing collapse to degenerate solutions. Across egocentric (EgoProceL) and third-person (ProceL, CrossTask) benchmarks, REALIGN achieves up to 18.9% average F1-score improvements and over 30% temporal IoU gains, while producing more interpretable transport maps that preserve key-step orderings and filter out noise.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in remote sensing technology have made submeter resolution imagery increasingly accessible, offering remarkable detail for fine-grained land cover analysis. However, its full potential remains underutilized - particularly for large-scale land cover mapping - due to the lack of sufficient, high-quality annotated datasets. Existing labels are typically derived from pre-existing products or manual annotation, which are often unreliable or prohibitively expensive, particularly given the rich visual detail and massive data volumes of submeter imagery. Inspired by the spatial autocorrelation principle, which suggests that objects of the same class tend to co-occur with similar visual features in local neighborhoods, we propose the Mask Clustering-based Annotation Engine (MCAE), which treats semantically consistent mask groups as the minimal annotating units to enable efficient, simultaneous annotation of multiple instances. It significantly improves annotation efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude, while preserving label quality, semantic diversity, and spatial representativeness. With MCAE, we build a high-quality annotated dataset of about 14 billion labeled pixels, referred to as HiCity-LC, which supports the generation of city-scale land cover maps across five major Chinese cities with classification accuracies above 85%. It is the first publicly available submeter resolution city-level land cover benchmark, highlighting the scalability and practical utility of MCAE for large-scale, submeter resolution mapping.

        "summary": "Point cloud registration is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Most existing methods rely solely on geometric information for feature extraction and matching. Recently, several studies have incorporated color information from RGB-D data into feature extraction. Although these methods achieve remarkable improvements, they have not fully exploited the abundant texture and semantic information in images, and the feature fusion is performed in an image-lossy manner, which limit their performance. In this paper, we propose DINOReg, a registration network that sufficiently utilizes both visual and geometric information to solve the point cloud registration problem. Inspired by advances in vision foundation models, we employ DINOv2 to extract informative visual features from images, and fuse visual and geometric features at the patch level. This design effectively combines the rich texture and global semantic information extracted by DINOv2 with the detailed geometric structure information captured by the geometric backbone. Additionally, a mixed positional embedding is proposed to encode positional information from both image space and point cloud space, which enhances the model's ability to perceive spatial relationships between patches. Extensive experiments on the RGBD-3DMatch and RGBD-3DLoMatch datasets demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art geometry-only and multi-modal registration methods, with a 14.2% increase in patch inlier ratio and a 15.7% increase in registration recall.

However, synthesizing street-view images from corresponding satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to substantial differences in appearance and viewing perspective between these two domains. This paper presents a hybrid framework that integrates diffusion-based models and conditional generative adversarial networks to generate geographically consistent street-view images from satellite imagery. Our approach uses a multi-stage training strategy that incorporates Stable Diffusion as the core component within a dual-branch architecture. To enhance the framework's capabilities, we integrate a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that enables the generation of geographically consistent panoramic street views. Furthermore, we implement a fusion strategy that leverages the strengths of both models to create robust representations, thereby improving the geometric consistency and visual quality of the generated street-view images. The proposed framework is evaluated on the challenging Cross-View USA (CVUSA) dataset, a standard benchmark for cross-view image synthesis. Experimental results demonstrate that our hybrid approach outperforms diffusion-only methods across multiple evaluation metrics and achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. The framework successfully generates realistic and geometrically consistent street-view images while preserving fine-grained local details, including street markings, secondary roads, and atmospheric elements such as clouds.",

We argue that model merging is a natural fit for deepfake detection: unlike generic multi-task settings with disjoint labels, deepfake specialists share the same binary decision and differ in generator-specific artifacts. Empirically, we show that simple weight averaging preserves Real representations while attenuating Fake-specific cues. Building upon these findings, we propose Real-aware Residual Model Merging (R$^2$M), a training-free parameter-space merging framework. R$^2$M estimates a shared Real component via a low-rank factorization of task vectors, decomposes each specialist into a Real-aligned part and a Fake residual, denoises residuals with layerwise rank truncation, and aggregates them with per-task norm matching to prevent any single generator from dominating. A concise rationale explains why a simple head suffices: the Real component induces a common separation direction in feature space, while truncated residuals contribute only minor off-axis variations. Across in-distribution, cross-dataset, and unseen-dataset, R$^2$M outperforms joint training and other merging baselines. Importantly, R$^2$M is also composable: when a new forgery family appears, we fine-tune one specialist and re-merge, eliminating the need for retraining.",

        "summary": "Unified Multimodal Models (UMMs) built on shared autoregressive (AR) transformers are attractive for their architectural simplicity. However, we identify a critical limitation: when trained on multimodal inputs, modality-shared transformers suffer from severe gradient conflicts between vision and text, particularly in shallow and deep layers. We trace this issue to the fundamentally different low-level statistical properties of images and text, while noting that conflicts diminish in middle layers where representations become more abstract and semantically aligned. To overcome this challenge, we propose Uni-X, a two-end-separated, middle-shared architecture. Uni-X dedicates its initial and final layers to modality-specific processing, while maintaining shared parameters in the middle layers for high-level semantic fusion. This X-shaped design not only eliminates gradient conflicts at both ends but also further alleviates residual conflicts in the shared layers. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of Uni-X. Under identical training conditions, Uni-X achieves superior training efficiency compared to strong baselines. When scaled to 3B parameters with larger training data, Uni-X matches or surpasses 7B AR-based UMMs, achieving a GenEval score of 82 for image generation alongside strong performance in text and vision understanding tasks. These results establish Uni-X as a parameter-efficient and scalable foundation for future unified multimodal modeling. Our code is available at https://github.com/CURRENTF/Uni-X",

We introduce \\textbf{DRIFT} (Divergent Response in Filtered Transformations), a stochastic ensemble of lightweight, learnable filters trained to actively disrupt gradient consensus. Unlike prior randomized defenses that rely on gradient masking, DRIFT enforces \\emph{gradient dissonance} by maximizing divergence in Jacobian- and logit-space responses while preserving natural predictions. Our contributions are threefold: (i) we formalize gradient consensus and provide a theoretical analysis linking consensus to transferability; (ii) we propose a consensus-divergence training strategy combining prediction consistency, Jacobian separation, logit-space separation, and adversarial robustness; and (iii) we show that DRIFT achieves substantial robustness gains on ImageNet across CNNs and Vision Transformers, outperforming state-of-the-art preprocessing, adversarial training, and diffusion-based defenses under adaptive white-box, transfer-based, and gradient-free attacks.

LamFormer is a novel U-shaped network that employs Linear Attention Mamba (LAM) in an enhanced pyramid encoder to capture multi-scale long-range dependencies. We construct the Parallel Hierarchical Feature Aggregation (PHFA) module to aggregate features from different layers of the encoder, narrowing the semantic gap among features while filtering information.

The generated weights can be rearranged as the parameters of a convolutional neural network, which forms an implicit neural representation (INR), and decodes into videos with frame indices as the input. Our framework consists of two stages: 1) A hypernetworkbased tokenizer that encodes raw videos from pixel space to neural parameter space, where the bottleneck latent serves as INR weights to decode. 2) An implicit diffusion transformer that denoises on the latent INR weights. In contrast to traditional video tokenizers that encode videos into frame-wise feature maps, NeRV-Diffusion compresses and generates a video holistically as a unified neural network. This enables efficient and high-quality video synthesis via obviating temporal cross-frame attentions in the denoiser and decoding video latent with dedicated decoders. To achieve Gaussian-distributed INR weights with high expressiveness, we reuse the bottleneck latent across all NeRV layers, as well as reform its weight assignment, upsampling connection and input coordinates. We also introduce SNR-adaptive loss weighting and scheduled sampling for effective training of the implicit diffusion model. NeRV-Diffusion reaches superior video generation quality over previous INR-based models and comparable performance to most recent state-of-the-art non-implicit models on real-world video benchmarks including UCF-101 and Kinetics-600.

        "summary": "Agricultural visual question answering is essential for providing farmers and researchers with accurate and timely knowledge. However, many existing approaches are predominantly developed for evidence-constrained settings such as text-only queries or single-image cases. This design prevents them from coping with real-world agricultural scenarios that often require multi-image inputs with complementary views across spatial scales, and growth stages. Moreover, limited access to up-to-date external agricultural context makes these systems struggle to adapt when evidence is incomplete. In addition, rigid pipelines often lack systematic quality control. To address this gap, we propose a self-reflective and self-improving multi-agent framework that integrates four roles, the Retriever, the Reflector, the Answerer, and the Improver. They collaborate to enable context enrichment, reflective reasoning, answer drafting, and iterative improvement. A Retriever formulates queries and gathers external information, while a Reflector assesses adequacy and triggers sequential reformulation and renewed retrieval. Two Answerers draft candidate responses in parallel to reduce bias. The Improver refines them through iterative checks while ensuring that information from multiple images is effectively aligned and utilized. Experiments on the AgMMU benchmark show that our framework achieves competitive performance on multi-image agricultural QA.",

The core issue is heterogeneous variance in VAE latents, which is amplified during AR decoding, especially under classifier-free guidance (CFG), and can cause variance collapse. We propose SphereAR to address this issue. Its core design is to constrain all AR inputs and outputs -- including after CFG -- to lie on a fixed-radius hypersphere (constant $\\ell_2$ norm), leveraging hyperspherical VAEs. Our theoretical analysis shows that hyperspherical constraint removes the scale component (the primary cause of variance collapse), thereby stabilizing AR decoding. Empirically, on ImageNet generation, SphereAR-H (943M) sets a new state of the art for AR models, achieving FID 1.34. Even at smaller scales, SphereAR-L (479M) reaches FID 1.54 and SphereAR-B (208M) reaches 1.92, matching or surpassing much larger baselines such as MAR-H (943M, 1.55) and VAR-d30 (2B, 1.92).

In this paper, we present OMeGa, an end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes an explicit triangle mesh and 2D Gaussian splats via a flexible binding strategy, where spatial attributes of Gaussian Splats are expressed in the mesh frame and texture attributes are retained on splats. To further improve reconstruction accuracy, we integrate mesh constraints and monocular normal supervision into the optimization, thereby regularizing geometry learning. In addition, we propose a heuristic, iterative mesh-refinement strategy that splits high-error faces and prunes unreliable ones to further improve the detail and accuracy of the reconstructed mesh. OMeGa achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging indoor reconstruction benchmarks, reducing Chamfer-$L_1$ by 47.3\\% over the 2DGS baseline while maintaining competitive novel-view rendering quality.

        "summary": "While Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved substantial progress in video understanding, their application to long video reasoning is hindered by uniform frame sampling and static textual reasoning, which are inefficient and struggle to handle visually intensive video tasks. To overcome these challenges, in this paper, we introduce the concept of thinking with long videos and propose a novel framework FrameThinker. Within this framework, LVLMs are able to iteratively interrogate video content. Developing such video reasoning capabilities in LVLMs presents notable challenges, particularly in adapting the model to new video actions (e.g. select frame), and designing reward functions to guide LVLMs to adopt the newly introduced action. To solve these challenges, we propose a two-phase training strategy, first employing Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) to instill fundamental action capabilities, followed by Reinforcement Learning (RL) to optimize a strategic decision-making policy.Notably, in this RL phase, we conduct an in-depth and comprehensive exploration of the reward design for each action and format reward. Extensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks like Video-Holmes, LongVideo-Reason, and long-video understanding benchmarks such as LongVideoBench, MLVU, VideoMME, and LVBench, demonstrate that FrameThinker achieves a significant average improvement of +10.4% over baselines while drastically reducing the number of processed frames. Most notably, our 7B model, FrameThinker establishes a new state-of-the-art on LongVideo-Reason, achieving 76.1% accuracy using an average of only 20.6 frames.

Our pipeline first renders each primitive in sequence and uses a multimodal model to annotate the image and code; we then build stepwise updates that mirror the incremental addition of primitives.

Our method leverages the rich priors of text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), to transfer segmentations from image space to 3D, even when the annotated and target objects differ significantly in geometry or structure. During training, we optimize a text token for each segment and fine-tune our model with a novel cross-view part correspondence loss. At inference, we segment multi-view renderings of the 3D mesh, fuse the labels in UV-space via voting, refine them with our novel Noise Optimization technique, and finally map the UV-labels back onto the mesh.

We address these issues by proposing Confidence Estimation under Global Context (CEGC), a unified, confidence-driven framework for robust partial 3D registration. CEGC enables accurate alignment in complex scenes by jointly modeling overlap confidence and correspondence reliability within a shared global context. Specifically, the hybrid overlap confidence estimation module integrates semantic descriptors and geometric similarity to detect overlapping regions and suppress outliers early. The context-aware matching strategy smitigates ambiguity by employing global attention to assign soft confidence scores to correspondences, improving robustness. These scores guide a differentiable weighted singular value decomposition solver to compute precise transformations. This tightly coupled pipeline adaptively down-weights uncertain regions and emphasizes contextually reliable matches. Experiments on ModelNet40, ScanObjectNN, and 7Scenes 3D vision datasets demonstrate that CEGC outperforms state-of-the-art methods in accuracy, robustness, and generalization. Overall, CEGC offers an interpretable and scalable solution to partial point cloud registration under challenging conditions.",

        "summary": "Point cloud registration is fundamental in 3D vision applications, including autonomous driving, robotics, and medical imaging, where precise alignment of multiple point clouds is essential for accurate environment reconstruction. However, real-world point clouds are often affected by sensor limitations, environmental noise, and preprocessing errors, making registration challenging due to density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. Existing registration methods rely on direct point matching or surface feature extraction, which are highly susceptible to these corruptions and lead to reduced alignment accuracy. To address these challenges, a skeleton-based robust registration framework is presented, which introduces a corruption-resilient skeletal representation to improve registration robustness and accuracy. The framework integrates skeletal structures into the registration process and combines the transformations obtained from both the corrupted point cloud alignment and its skeleton alignment to achieve optimal registration. In addition, a distribution distance loss function is designed to enforce the consistency between the source and target skeletons, which significantly improves the registration performance. This framework ensures that the alignment considers both the original local geometric features and the global stability of the skeleton structure, resulting in robust and accurate registration results. Experimental evaluations on diverse corrupted datasets demonstrate that SRRF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art registration methods across various corruption scenarios, including density distortions, noise contamination, and geometric deformations. The results confirm the robustness of SRRF in handling corrupted point clouds, making it a potential approach for 3D perception tasks in real-world scenarios.",

In this paper, we first systematically analyze the impact of compression artifacts on several mainstream MLLMs. We find that: Compression distortion unevenly impacts different-level image features, leading to varying effects on MLLMs' downstream tasks depending on their feature-level reliance. Motivated by this discovery, we propose an image Codec TAilored to MLLMs (CoTAM) designed to adaptively protect multi-level features and suit different demands of downstream tasks. The encoder leverages CLIP's shallow-layer attention to generate an importance map for bit allocation, preserving critical semantic regions. Concurrently, the decoder integrates a lightweight adapter with a multi-level loss function to ensure the faithful reconstruction both of low-level details and high-level semantic context for robust synthesis of cross-level features.

The development and testing of EVLF-FM encompassed over 1.3 million total samples from 23 global datasets across eleven imaging modalities related to six clinical specialties: dermatology, hepatology, ophthalmology, pathology, pulmonology, and radiology. External validation employed 8,884 independent test samples from 10 additional datasets across five imaging modalities. Technically, EVLF-FM is developed to assist with multiple disease diagnosis and visual question answering with pixel-level visual grounding and reasoning capabilities. In internal validation for disease diagnostics, EVLF-FM achieved the highest average accuracy (0.858) and F1-score (0.797), outperforming leading generalist and specialist models. In medical visual grounding, EVLF-FM also achieved stellar performance across nine modalities with average mIOU of 0.743 and Acc@0.5 of 0.837. External validations further confirmed strong zero-shot and few-shot performance, with competitive F1-scores despite a smaller model size. Through a hybrid training strategy combining supervised and visual reinforcement fine-tuning, EVLF-FM not only achieves state-of-the-art accuracy but also exhibits step-by-step reasoning, aligning outputs with visual evidence. EVLF-FM is an early multi-disease VLM model with explainability and reasoning capabilities that could advance adoption of and trust in foundation models for real-world clinical deployment.",

        "summary": "Affective video facial analysis (AVFA) has emerged as a key research field for building emotion-aware intelligent systems, yet this field continues to suffer from limited data availability. In recent years, the self-supervised learning (SSL) technique of Masked Autoencoders (MAE) has gained momentum, with growing adaptations in its audio-visual contexts. While scaling has proven essential for breakthroughs in general multi-modal learning domains, its specific impact on AVFA remains largely unexplored. Another core challenge in this field is capturing both intra- and inter-modal correlations through scalable audio-visual representations. To tackle these issues, we propose AVF-MAE++, a family of audio-visual MAE models designed to efficiently investigate the scaling properties in AVFA while enhancing cross-modal correlation modeling. Our framework introduces a novel dual masking strategy across audio and visual modalities and strengthens modality encoders with a more holistic design to better support scalable pre-training. Additionally, we present the Iterative Audio-Visual Correlation Learning Module, which improves correlation learning within the SSL paradigm, bridging the limitations of previous methods. To support smooth adaptation and reduce overfitting risks, we further introduce a progressive semantic injection strategy, organizing the model training into three structured stages. Extensive experiments conducted on 17 datasets, covering three major AVFA tasks, demonstrate that AVF-MAE++ achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. Comprehensive ablation studies further highlight the importance of each proposed component and provide deeper insights into the design choices driving these improvements. Our code and models have been publicly released at Github.",

        "summary": "Instant reconstruction of dynamic 3D humans from uncalibrated sparse-view videos is critical for numerous downstream applications. Existing methods, however, are either limited by the slow reconstruction speeds or incapable of generating novel-time representations. To address these challenges, we propose Forge4D, a feed-forward 4D human reconstruction and interpolation model that efficiently reconstructs temporally aligned representations from uncalibrated sparse-view videos, enabling both novel view and novel time synthesis. Our model simplifies the 4D reconstruction and interpolation problem as a joint task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction and dense motion prediction. For the task of streaming 3D Gaussian reconstruction, we first reconstruct static 3D Gaussians from uncalibrated sparse-view images and then introduce learnable state tokens to enforce temporal consistency in a memory-friendly manner by interactively updating shared information across different timestamps. For novel time synthesis, we design a novel motion prediction module to predict dense motions for each 3D Gaussian between two adjacent frames, coupled with an occlusion-aware Gaussian fusion process to interpolate 3D Gaussians at arbitrary timestamps. To overcome the lack of the ground truth for dense motion supervision, we formulate dense motion prediction as a dense point matching task and introduce a self-supervised retargeting loss to optimize this module. An additional occlusion-aware optical flow loss is introduced to ensure motion consistency with plausible human movement, providing stronger regularization. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our model on both in-domain and out-of-domain datasets. Project page and code at: https://zhenliuzju.github.io/huyingdong/Forge4D.",

To address these issues, we propose BALR-SAM, a boundary-aware low-rank adaptation framework that enhances SAM for medical imaging. It combines three tailored components: (1) a Complementary Detail Enhancement Network (CDEN) using depthwise separable convolutions and multi-scale fusion to capture boundary-sensitive features essential for accurate segmentation; (2) low-rank adapters integrated into SAM's Vision Transformer blocks to optimize feature representation and attention for medical contexts, while simultaneously significantly reducing the parameter space; and (3) a low-rank tensor attention mechanism in the mask decoder, cutting memory usage by 75% and boosting inference speed. Experiments on standard medical segmentation datasets show that BALR-SAM, without requiring prompts, outperforms several state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, including fully fine-tuned MedSAM, while updating just 1.8% (11.7M) of its parameters.",

        "summary": "Objective: Gadolinium-based contrast agents (GBCAs) are commonly employed with T1w MRI to enhance lesion visualization but are restricted in patients at risk of nephrogenic systemic fibrosis and variations in GBCA administration can introduce imaging inconsistencies. This study develops an efficient 3D deep-learning framework to generate T1-contrast enhanced images (T1C) from pre-contrast multiparametric MRI. Approach: We propose the 3D latent rectified flow (T1C-RFlow) model for generating high-quality T1C images. First, T1w and T2-FLAIR images are input into a pretrained autoencoder to acquire an efficient latent space representation. A rectified flow diffusion model is then trained in this latent space representation. The T1C-RFlow model was trained on a curated dataset comprised of the BraTS 2024 glioma (GLI; 1480 patients), meningioma (MEN; 1141 patients), and metastases (MET; 1475 patients) datasets. Selected patients were split into train (N=2860), validation (N=612), and test (N=614) sets. Results: Both qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the T1C-RFlow model outperforms benchmark 3D models (pix2pix, DDPM, Diffusion Transformers (DiT-3D)) trained in the same latent space. T1C-RFlow achieved the following metrics - GLI: NMSE 0.044 +/- 0.047, SSIM 0.935 +/- 0.025; MEN: NMSE 0.046 +/- 0.029, SSIM 0.937 +/- 0.021; MET: NMSE 0.098 +/- 0.088, SSIM 0.905 +/- 0.082. T1C-RFlow had the best tumor reconstruction performance and significantly faster denoising times (6.9 s/volume, 200 steps) than conventional DDPM models in both latent space (37.7s, 1000 steps) and patch-based in image space (4.3 hr/volume). Significance: Our proposed method generates synthetic T1C images that closely resemble ground truth T1C in much less time than previous diffusion models. Further development may permit a practical method for contrast-agent-free MRI for brain tumors.",

        "summary": "While vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal perception (e.g., open-vocabulary object detection) with simple language queries, state-of-the-art VLMs still show limited ability to perceive complex queries involving descriptive attributes and relational clauses. Our in-depth analysis shows that these limitations mainly stem from text encoders in VLMs. Such text encoders behave like bags-of-words and fail to separate target objects from their descriptive attributes and relations in complex queries, resulting in frequent false positives. To address this, we propose restructuring linguistic representations according to the hierarchical relations within sentences for language-based object detection. A key insight is the necessity of disentangling textual tokens into core components-objects, attributes, and relations (\"talk in pieces\")-and subsequently aggregating them into hierarchically structured sentence-level representations (\"see in whole\"). Building on this principle, we introduce the TaSe framework with three main contributions: (1) a hierarchical synthetic captioning dataset spanning three tiers from category names to descriptive sentences; (2) Talk in Pieces, the three-component disentanglement module guided by a novel disentanglement loss function, transforms text embeddings into subspace compositions; and (3) See in Whole, which learns to aggregate disentangled components into hierarchically structured embeddings with the guide of proposed hierarchical objectives. The proposed TaSe framework strengthens the inductive bias of hierarchical linguistic structures, resulting in fine-grained multimodal representations for language-based object detection. Experimental results under the OmniLabel benchmark show a 24% performance improvement, demonstrating the importance of linguistic compositionality.",

Existing generative models, developed to address this issue, often face limitations in output diversity and thus cannot accurately represent 3D medical images. We propose a tumor-generation model that utilizes radiomics features as generative conditions. Radiomics features are high-dimensional handcrafted semantic features that are biologically well-grounded and thus are good candidates for conditioning. Our model employs a GAN-based model to generate tumor masks and a diffusion-based approach to generate tumor texture conditioned on radiomics features. Our method allows the user to generate tumor images according to user-specified radiomics features such as size, shape, and texture at an arbitrary location. This enables the physicians to easily visualize tumor images to better understand tumors according to changing radiomics features. Our approach allows for the removal, manipulation, and repositioning of tumors, generating various tumor types in different scenarios. The model has been tested on tumors in four different organs (kidney, lung, breast, and brain) across CT and MRI. The synthesized images are shown to effectively aid in training for downstream tasks and their authenticity was also evaluated through expert evaluations. Our method has potential usage in treatment planning with diverse synthesized tumors.",

DECERN introduces a multifaceted informativeness measure that combines discrepancy-confusion uncertainty and calibration diversity. The discrepancy-confusion uncertainty quantifies the category directionality and structural stability of fine-grained unlabeled data during local feature fusion. Subsequently, uncertainty-weighted clustering is performed to diversify the uncertainty samples. Then we calibrate the diversity to maximize the global diversity of the selected sample while maintaining its local representativeness.

While previous research has made significant progress in developing radiation-free methods for coronal plane assessment, reliable and accurate evaluation of sagittal alignment without ionizing radiation remains largely underexplored. To address this gap, we propose LatXGen, a novel generative framework that synthesizes realistic lateral spinal radiographs from posterior Red-Green-Blue and Depth (RGBD) images of unclothed backs. This enables accurate, radiation-free estimation of sagittal spinal alignment. LatXGen tackles two core challenges: (1) inferring sagittal spinal morphology changes from a lateral perspective based on posteroanterior surface geometry, and (2) performing cross-modality translation from RGBD input to the radiographic domain. The framework adopts a dual-stage architecture that progressively estimates lateral spinal structure and synthesizes corresponding radiographs. To enhance anatomical consistency, we introduce an attention-based Fast Fourier Convolution (FFC) module for integrating anatomical features from RGBD images and 3D landmarks, and a Spatial Deformation Network (SDN) to model morphological variations in the lateral view. Additionally, we construct the first large-scale paired dataset for this task, comprising 3,264 RGBD and lateral radiograph pairs. Experimental results demonstrate that LatXGen produces anatomically accurate radiographs and outperforms existing GAN-based methods in both visual fidelity and quantitative metrics.

In this paper, we propose FastVSR, which achieves substantial reductions in computational cost by implementing a high compression VAE (spatial compression ratio of 16, denoted as f16). We design the structure of the f16 VAE and introduce a stable training framework. We employ pixel shuffle and channel replication to achieve additional upsampling. Furthermore, we propose a lower-bound-guided training strategy, which introduces a simpler training objective as a lower bound for the VAE's performance. It makes the training process more stable and easier to converge.

        "summary": "Retinal disease diagnosis is critical in preventing vision loss and reducing socioeconomic burdens. Globally, over 2.2 billion people are affected by some form of vision impairment, resulting in annual productivity losses estimated at $411 billion. Traditional manual grading of retinal fundus images by ophthalmologists is time-consuming and subjective. In contrast, deep learning has revolutionized medical diagnostics by automating retinal image analysis and achieving expert-level performance. In this study, we present EYE-DEX, an automated framework for classifying 10 retinal conditions using the large-scale Retinal Disease Dataset comprising 21,577 eye fundus images. We benchmark three pre-trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models--VGG16, VGG19, and ResNet50--with our finetuned VGG16 achieving a state-of-the-art global benchmark test accuracy of 92.36%. To enhance transparency and explainability, we integrate the Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) technique to generate visual explanations highlighting disease-specific regions, thereby fostering clinician trust and reliability in AI-assisted diagnostics.",

In this work, we propose SVAC, a unified model that improves RVOS by scaling up input frames and segmentation tokens to enhance video-language interaction and segmentation precision. To address the resulting computational challenges, SVAC incorporates the Anchor-Based Spatio-Temporal Compression (ASTC) module to compress visual tokens while preserving essential spatio-temporal structure. Moreover, the Clip-Specific Allocation (CSA) strategy is introduced to better handle dynamic object behaviors across video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that SVAC achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple RVOS benchmarks with competitive efficiency.

We question that unlike word as token is universally agreed in language if frame is a appropriate prediction unit? To address this, we present VideoAR, a unified framework that supports a spectrum of prediction units including full frames, key-detail frames, multiscale refinements, and spatiotemporal cubes. Among these designs, we find model video generation using \\textit{spatiotemporal} cubes as prediction units, which allows autoregressive models to operate across both spatial and temporal dimensions simultaneously. This approach eliminates the assumption that frames are the natural atomic units for video autoregression. We evaluate VideoAR across diverse prediction strategies, finding that cube-based prediction consistently delivers superior quality, speed, and temporal coherence. By removing the frame-by-frame constraint, our video generator surpasses state-of-the-art baselines on VBench while achieving faster inference and enabling seamless scaling to minute-long sequences.

Recent work has demonstrated that adding simple visual structures, such as partitions and annotations, improves accuracy, yet the internal mechanisms underlying these gains remain unclear. We investigate this phenomenon and propose the concept of Grounding IDs, latent identifiers induced by external cues that bind objects to their designated partitions across modalities. Through representation analysis, we find that these identifiers emerge as robust within-partition alignment in embedding space and reduce the modality gap between image and text. Causal interventions further confirm that these identifiers mediate binding between objects and symbolic cues. We show that Grounding IDs strengthen attention between related components, which in turn improves cross-modal grounding and reduces hallucinations. Taken together, our results identify Grounding IDs as a key symbolic mechanism explaining how external cues enhance multimodal binding, offering both interpretability and practical improvements in robustness.",

In this paper, we investigate how data influences the pruning of pre-trained vision models. Surprisingly, pruning on one task retains the model's zero-shot performance also on unseen tasks. Furthermore, fine-tuning these pruned models not only improves performance on original seen tasks but can recover held-out tasks' performance.

Superpixel segmentation can improve efficiency by reducing the number of data points to process. However, existing superpixel-based methods usually perform segmentation independently of the clustering task, often producing partitions that do not align with the subsequent clustering objective. To address this, we propose a unified end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes superpixel segmentation and subspace clustering. Its core is a feedback mechanism: a self-representation network based on unfolded Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) provides a model-driven signal to guide a differentiable superpixel module. This joint optimization yields clustering-aware partitions that preserve both spectral and spatial structure. Furthermore, our superpixel network learns a unique compactness parameter for each superpixel, enabling more flexible and adaptive segmentation.

To substantiate the claim, we (i) evaluate post-ISP and Bayer reconstruction pipelines, (ii) curate Raw-Rain, the first public benchmark of real rainy scenes captured in both 12-bit Bayer and bit-depth-matched sRGB, and (iii) introduce Information Conservation Score (ICS), a color-invariant metric that aligns more closely with human opinion than PSNR or SSIM. On the test split, our raw-domain model improves sRGB results by up to +0.99 dB PSNR and +1.2% ICS, while running faster with half of the GFLOPs.

Specifically, we first construct a differentiable atmospheric scattering model that decouples haze concentration from light degradation through a network with physical parameter estimation, enabling the learning of haze-mitigated feature representations. Second, we design an adaptive scanning state space model for feature extraction. Our adaptive Mamba variant achieves a 78% inference speed increase over native Mamba while preserving long-range dependency modeling. Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.",

Instead of learning a single prototype vector for each category as in existing methods such as SimGCD, we model each category using a set of basis vectors, forming a subspace representation that enables greater expressiveness and discrimination in a high-dimensional feature space. To guide the learning of such bases, we enforce two key constraints: (1) a basis orthogonality constraint that promotes inter-class separability, and (2) a reconstruction constraint that ensures each prototype basis can effectively reconstruct its corresponding class samples. Experimental results on real-world HSI demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art GCD methods, establishing a strong foundation for generalized category discovery in hyperspectral settings.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models have recently shown promising results for video super-resolution (VSR). However, directly adapting generative diffusion models to VSR can result in redundancy, since low-quality videos already preserve substantial content information. Such redundancy leads to increased computational overhead and learning burden, as the model performs superfluous operations and must learn to filter out irrelevant information. To address this problem, we propose OASIS, an efficient $\\textbf{o}$ne-step diffusion model with $\\textbf{a}$ttention $\\textbf{s}$pecialization for real-world v$\\textbf{i}$deo $\\textbf{s}$uper-resolution. OASIS incorporates an attention specialization routing that assigns attention heads to different patterns according to their intrinsic behaviors. This routing mitigates redundancy while effectively preserving pretrained knowledge, allowing diffusion models to better adapt to VSR and achieve stronger performance. Moreover, we propose a simple yet effective progressive training strategy, which starts with temporally consistent degradations and then shifts to inconsistent settings. This strategy facilitates learning under complex degradations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OASIS achieves state-of-the-art performance on both synthetic and real-world datasets. OASIS also provides superior inference speed, offering a $\\textbf{6.2$\\times$}$ speedup over one-step diffusion baselines such as SeedVR2.

        "summary": "Modern diffusion models generate realistic traffic simulations but systematically violate physical constraints. In a large-scale evaluation of SceneDiffuser++, a state-of-the-art traffic simulator, we find that 50% of generated trajectories violate basic physical laws - vehicles collide, drive off roads, and spawn inside buildings. This reveals a fundamental limitation: current models treat physical validity as an emergent property rather than an architectural requirement. We propose Validity-First Spatial Intelligence (VFSI), which enforces constraints through energy-based guidance during diffusion sampling, without model retraining. By incorporating collision avoidance and kinematic constraints as energy functions, we guide the denoising process toward physically valid trajectories. Across 200 urban scenarios from the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, VFSI reduces collision rates by 67% (24.6% to 8.1%) and improves overall validity by 87% (50.3% to 94.2%), while simultaneously improving realism metrics (ADE: 1.34m to 1.21m). Our model-agnostic approach demonstrates that explicit constraint enforcement during inference is both necessary and sufficient for physically valid traffic simulation.",

We present an intelligent classification method that couples an Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau (CDF9/7) wavelets whose detail coefficients are modulated by an n-scroll chaotic system to enrich discriminative features. We evaluate on the public DDTI thyroid ultrasound dataset (n = 1,638 images; 819 malignant / 819 benign) using 5-fold cross-validation, where the proposed method attains 98.17% accuracy, 98.76% sensitivity, 97.58% specificity, 97.55% F1-score, and an AUC of 0.9912. A controlled ablation shows that adding chaotic modulation to CDF9/7 improves accuracy by +8.79 percentage points over a CDF9/7-only CNN (from 89.38% to 98.17%). To objectively position our approach, we trained state-of-the-art backbones on the same data and splits: EfficientNetV2-S (96.58% accuracy; AUC 0.987), Swin-T (96.41%; 0.986), ViT-B/16 (95.72%; 0.983), and ConvNeXt-T (96.94%; 0.987). Our method outperforms the best of these by +1.23 points in accuracy and +0.0042 in AUC, while remaining computationally efficient (28.7 ms per image; 1,125 MB peak VRAM). Robustness is further supported by cross-dataset testing on TCIA (accuracy 95.82%) and transfer to an ISIC skin-lesion subset (n = 28 unique images, augmented to 2,048; accuracy 97.31%). Explainability analyses (Grad-CAM, SHAP, LIME) highlight clinically relevant regions.

        "summary": "World models simulate dynamic environments, enabling agents to interact with diverse input modalities. Although recent advances have improved the visual quality and temporal consistency of video world models, their ability of accurately modeling human-specified actions remains under-explored. Reinforcement learning presents a promising approach for directly improving the suboptimal action-following capability of pre-trained models, assuming that an appropriate reward function can be defined. However, transferring reinforcement learning post-training methods to world model is impractical due to the prohibitive cost of large-scale preference annotations and the infeasibility of constructing rule-based video verifiers. To address this gap, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Inverse Rewards (RLIR), a post-training framework that derives verifiable reward signals by recovering input actions from generated videos using an Inverse Dynamics Model. By mapping high-dimensional video modality to a low-dimensional action space, RLIR provides an objective and verifiable reward for optimization via Group Relative Policy Optimization. Experiments across autoregressive and diffusion paradigms demonstrate 5-10% gains in action-following, up to 10% improvements in visual quality, and higher human preference scores, establishing RLIR as the first post-training method specifically designed to enhance action-following in video world models.",

        "summary": "Automatic car damage detection has been a topic of significant interest for the auto insurance industry as it promises faster, accurate, and cost-effective damage assessments. However, few works have gone beyond 2D image analysis to leverage 3D reconstruction methods, which have the potential to provide a more comprehensive and geometrically accurate representation of the damage. Moreover, recent methods employing 3D representations for novel view synthesis, particularly 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS), have demonstrated the ability to generate accurate and coherent 3D reconstructions from a limited number of views. In this work we introduce an automatic car damage detection pipeline that performs 3D damage segmentation by up-lifting 2D masks. Additionally, we propose a simple yet effective learning-free approach for single-view 3D-GS segmentation. Specifically, Gaussians are projected onto the image plane using camera parameters obtained via Structure from Motion (SfM). They are then filtered through an algorithm that utilizes Z-buffering along with a normal distribution model of depth and opacities. Through experiments we found that this method is particularly effective for challenging scenarios like car damage detection, where target objects (e.g., scratches, small dents) may only be clearly visible in a single view, making multi-view consistency approaches impractical or impossible.

        "summary": "The established redundancy in visual tokens within large vision-language models allows pruning to effectively reduce their substantial computational demands. Previous methods typically employ heuristic layer-specific pruning strategies where, although the number of tokens removed may differ across decoder layers, the overall pruning schedule is fixed and applied uniformly to all input samples and tasks, failing to align token elimination with the model's holistic reasoning trajectory. Cognitive science indicates that human visual processing often begins with broad exploration to accumulate evidence before narrowing focus as the target becomes distinct. Our experiments reveal an analogous pattern in these models. This observation suggests that neither a fixed pruning schedule nor a heuristic layer-wise strategy can optimally accommodate the diverse complexities inherent in different inputs. To overcome this limitation, we introduce Complexity-Adaptive Pruning (AutoPrune), a training-free, plug-and-play framework that tailors pruning policies to varying sample and task complexities. Specifically, AutoPrune quantifies the mutual information between visual and textual tokens, then projects this signal to a budget-constrained logistic retention curve. Each such logistic curve, defined by its unique shape, corresponds to the specific complexity of different tasks and can guarantee adherence to predefined computational constraints. We evaluate AutoPrune on standard vision-language tasks and on Vision-Language-Action models for autonomous driving. Notably, when applied to LLaVA-1.5-7B, our method prunes 89% of visual tokens and reduces inference FLOPs by 76.8% while retaining 96.7% of the original accuracy averaged over all tasks. This corresponds to a 9.1% improvement over the recent work PDrop, demonstrating the effectiveness. Code is available at https://github.com/AutoLab-SAI-SJTU/AutoPrune.",

However, existing methods are mostly designed for RGB imagery, leaving a significant gap in modeling synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. SAR, with its all-day, all-weather imaging capabilities, plays an irreplaceable role in remote sensing scene understanding. To address this gap, this paper proposes SAR-KnowLIP, the first universal SAR multimodal foundational model, along with reusable data and evaluation baselines. Specifically: (1) This work introduces the critical yet long-overlooked attribute of geographic information into remote sensing research, constructing SAR-GEOVL-1M (the first large-scale SAR dataset with complete geographic projection properties), covering multiple satellite platforms, 120,000 images, and 135 cities. (2) Aligned structured text is generated through a hierarchical cognitive chain-of-thought (HCoT), providing more than one million multi-dimensional semantic annotations of landforms, regional functions, target attributes, and spatial relationships. (3) We design a Self-Consistent Iterative Optimization mechanism that continuously enhances cross-modal alignment through a self-supervised closed loop of contrastive, matching, and reconstruction learning on a transferable multimodal encoder. (4) A unified evaluation benchmark is established across 11 representative downstream vision and vision-language tasks, with comparisons against 14 leading foundation models, where SAR-KnowLIP demonstrates leading performance, particularly in object counting and land-cover classification. We expect that SAR-KnowLIP's large-scale multimodal data, transferable model architecture, and comprehensive experimental benchmark will significantly advance the development of SAR multimodal baseline models.",

        "summary": "Empirical evidence shows that deep vision networks represent concepts as directions in latent space, vectors we call concept embeddings. Each concept has a latent factor-a scalar-indicating its presence in an input patch. For a given patch, multiple latent factors are encoded into a compact representation by linearly combining concept embeddings, with the factors as coefficients. Since these embeddings enable such encoding, we call them encoding directions. A latent factor can be recovered via the inner product with a filter, a vector we call a decoding direction. These encoding-decoding direction pairs are not directly accessible, but recovering them helps open the black box of deep networks, enabling understanding, debugging, and improving models. Decoder directions attribute meaning to latent codes, while encoding directions assess concept influence on predictions, with both enabling model correction by unlearning irrelevant concepts. Unlike prior matrix decomposition, autoencoder, or dictionary learning methods that rely on feature reconstruction, we propose a new perspective: decoding directions are identified via directional clustering of activations, and encoding directions are estimated with signal vectors under a probabilistic view. We further leverage network weights through a novel technique, Uncertainty Region Alignment, which reveals interpretable directions affecting predictions. Our analysis shows that (a) on synthetic data, our method recovers ground-truth direction pairs; (b) on real data, decoding directions map to monosemantic, interpretable concepts and outperform unsupervised baselines; and (c) signal vectors faithfully estimate encoding directions, validated via activation maximization. Finally, we demonstrate applications in understanding global model behavior, explaining individual predictions, and intervening to produce counterfactuals or correct errors.",

These digital twins accurately replicate the traffic and environmental characteristics of their real-world counterparts, enabling more realistic simulations in CARLA. This evaluation is challenging due to the diversity of driving behaviors, locations, weather conditions, and times of day at complex urban intersections.

Although diffusion-based methods have become dominant, their property of modeling the entire image in latent space makes it challenging for the results to align well with prompt details and maintain a consistent background. To address these issues, we explore Mask AutoRegressive (MAR) models for this task. MAR naturally supports image inpainting by generating latent tokens corresponding to mask regions, enabling better local controllability without altering the background. However, directly applying MAR to this task makes the inpainting content either ignore the prompts or be disharmonious with the background context. Through analysis of the attention maps from the inpainting images, we identify the impact of background tokens on text tokens during the MAR generation, and leverage this to design \\textbf{Token Painter}, a training-free text-guided image inpainting method based on MAR. Our approach introduces two key components: (1) Dual-Stream Encoder Information Fusion (DEIF), which fuses the semantic and context information from text and background in frequency domain to produce novel guidance tokens, allowing MAR to generate text-faithful inpainting content while keeping harmonious with background context. (2) Adaptive Decoder Attention Score Enhancing (ADAE), which adaptively enhances attention scores on guidance tokens and inpainting tokens to further enhance the alignment of prompt details and the content visual quality.

        "summary": "As a general-purpose vision-language pretraining model, CLIP demonstrates strong generalization ability in image-text alignment tasks and has been widely adopted in downstream applications such as image classification and image-text retrieval. However, it struggles with fine-grained tasks such as object detection and semantic segmentation. While many variants aim to improve CLIP on these tasks, its robustness to adversarial perturbations remains underexplored. Understanding how adversarial examples transfer across tasks is key to assessing CLIP's generalization limits and security risks. In this work, we conduct a systematic empirical analysis of the cross-task transfer behavior of CLIP-based models on image-text retrieval, object detection, and semantic segmentation under adversarial perturbations. We find that adversarial examples generated from fine-grained tasks (e.g., object detection and semantic segmentation) often exhibit stronger transfer potential than those from coarse-grained tasks, enabling more effective attacks against the original CLIP model. Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel framework, Multi-Task Adversarial CLIP (MT-AdvCLIP), which introduces a task-aware feature aggregation loss and generates perturbations with enhanced cross-task generalization capability. This design strengthens the attack effectiveness of fine-grained task models on the shared CLIP backbone. Experimental results on multiple public datasets show that MT-AdvCLIP significantly improves the adversarial transfer success rate (The average attack success rate across multiple tasks is improved by over 39%.) against various CLIP-derived models, without increasing the perturbation budget. This study reveals the transfer mechanism of adversarial examples in multi-task CLIP models, offering new insights into multi-task robustness evaluation and adversarial example design.",

To facilitate research in MTL, this paper presents a systematic experimental analysis to dissect the factors contributing to this persistent problem. Our investigation confirms that the performance of existing optimization methods varies inconsistently across datasets, and advanced architectures still rely on costly grid-searched loss weights. Furthermore, we show that while powerful Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) provide strong initialization, they do not inherently resolve the optimization imbalance, and merely increasing data quantity offers limited benefits. A crucial finding emerges from our analysis: a strong correlation exists between the optimization imbalance and the norm of task-specific gradients. We demonstrate that this insight is directly applicable, showing that a straightforward strategy of scaling task losses according to their gradient norms can achieve performance comparable to that of an extensive and computationally expensive grid search. Our comprehensive analysis suggests that understanding and controlling gradient dynamics is a more direct path to stable MTL than developing increasingly complex methods.",

        "summary": "Modeling and generating human reactions poses a significant challenge with broad applications for computer vision and human-computer interaction. Existing methods either treat multiple individuals as a single entity, directly generating interactions, or rely solely on one person's motion to generate the other's reaction, failing to integrate the rich semantic information that underpins human interactions. Yet, these methods often fall short in adaptive responsiveness, i.e., the ability to accurately respond to diverse and dynamic interaction scenarios. Recognizing this gap, our work introduces an approach tailored to address the limitations of existing models by focusing on text-driven human reaction generation. Our model specifically generates realistic motion sequences for individuals that responding to the other's actions based on a descriptive text of the interaction scenario. The goal is to produce motion sequences that not only complement the opponent's movements but also semantically fit the described interactions. To achieve this, we present MoReact, a diffusion-based method designed to disentangle the generation of global trajectories and local motions sequentially. This approach stems from the observation that generating global trajectories first is crucial for guiding local motion, ensuring better alignment with given action and text. Furthermore, we introduce a novel interaction loss to enhance the realism of generated close interactions. Our experiments, utilizing data adapted from a two-person motion dataset, demonstrate the efficacy of our approach for this novel task, which is capable of producing realistic, diverse, and controllable reactions that not only closely match the movements of the counterpart but also adhere to the textual guidance.

        "summary": "Instruction-guided image editing has achieved remarkable progress, yet current models still face challenges with complex instructions and often require multiple samples to produce a desired result. Reinforcement Learning (RL) offers a promising solution, but its adoption in image editing has been severely hindered by the lack of a high-fidelity, efficient reward signal. In this work, we present a comprehensive methodology to overcome this barrier, centered on the development of a state-of-the-art, specialized reward model. We first introduce EditReward-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark to systematically evaluate reward models on editing quality. Building on this benchmark, we develop EditScore, a series of reward models (7B-72B) for evaluating the quality of instruction-guided image editing. Through meticulous data curation and filtering, EditScore effectively matches the performance of learning proprietary VLMs. Furthermore, coupled with an effective self-ensemble strategy tailored for the generative nature of EditScore, our largest variant even surpasses GPT-5 in the benchmark. We then demonstrate that a high-fidelity reward model is the key to unlocking online RL for image editing. Our experiments show that, while even the largest open-source VLMs fail to provide an effective learning signal, EditScore enables efficient and robust policy optimization. Applying our framework to a strong base model, OmniGen2, results in a final model that shows a substantial and consistent performance uplift. Overall, this work provides the first systematic path from benchmarking to reward modeling to RL training in image editing, showing that a high-fidelity, domain-specialized reward model is the key to unlocking the full potential of RL in this domain.",

However, the imbalance of medical resources, data corruption or improper data preservation may lead to a situation where different clients possess medical images of different modality. This heterogeneity poses a significant challenge for cross-domain medical image segmentation within the federated learning framework. To address this challenge, we propose a new Federated Domain Adaptation (FedDA) segmentation training framework. Specifically, we propose a feature-level adversarial learning among clients by aligning feature maps across clients through embedding an adversarial training mechanism. This design can enhance the model's generalization on multiple domains and alleviate the negative impact from domain-shift. Comprehensive experiments on three medical image datasets demonstrate that our proposed FedDA substantially achieves cross-domain federated aggregation, endowing single modality client with cross-modality processing capabilities, and consistently delivers robust performance compared to state-of-the-art federated aggregation algorithms in objective and subjective assessment.

The model takes in features from medical images and related text, then shifts them into the frequency domain using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This helps it focus on more meaningful data and filter out noise or less useful information. To improve accuracy and ensure that answers are based on real knowledge, we add a quantum inspired retrieval system. It fetches useful medical facts from external sources using quantum-based similarity techniques. These details are then merged with the frequency-based features for stronger reasoning. We evaluated our model using the VQA-RAD dataset, which includes real radiology images and questions. The results showed that Q-FSRU outperforms earlier models, especially on complex cases needing image text reasoning. The mix of frequency and quantum information improves both performance and explainability. Overall, this approach offers a promising way to build smart, clear, and helpful AI tools for doctors.",

However, the impact of this coordination in activity understanding has not been systematically evaluated due to the lack of suitable datasets. Such evaluation demands kinematic-level annotations (e.g., 3D pose) for the hands and body, yet existing 3D activity datasets typically annotate either hand or body pose. Another line of work employs marker-based motion capture to provide full-body pose, but the physical markers introduce visual artifacts, thereby limiting models' generalization to natural, markerless videos. To address these limitations, we present AssemblyHands-X, the first markerless 3D hand-body benchmark for bimanual activities, designed to study the effect of hand-body coordination for action recognition. We begin by constructing a pipeline for 3D pose annotation from synchronized multi-view videos. Our approach combines multi-view triangulation with SMPL-X mesh fitting, yielding reliable 3D registration of hands and upper body. We then validate different input representations (e.g., video, hand pose, body pose, or hand-body pose) across recent action recognition models based on graph convolution or spatio-temporal attention. Our extensive experiments show that pose-based action inference is more efficient and accurate than video baselines. Moreover, joint modeling of hand and body cues improves action recognition over using hands or upper body alone, highlighting the importance of modeling interdependent hand-body dynamics for a holistic understanding of bimanual activities.",

Even the more concerned diffusion models need to learn the distribution of clean data for reconstruction, which is difficult to satisfy in medical clinical applications. At the same time, self-supervised-based methods face the challenge of significant degradation of generalizability of models pre-trained for the current dose to expand to other doses. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel method of tunable-generalization diffusion powered by self-supervised contextual sub-data for low-dose CT reconstruction, named SuperDiff. Firstly, a contextual subdata similarity adaptive sensing strategy is designed for denoising centered on the LDCT projection domain, which provides an initial prior for the subsequent progress. Subsequently, the initial prior is used to combine knowledge distillation with a deep combination of latent diffusion models for optimizing image details. The pre-trained model is used for inference reconstruction, and the pixel-level self-correcting fusion technique is proposed for fine-grained reconstruction of the image domain to enhance the image fidelity, using the initial prior and the LDCT image as a guide. In addition, the technique is flexibly applied to the generalization of upper and lower doses or even unseen doses. Dual-domain strategy cascade for self-supervised LDCT denoising, SuperDiff requires only LDCT projection domain data for training and testing. Full qualitative and quantitative evaluations on both datasets and real data show that SuperDiff consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in terms of reconstruction and generalization performance.",

Recent studies adopt pseudo-label-based teacher-student frameworks and demonstrate impressive performance. The main challenge of these frameworks is in selecting high-quality pseudo-labels from the teacher's predictions. Most previous methods, however, select pseudo-labels by comparing confidence scores over thresholds manually set. The latest works tackle the challenge either by dynamic thresholding or refining the quality of pseudo-labels. Such methods still overlook contextual information e.g. object distances, classes, and learning states, and inadequately assess the pseudo-label quality using partial information available from the networks. In this work, we propose a novel SS3DOD framework featuring a learnable pseudo-labeling module designed to automatically and adaptively select high-quality pseudo-labels. Our approach introduces two networks at the teacher output level. These networks reliably assess the quality of pseudo-labels by the score fusion and determine context-adaptive thresholds, which are supervised by the alignment of pseudo-labels over GT bounding boxes. Additionally, we introduce a soft supervision strategy that can learn robustly under pseudo-label noises. This helps the student network prioritize cleaner labels over noisy ones in semi-supervised learning. Extensive experiments on the KITTI and Waymo datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. The proposed method selects high-precision pseudo-labels while maintaining a wider coverage of contexts and a higher recall rate, significantly improving relevant SS3DOD methods.",

Building on these insights, we propose a simple yet powerful baseline, Sim-DETR, which extends the standard DETR with two minor modifications in the decoder layers: (1) constraining self-attention between queries based on their semantic and positional overlap and (2) adding query-to-frame alignment to bridge the global and local contexts.

Existing methods, primarily based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), excel at capturing local texture but struggle with global facial harmony, while Vision Transformers (ViTs) effectively model long-range dependencies but can miss fine-grained details. Furthermore, models trained on benchmark datasets can inadvertently learn and perpetuate societal biases related to protected attributes like ethnicity. To address these interconnected challenges, we propose \\textbf{FairViT-GAN}, a novel hybrid framework that synergistically integrates a CNN branch for local feature extraction and a ViT branch for global context modeling. More significantly, we introduce an adversarial debiasing mechanism where the feature extractor is explicitly trained to produce representations that are invariant to protected attributes, thereby actively mitigating algorithmic bias. Our framework's transparency is enhanced by visualizing the distinct focus of each architectural branch. Extensive experiments on the SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark demonstrate that FairViT-GAN not only sets a new state-of-the-art in predictive accuracy, achieving a Pearson Correlation of \\textbf{0.9230} and reducing RMSE to \\textbf{0.2650}, but also excels in fairness.

It employs a branched network that shares activation maps with an image classifier and learns to mimic the embeddings of a Vision and Language Model (VLM). The branch network predicts concepts in an image, and their corresponding regions are represented by a weighted sum of activation maps, with weights given by the gradients of the concept prediction scores. Their contributions are quantified based on their impact on the image classification score. Our method provides a general framework for identifying the concept regions and their contributions while leveraging VLM knowledge to handle arbitrary concepts without requiring an annotated dataset.

        "summary": "Recent advances in Text-to-3D (T23D) generative models have enabled the synthesis of diverse, high-fidelity 3D assets from textual prompts. However, existing challenges restrict the development of reliable T23D quality assessment (T23DQA). First, existing benchmarks are outdated, fragmented, and coarse-grained, making fine-grained metric training infeasible. Moreover, current objective metrics exhibit inherent design limitations, resulting in non-representative feature extraction and diminished metric robustness. To address these limitations, we introduce T23D-CompBench, a comprehensive benchmark for compositional T23D generation. We define five components with twelve sub-components for compositional prompts, which are used to generate 3,600 textured meshes from ten state-of-the-art generative models. A large-scale subjective experiment is conducted to collect 129,600 reliable human ratings across different perspectives. Based on T23D-CompBench, we further propose Rank2Score, an effective evaluator with two-stage training for T23DQA. Rank2Score enhances pairwise training via supervised contrastive regression and curriculum learning in the first stage, and subsequently refines predictions using mean opinion scores to achieve closer alignment with human judgments in the second stage. Extensive experiments and downstream applications demonstrate that Rank2Score consistently outperforms existing metrics across multiple dimensions and can additionally serve as a reward function to optimize generative models.

Previous methods rely heavily on appearance-based pattern matching and thus exhibit limited robustness against challenges such as drastic visual changes, occlusions, and scene shifts. This failure is often attributed to a lack of high-level conceptual understanding of the target. The recently proposed Segment Concept (SeC) framework mitigated this limitation by using a Large Vision-Language Model (LVLM) to establish a deep semantic understanding of the object for more persistent segmentation. In this work, we evaluate its zero-shot performance on the challenging coMplex video Object SEgmentation v2 (MOSEv2) dataset. Without any fine-tuning on the training set, SeC achieved 39.7 \\JFn on the test set and ranked 2nd place in the Complex VOS track of the 7th Large-scale Video Object Segmentation Challenge.",

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in 2D scene understanding and generation, but extending this unification to the physical world remains an open challenge. Existing 3D and 4D approaches typically embed scene geometry into autoregressive model for semantic understanding and diffusion model for content generation. This paradigm gap prevents a single model from jointly handling both tasks, especially in dynamic 4D settings where spatiotemporal modeling is critical. We propose Uni4D-LLM, the first unified VLM framework with spatiotemporal awareness for 4D scene understanding and generation. Our design is guided by two key insights: 1) Unification requires a shared representation. We extract semantic features for understanding and noisy-injected appearance features for generation, incorporate 4D geometric cues, and fuse them into a spatiotemporal-aware visual representation through adaptive cross-attention. 2) Unification requires a shared architecture. Both autoregression and diffusion are built on Transformer backbones, and this enables integration into a single LLM with task-specific heads. By aligning visual and linguistic representations, our Uni4D-LLM produces predictions for both understanding and generation within one Transformer-based framework. We further apply instruction fine-tuning on diverse 4D vision-language datasets to improve generalization across tasks. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that Uni4D-LLM achieves competitive or superior results compared to state-of-the-art models and offers the first true unification of 4D scene understanding and generation.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive abilities in reasoning, text comprehension, contextual pattern recognition, and integrating language with visual understanding. While these advances offer significant benefits, they also reveal critical limitations in the models' ability to grasp the notion of privacy. There is hence substantial interest in determining if and how these models can understand and enforce privacy principles, particularly given the lack of supporting resources to test such a task. In this work, we address these challenges by examining how legal frameworks can inform the capabilities of these emerging technologies. To this end, we introduce a comprehensive, multi-level Visual Privacy Taxonomy that captures a wide range of privacy issues, designed to be scalable and adaptable to existing and future research needs. Furthermore, we evaluate the capabilities of several state-of-the-art Vision-Language Models (VLMs), revealing significant inconsistencies in their understanding of contextual privacy.

Existing solutions often rely on single-view imaging or manual inspection, which are prone to errors due to occlusions, restricted perspectives, or lighting inconsistencies. These limitations require the installation of additional inspection stations, which could disrupt the assembly line and lead to increased downtime and costs. This paper introduces a novel multi-view quality control module designed to address these challenges, integrating a multi-camera imaging system with advanced object detection algorithms. By capturing images from three camera views, the system provides comprehensive visual coverage of components of an assembly process. A tailored image fusion methodology combines results from multiple views, effectively resolving ambiguities and enhancing detection reliability. To support this system, we developed a unique dataset comprising annotated images across diverse scenarios, including varied lighting conditions, occlusions, and angles, to enhance applicability in real-world manufacturing environments. Experimental results show that our approach significantly outperforms single-view methods, achieving high precision and recall rates in the identification of improperly fastened small assembly parts such as screws. This work contributes to industrial automation by overcoming single-view limitations, and providing a scalable, cost-effective, and accurate quality control mechanism that ensures the reliability and safety of the assembly line.

To resolve this issue, we propose Group Context Optimization (GroupCoOp), a simple and effective debiased fine-tuning algorithm that enhances the group robustness of fine-tuned VLMs. Its key idea is to employ group-specific text prompts as group representatives serving as multiple classifiers for their target class. The rich semantic knowledge of the text encoder of VLM enables the discovery of effective group prompts even for groups with a small number of training samples. Leveraging the group prompts for each class addresses the issues caused by the group-imbalanced training set, such as the neglect of minority groups and the scattered distribution of each class in the embedding space. GroupCoOp achieved the best results on five benchmarks across five CLIP architectures and occasionally outperformed prior methods that fine-tune the entire network, despite training only 0.016\\% of the network's parameters.",

However, existing VQ-based methods simply encode visual features with nearest codebook items and train index predictor with code-level supervision. Due to the richness of visual signal, VQ encoding often leads to large quantization error. Furthermore, training predictor with code-level supervision can not take the final reconstruction errors into consideration, result in sub-optimal prior modeling accuracy. In this paper we address the above two issues and propose a Texture Vector-Quantization and a Reconstruction Aware Prediction strategy. The texture vector-quantization strategy leverages the task character of super-resolution and only introduce codebook to model the prior of missing textures. While the reconstruction aware prediction strategy makes use of the straight-through estimator to directly train index predictor with image-level supervision.

        "summary": "Graph-based models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for modeling multimodal urban data and learning region representations for various downstream tasks. However, existing approaches face two major limitations. (1) They typically employ identical graph neural network architectures across all modalities, failing to capture modality-specific structures and characteristics. (2) During the fusion stage, they often neglect spatial heterogeneity by assuming that the aggregation weights of different modalities remain invariant across regions, resulting in suboptimal representations. To address these issues, we propose MTGRR, a modality-tailored graph modeling framework for urban region representation, built upon a multimodal dataset comprising point of interest (POI), taxi mobility, land use, road element, remote sensing, and street view images. (1) MTGRR categorizes modalities into two groups based on spatial density and data characteristics: aggregated-level and point-level modalities. For aggregated-level modalities, MTGRR employs a mixture-of-experts (MoE) graph architecture, where each modality is processed by a dedicated expert GNN to capture distinct modality-specific characteristics. For the point-level modality, a dual-level GNN is constructed to extract fine-grained visual semantic features. (2) To obtain effective region representations under spatial heterogeneity, a spatially-aware multimodal fusion mechanism is designed to dynamically infer region-specific modality fusion weights. Building on this graph modeling framework, MTGRR further employs a joint contrastive learning strategy that integrates region aggregated-level, point-level, and fusion-level objectives to optimize region representations. Experiments on two real-world datasets across six modalities and three tasks demonstrate that MTGRR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness.",

However, current methods face critical limitations on two fronts: on the construction side, both handcrafted and generative augmentations often suffer from limited diversity and risk semantic corruption; on the learning side, the absence of a quality assessment mechanism leads to suboptimal supervision where all pairs are treated equally. To tackle these challenges, we propose GenView++, a unified framework that addresses both fronts by introducing two synergistic innovations. To improve pair construction, GenView++ introduces a multi-source adaptive view generation mechanism to synthesize diverse yet semantically coherent views by dynamically modulating generative parameters across image-conditioned, text-conditioned, and image-text-conditioned strategies. Second, a quality-driven contrastive learning mechanism assesses each pair's semantic alignment and diversity to dynamically reweight their training contribution, prioritizing high-quality pairs while suppressing redundant or misaligned pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GenView++ across both vision and vision-language tasks. For vision representation learning, it improves MoCov2 by +2.5% on ImageNet linear classification. For vision-language learning, it raises the average zero-shot classification accuracy by +12.31% over CLIP and +5.31% over SLIP across ten datasets, and further improves Flickr30k text retrieval R@5 by +3.2%.

        "summary": "Visual pointing, which aims to localize a target by predicting its coordinates on an image, has emerged as an important problem in the realm of vision-language models (VLMs). Despite its broad applicability, recent benchmarks show that current VLMs still fall far behind human performance on this task. A key limitation is that VLMs are typically required to complete the pointing task in a single step, akin to asking humans to point at an object without seeing their own fingers. To address this issue, we propose a simple yet effective self-refining procedure: Point, Visualize, then Refine (Poivre). This procedure enables a VLM to first mark its estimated point, then iteratively refine the coordinates if necessary. Inspired by advances of reasoning models in the natural language domain, we employ reinforcement learning (RL) to incentivize this self-refining ability. For the RL training, we design a neat process reward that is not only empirically effective but also grounded in appealing properties. Our trained model, Poivre-7B, sets a new state of the art on Point-Bench, outperforming both proprietary models such as Gemini-2.5-Pro and large open-source models such as Molmo-72B by over 3%.

        "summary": "This paper explores the problem of class-agnostic anomaly detection (AD), where the objective is to train one class-agnostic AD model that can generalize to detect anomalies in diverse new classes from different domains without any retraining or fine-tuning on the target data. When applied for new classes, the performance of current single- and multi-class AD methods is still unsatisfactory. One fundamental reason is that representation learning in existing methods is still class-related, namely, feature correlation. To address this issue, we propose residual features and construct a simple but effective framework, termed ResAD. Our core insight is to learn the residual feature distribution rather than the initial feature distribution. Residual features are formed by matching and then subtracting normal reference features. In this way, we can effectively realize feature decorrelation. Even in new classes, the distribution of normal residual features would not remarkably shift from the learned distribution. In addition, we think that residual features still have one issue: scale correlation. To this end, we propose a feature hypersphere constraining approach, which learns to constrain initial normal residual features into a spatial hypersphere for enabling the feature scales of different classes as consistent as possible. Furthermore, we propose a novel logbarrier bidirectional contraction OCC loss and vector quantization based feature distribution matching module to enhance ResAD, leading to the improved version of ResAD (ResAD++). Comprehensive experiments on eight real-world AD datasets demonstrate that our ResAD++ can achieve remarkable AD results when directly used in new classes, outperforming state-of-the-art competing methods and also surpassing ResAD.

        "summary": "DUSt3R-based end-to-end scene reconstruction has recently shown promising results in dense visual SLAM. However, most existing methods only use image pairs to estimate pointmaps, overlooking spatial memory and global consistency.To this end, we introduce GRS-SLAM3R, an end-to-end SLAM framework for dense scene reconstruction and pose estimation from RGB images without any prior knowledge of the scene or camera parameters. Unlike existing DUSt3R-based frameworks, which operate on all image pairs and predict per-pair point maps in local coordinate frames, our method supports sequentialized input and incrementally estimates metric-scale point clouds in the global coordinate. In order to improve consistent spatial correlation, we use a latent state for spatial memory and design a transformer-based gated update module to reset and update the spatial memory that continuously aggregates and tracks relevant 3D information across frames. Furthermore, we partition the scene into submaps, apply local alignment within each submap, and register all submaps into a common world frame using relative constraints, producing a globally consistent map. Experiments on various datasets show that our framework achieves superior reconstruction accuracy while maintaining real-time performance.",

        "summary": "In this work, we present HieraTok, a novel multi-scale Vision Transformer (ViT)-based tokenizer that overcomes the inherent limitation of modeling single-scale representations. This is realized through two key designs: (1) multi-scale downsampling applied to the token map generated by the tokenizer encoder, producing a sequence of multi-scale tokens, and (2) a scale-causal attention mechanism that enables the progressive flow of information from low-resolution global semantic features to high-resolution structural details. Coupling these designs, HieraTok achieves significant improvements in both image reconstruction and generation tasks. Under identical settings, the multi-scale visual tokenizer outperforms its single-scale counterpart by a 27.2\\% improvement in rFID ($1.47 \\rightarrow 1.07$). When integrated into downstream generation frameworks, it achieves a $1.38\\times$ faster convergence rate and an 18.9\\% boost in gFID ($16.4 \\rightarrow 13.3$), which may be attributed to the smoother and more uniformly distributed latent space. Furthermore, by scaling up the tokenizer's training, we demonstrate its potential by a sota rFID of 0.45 and a gFID of 1.82 among ViT tokenizers. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to introduce multi-scale ViT-based tokenizer in image reconstruction and image generation. We hope our findings and designs advance the ViT-based tokenizers in visual generation tasks.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) with multimodal capabilities have revolutionized vision-language tasks, but their deployment often requires huge memory and computational resources. While post-training quantization (PTQ) has successfully compressed language models to as low as 1-bit precision without significant performance loss, its effectiveness for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we present the first study on ultra-low bit (<4-bit) quantization for multimodal LLMs. Our analysis reveals that multimodal tokens and intermediate layer activations produced by them exhibit significantly higher statistical variance and entropy compared to text tokens, making them less tolerant to ultra-low bit quantization. However, the activation distributions of multimodal tokens varies significantly over different layers, with some layers having lower entropy activation distributions. We empirically show that such layers in these models can better tolerate ultra-low bit quantization. Building on these insights, we propose a novel strategy for MLLM quantization, LUQ: Layerwise Ultra-Low Bit Quantization, which selectively applies ultra-low bit quantization to layers that are more resilient to it. Additionally, we also show that using a mix of multimodal tokens (image and text) for PTQ boosts VQA performance in the ultra-low bit regime. We evaluate our method on LLaVA-1.5 and Qwen-2.5-VL across 9 popular VQA benchmarks. The resulting LUQ models use 40% and 31% less memory than their 4-bit counterparts, respectively, while exhibiting a performance degradation of less than 10% on the MME benchmark.",

It not only provides a structural blueprint for ensuring physical plausibility but also supports semantic controllability and interactive editing. However, the learning capabilities of current 3D indoor layout generation models are constrained by the limited scale, diversity, and annotation quality of existing datasets. To address this, we introduce M3DLayout, a large-scale, multi-source dataset for 3D indoor layout generation. M3DLayout comprises 15,080 layouts and over 258k object instances, integrating three distinct sources: real-world scans, professional CAD designs, and procedurally generated scenes. Each layout is paired with detailed structured text describing global scene summaries, relational placements of large furniture, and fine-grained arrangements of smaller items. This diverse and richly annotated resource enables models to learn complex spatial and semantic patterns across a wide variety of indoor environments. To assess the potential of M3DLayout, we establish a benchmark using a text-conditioned diffusion model. Experimental results demonstrate that our dataset provides a solid foundation for training layout generation models. Its multi-source composition enhances diversity, notably through the Inf3DLayout subset which provides rich small-object information, enabling the generation of more complex and detailed scenes. We hope that M3DLayout can serve as a valuable resource for advancing research in text-driven 3D scene synthesis.",

For the TimeScope (Long) dataset, which has the longest videos, the accuracy for video question answering is improved by up to 19.4\\%. Overall, our method raises the bar for long video understanding models. We will make our code available upon acceptance.",

However, their potential for point cloud completion remains underexplored due to the unstructured and irregular nature of point clouds. In this work, we propose DiffPCN, a novel diffusion-based coarse-to-fine framework for point cloud completion. Our approach comprises two stages: an initial stage for generating coarse point clouds, and a refinement stage that improves their quality through point denoising and upsampling. Specifically, we first project the unordered and irregular partial point cloud into structured depth images, which serve as conditions for a well-designed DepthLDM to synthesize completed multi-view depth images that are used to form coarse point clouds. In this way, our DiffPCN can yield high-quality and high-completeness coarse point clouds by leveraging LDM' s powerful generation and comprehension capabilities. Then, since LDMs inevitably introduce outliers into the generated depth maps, we design a Point Denoising Network to remove artifacts from the coarse point cloud by predicting a per-point distance score. Finally, we devise an Association-Aware Point Upsampler, which guides the upsampling process by leveraging local association features between the input point cloud and the corresponding coarse points, further yielding a dense and high-fidelity output. Experimental results demonstrate that our DiffPCN achieves state-of-the-art performance in geometric accuracy and shape completeness, significantly improving the robustness and consistency of point cloud completion.",

Current diagnostic workflows are complex and heavily reliant on neurologists' expertise, often resulting in delays in early detection and missed opportunities for timely intervention. To address these issues, we propose an end-to-end automated diagnostic method for PD, termed PD-Diag-Net, which performs risk assessment and auxiliary diagnosis directly from raw MRI scans. This framework first introduces an MRI Pre-processing Module (MRI-Processor) to mitigate inter-subject and inter-scanner variability by flexibly integrating established medical imaging preprocessing tools. It then incorporates two forms of clinical prior knowledge: (1) Brain-Region-Relevance-Prior (Relevance-Prior), which specifies brain regions strongly associated with PD; and (2) Brain-Region-Aging-Prior (Aging-Prior), which reflects the accelerated aging typically observed in PD-associated regions. Building on these priors, we design two dedicated modules: the Relevance-Prior Guided Feature Aggregation Module (Aggregator), which guides the model to focus on PD-associated regions at the inter-subject level, and the Age-Prior Guided Diagnosis Module (Diagnoser), which leverages brain age gaps as auxiliary constraints at the intra-subject level to enhance diagnostic accuracy and clinical interpretability. Furthermore, we collected external test data from our collaborating hospital. Experimental results show that PD-Diag-Net achieves 86\\% accuracy on external tests and over 96% accuracy in early-stage diagnosis, outperforming existing advanced methods by more than 20%.",

CrimEdit also extends these two task prompts to be applied to spatially distinct regions, enabling object movement (repositioning) within a single denoising step. By employing both guidance techniques, extensive experiments show that CrimEdit achieves superior object removal, controllable effect insertion, and efficient object movement without requiring additional training or separate removal and insertion stages.",

Previous works proves that query-based instance-level interaction reduces bandwidth demands and manual priors, however, LiDAR-focused implementations in collaborative perception remain underdeveloped, with performance still trailing state-of-the-art approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose INSTINCT (INSTance-level INteraCtion ArchiTecture), a novel collaborative perception framework featuring three core components: 1) a quality-aware filtering mechanism for high-quality instance feature selection; 2) a dual-branch detection routing scheme to decouple collaboration-irrelevant and collaboration-relevant instances; and 3) a Cross Agent Local Instance Fusion module to aggregate local hybrid instance features. Additionally, we enhance the ground truth (GT) sampling technique to facilitate training with diverse hybrid instance features. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that INSTINCT achieves superior performance.

While single-model detectors are advanced, they often lack robustness in these challenging conditions. This paper presents the hypothesis that ensemble of Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) models with diverse feature extraction backbones can significantly enhance detection robustness. To leverage diverse feature representations, individual SSD models were trained using a selection of backbone networks: VGG16, ResNet50, EfficientNet, and MobileNetV3. The study is conducted on a dataset consisting of images of three distinct weapon classes: guns, heavy weapons and knives. The predictions from these models are combined using the Weighted Boxes Fusion (WBF) method, an ensemble technique designed to optimize bounding box accuracy. Our key finding is that the fusion strategy is as critical as the ensemble's diversity, a WBF approach using a 'max' confidence scoring strategy achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 0.838. This represents a 2.948% relative improvement over the best-performing single model and consistently outperforms other fusion heuristics. This research offers a robust approach to enhancing real-time weapon detection capabilities in surveillance applications by demonstrating that confidence-aware fusion is a key mechanism for improving accuracy metrics of ensembles.",

Although knowledge distillation and sparse attention mechanisms can improve efficiency, they often fall short of delivering the high segmentation accuracy necessary for complex tasks. Balancing model performance with computational efficiency remains a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a novel 3D multi-modal image segmentation framework, termed MSD-KMamba, which integrates bidirectional spatial perception with multi-scale self-distillation. The bidirectional spatial aware branch effectively captures long-range spatial context dependencies across brain regions, while also incorporating a powerful nonlinear feature extraction mechanism that further enhances the model's ability to learn complex and heterogeneous patterns. In addition, the proposed multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy strengthens hierarchical feature representations and improves the transfer of semantic information at different resolution levels. By jointly leveraging the bidirectional spatial perception branch and the multi-scale self-distilled fusion strategy, our framework effectively mitigates the bottleneck of quadratic computational complexity in volumetric segmentation, while simultaneously addressing the limitation of insufficient global perception. Extensive experiments on multiple standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that MSD-KMamba consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in segmentation accuracy, robustness, and generalization, while maintaining high computational efficiency and favorable scalability.

However, current methods suffer from prohibitive computational costs due to processing massive spatiotemporal tokens across video frames.

In this paper, we propose a spatiotemporal information mining token merging (STIM-TM) method, representing the first dedicated approach for surgical video understanding. STIM-TM introduces a decoupled strategy that reduces token redundancy along temporal and spatial dimensions independently. Specifically, the temporal component merges spatially corresponding tokens from consecutive frames using saliency weighting, preserving critical sequential information and maintaining continuity. Meanwhile, the spatial component prioritizes merging static tokens through temporal stability analysis, protecting dynamic regions containing essential surgical information. Operating in a training-free manner, STIM-TM achieves significant efficiency gains with over $65\\%$ GFLOPs reduction while preserving competitive accuracy across comprehensive surgical video tasks. Our method also supports efficient training of long-sequence surgical videos, addressing computational bottlenecks in surgical applications.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown strong capabilities on diverse multimodal tasks. However, the large number of visual tokens output by the vision encoder severely hinders inference efficiency, and prior studies have shown that many of these tokens are not important and can therefore be safely pruned. In this work, we propose HIVTP, a training-free method to improve VLMs efficiency via hierarchical visual token pruning using a novel middle-layer-based importance score. Specifically, we utilize attention maps extracted from the middle layers of the vision encoder, which better reflect fine-grained and object-level attention, to estimate visual token importance. Based on this, we propose a hierarchical visual token pruning method to retain both globally and locally important visual tokens. Specifically, we reshape the 1-D visual token sequence output by the vision encoder into a 2-D spatial layout. In the global retaining stage, we divide the image into regions and retain tokens with higher importance scores in each region; in the local retaining stage, we then divide the image into small windows and retain the most important token in each local window. Experimental results show that our proposed method, HIVTP, can reduce the time-to-first-token (TTFT) of LLaVA-v1.5-7B and LLaVA-Next-7B by up to 50.0% and 55.1%, respectively, and improve the token generation throughput by up to 60.9% and 47.3%, without sacrificing accuracy, and even achieving improvements on certain benchmarks. Compared with prior works, HIVTP achieves better accuracy while offering higher inference efficiency.",

The LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 release comprises three primary components: (1) Large-Scale Curated Datasets: We construct an 85M concept-balanced pretraining dataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Mid-Traning and a meticulously curated 26M instruction dataset LLaVA-OneVision-1.5-Instruct, collectively encompassing 64B compressed multimodal tokens. (2) Efficient Training Framework: We develop a complete end-to-end efficient training framework leveraging an offline parallel data packing strategy to facilitate the training of LLaVA-OneVision-1.5 within a $16,000 budget. (3) State-of-the-art Performance: Experimental results demonstrate that LLaVA-OneVision1.5 yields exceptionally competitive performance across a broad range of downstream tasks.

To address this, we introduce ReWatch, a large-scale dataset built to foster advanced video reasoning. We propose a novel multi-stage synthesis pipeline to synthesize its three components: ReWatch-Caption, ReWatch-QA, and ReWatch-CoT. A core innovation is our Multi-Agent ReAct framework for CoT synthesis, which simulates a human-like \"re-watching\" process to generate video-grounded reasoning traces by explicitly modeling information retrieval and verification. Building on this dataset, we develop ReWatch-R1 by post-training a strong baseline LVLM with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and our RLVR framework. This framework incorporates a novel Observation \\& Reasoning (O\\&R) reward mechanism that evaluates both the final answer's correctness and the reasoning's alignment with video content, directly penalizing hallucination.

The key to our approach is a shared, lighting-invariant color-pair feature representation that forms a consistent foundation for both stages.

In this work, we propose Sparse-Up, a memory-efficient, high-fidelity texture modeling framework that effectively preserves high-frequency details. We use sparse voxels to guide texture reconstruction and ensure multi-view consistency, while leveraging surface anchoring and view-domain partitioning to break through resolution constraints. Surface anchoring employs a learnable upsampling strategy to constrain voxels to the mesh surface, eliminating over 70% of redundant voxels present in traditional voxel upsampling. View-domain partitioning introduces an image patch-guided voxel partitioning scheme, supervising and back-propagating gradients only on visible local patches. Through these two strategies, we can significantly reduce memory consumption during high-resolution voxel training without sacrificing geometric consistency, while preserving high-frequency details in textures.",

Across these directions, we observe a unifying trend: a paradigm shift from static, pre-built maps to dynamic, sensor-driven perception. Specifically, traditional static maps have provided semantic context for autonomous systems. However, they are costly to construct, difficult to update in real time, and lack generalization across regions, limiting their scalability. In contrast, dynamic representations leverage on-board sensor data for real-time map construction and topology reasoning. Each of the four research directions contributes to this shift through compact spatial modeling, semantic relational reasoning, robust domain knowledge integration, and multimodal scene understanding powered by pre-trained language models. Together, they pave the way for more adaptive, scalable, and explainable autonomous driving systems.",

        "summary": "This paper explores a novel lightweight approach LightFair to achieve fair text-to-image diffusion models (T2I DMs) by addressing the adverse effects of the text encoder. Most existing methods either couple different parts of the diffusion model for full-parameter training or rely on auxiliary networks for correction. They incur heavy training or sampling burden and unsatisfactory performance. Since T2I DMs consist of multiple components, with the text encoder being the most fine-tunable and front-end module, this paper focuses on mitigating bias by fine-tuning text embeddings. To validate feasibility, we observe that the text encoder's neutral embedding output shows substantial skewness across image embeddings of various attributes in the CLIP space. More importantly, the noise prediction network further amplifies this imbalance. To finetune the text embedding, we propose a collaborative distance-constrained debiasing strategy that balances embedding distances to improve fairness without auxiliary references. However, mitigating bias can compromise the original generation quality. To address this, we introduce a two-stage text-guided sampling strategy to limit when the debiased text encoder intervenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LightFair is effective and efficient. Notably, on Stable Diffusion v1.5, our method achieves SOTA debiasing at just $1/4$ of the training burden, with virtually no increase in sampling burden.

Existing human-scene interaction datasets suffer from insufficient interaction categories and typically only consider interactions with static objects (do not change object positions), and the collection of such datasets with movable objects is difficult and costly. To address this problem, we construct the InteractMove dataset for Movable Human-Object Interaction in 3D Scenes by aligning existing human object interaction data with scene contexts, featuring three key characteristics: 1) scenes containing multiple movable objects with text-controlled interaction specifications (including same-category distractors requiring spatial and 3D scene context understanding), 2) diverse object types and sizes with varied interaction patterns (one-hand, two-hand, etc.), and 3) physically plausible object manipulation trajectories. With the introduction of various movable objects, this task becomes more challenging, as the model needs to identify objects to be interacted with accurately, learn to interact with objects of different sizes and categories, and avoid collisions between movable objects and the scene. To tackle such challenges, we propose a novel pipeline solution. We first use 3D visual grounding models to identify the interaction object. Then, we propose a hand-object joint affordance learning to predict contact regions for different hand joints and object parts, enabling accurate grasping and manipulation of diverse objects. Finally, we optimize interactions with local-scene modeling and collision avoidance constraints, ensuring physically plausible motions and avoiding collisions between objects and the scene.

        "summary": "While diffusion models have set a new benchmark for quality in Low-Dose Computed Tomography (LDCT) denoising, their clinical adoption is critically hindered by extreme computational costs, with inference times often exceeding thousands of seconds per scan. To overcome this barrier, we introduce MAN, a Latent Diffusion Enhanced Multistage Anti-Noise Network for Efficient and High-Quality Low-Dose CT Image Denoising task. Our method operates in a compressed latent space via a perceptually-optimized autoencoder, enabling an attention-based conditional U-Net to perform the fast, deterministic conditional denoising diffusion process with drastically reduced overhead. On the LDCT and Projection dataset, our model achieves superior perceptual quality, surpassing CNN/GAN-based methods while rivaling the reconstruction fidelity of computationally heavy diffusion models like DDPM and Dn-Dp. Most critically, in the inference stage, our model is over 60x faster than representative pixel space diffusion denoisers, while remaining competitive on PSNR/SSIM scores. By bridging the gap between high fidelity and clinical viability, our work demonstrates a practical path forward for advanced generative models in medical imaging.",

Existing methods often tie the structure to the number of classes and underutilize the rich prototype information available at intermediate hierarchical levels. We introduce deep taxonomic networks, a novel deep latent variable approach designed to bridge these gaps. Our method optimizes a large latent taxonomic hierarchy, specifically a complete binary tree structured mixture-of-Gaussian prior within a variational inference framework, to automatically discover taxonomic structures and associated prototype clusters directly from unlabeled data without assuming true label sizes. We analytically show that optimizing the ELBO of our method encourages the discovery of hierarchical relationships among prototypes. Empirically, our learned models demonstrate strong hierarchical clustering performance, outperforming baselines across diverse image classification datasets using our novel evaluation mechanism that leverages prototype clusters discovered at all hierarchical levels. Qualitative results further reveal that deep taxonomic networks discover rich and interpretable hierarchical taxonomies, capturing both coarse-grained semantic categories and fine-grained visual distinctions.",

Conventional Mamba architectures rely on predetermined paths that cannot adapt to diverse degradations, constraining both restoration performance and computational efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we propose VAMamba, a Visual Adaptive Mamba framework with two key innovations. First, QCLAM(Queue-basedCacheLow-rankAdaptiveMemory)enhancesfeaturelearningthrougha FIFO cache that stores historical representations. Similarity between current LoRA-adapted and cached features guides intelligent fusion, enabling dynamic reuse while effectively controlling memorygrowth.Second, GPS-SS2D(GreedyPathScanSS2D)introducesadaptive scanning. A Vision Transformer generates score maps to estimate pixel importance, and a greedy strategy de termines optimal forward and backward scanning paths. These learned trajectories replace rigid patterns, enabling SS2D to perform targeted feature extraction. The integration of QCLAM and GPS-SS2D allows VAMamba to adaptively focus on degraded regions while maintaining high computational efficiency. Extensive experiments across diverse restoration tasks demonstrate that VAMamba consistently outperforms existing approaches in both restoration quality and efficiency, establishing new benchmarks for adaptive image restoration.

Existing works revolve around simulated images, but the large amount of irrelevant information embedded in the images, such as background, noise, etc., seriously affects the quality of the migrated information. Our work explores a new simulated data to migrate purer and key target knowledge, i.e., forward scattering center model (FSCM) which models the actual local structure of the target with strong physical meaning and interpretability. To achieve this purpose, multi-level heterogeneous knowledge transfer (MHKT) network is proposed, which fully migrates FSCM knowledge from the feature, distribution and category levels, respectively. Specifically, we permit the more suitable feature representations for the heterogeneous data and separate non-informative knowledge by task-associated information selector (TAIS), to complete purer target feature migration. In the distribution alignment, the new metric function maximum discrimination divergence (MDD) in target generic knowledge transfer (TGKT) module perceives transferable knowledge efficiently while preserving discriminative structure about classes. Moreover, category relation knowledge transfer (CRKT) module leverages the category relation consistency constraint to break the dilemma of optimization bias towards simulation data due to imbalance between simulated and measured data. Such stepwise knowledge selection and migration will ensure the integrity of the migrated FSCM knowledge. Notably, extensive experiments on two new datasets formed by FSCM data and measured SAR images demonstrate the superior performance of our method.",

Despite substantial progress in the field, current methods that primarily rely on video super-resolution and generative frameworks continue to face three fundamental challenges: (1) faithfully modeling intricate facial textures while preserving temporal consistency; (2) restricted model generalization due to the lack of high-quality face video training data; and (3) low efficiency caused by repeated denoising steps during inference. To address these challenges, we propose VividFace, a novel and efficient one-step diffusion framework for video face enhancement. Built upon the pretrained WANX video generation model, our method leverages powerful spatiotemporal priors through a single-step flow matching paradigm, enabling direct mapping from degraded inputs to high-quality outputs with significantly reduced inference time. To further boost efficiency, we propose a Joint Latent-Pixel Face-Focused Training strategy that employs stochastic switching between facial region optimization and global reconstruction, providing explicit supervision in both latent and pixel spaces through a progressive two-stage training process. Additionally, we introduce an MLLM-driven data curation pipeline for automated selection of high-quality video face datasets, enhancing model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that VividFace achieves state-of-the-art results in perceptual quality, identity preservation, and temporal stability, while offering practical resources for the research community.",

        "summary": "Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have recently emerged as a powerful backbone for image generation, demonstrating superior scalability and performance over U-Net architectures. However, their practical deployment is hindered by substantial computational and memory costs. While Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has shown promise for U-Nets, its application to DiTs faces unique challenges, primarily due to the sensitivity and distributional complexity of activations. In this work, we identify activation quantization as the primary bottleneck for pushing DiTs to extremely low-bit settings. To address this, we propose a systematic QAT framework for DiTs, named RobuQ. We start by establishing a strong ternary weight (W1.58A4) DiT baseline. Building upon this, we propose RobustQuantizer to achieve robust activation quantization. Our theoretical analyses show that the Hadamard transform can convert unknown per-token distributions into per-token normal distributions, providing a strong foundation for this method. Furthermore, we propose AMPN, the first Activation-only Mixed-Precision Network pipeline for DiTs. This method applies ternary weights across the entire network while allocating different activation precisions to each layer to eliminate information bottlenecks. Through extensive experiments on unconditional and conditional image generation, our RobuQ framework achieves state-of-the-art performance for DiT quantization in sub-4-bit quantization configuration. To the best of our knowledge, RobuQ is the first achieving stable and competitive image generation on large datasets like ImageNet-1K with activations quantized to average 2 bits.

In this work, we propose NeuroAdapter, a visual decoding framework that directly conditions a latent diffusion model on brain representations, bypassing the need for intermediate feature spaces. Our method demonstrates competitive visual reconstruction quality on public fMRI datasets compared to prior work, while providing greater transparency into how brain signals shape the generation process. To this end, we contribute an Image-Brain BI-directional interpretability framework (IBBI) which investigates cross-attention mechanisms across diffusion denoising steps to reveal how different cortical areas influence the unfolding generative trajectory. Our results highlight the potential of end-to-end brain-to-image decoding and establish a path toward interpreting diffusion models through the lens of visual neuroscience.",

Pancreatic diseases exhibit marked regional heterogeneity cancers predominantly occur in the head region while chronic pancreatitis causes tissue loss in the tail, making accurate segmentation of the organ into head, body, and tail regions essential for precise diagnosis and treatment planning. This segmentation task remains exceptionally challenging in MRI due to variable morphology, poor soft-tissue contrast, and anatomical variations across patients. Our novel contribution tackles two fundamental challenges: first, the technical complexity of pancreas part delineation in MRI, and second the data scarcity problem that has hindered prior approaches. We introduce a privacy-preserving FL framework that enables collaborative model training across seven medical institutions without direct data sharing, leveraging a diverse dataset of 711 T1W and 726 T2W MRI scans. Our key innovations include: (1) a systematic evaluation of three state-of-the-art segmentation architectures (U-Net, Attention U-Net,Swin UNETR) paired with two FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx), revealing Attention U-Net with FedAvg as optimal for pancreatic heterogeneity, which was never been done before; (2) a novel anatomically-informed loss function prioritizing region-specific texture contrasts in MRI.

This survey examines how 3DGS is being adopted across SLAM, telepresence and teleoperation, robotic manipulation, and 3D content generation. Despite their differences, these domains share common goals: photorealistic rendering, meaningful 3D structure, and accurate downstream tasks. We organize the review around unified research questions that explain why 3DGS is increasingly displacing NeRF-based approaches: What technical advantages drive its adoption? How does it adapt to different input modalities and domain-specific constraints? What limitations remain? By systematically comparing domain-specific pipelines, we show that 3DGS balances photorealism, geometric fidelity, and computational efficiency. The survey offers a roadmap for leveraging neural rendering not only for image synthesis but also for perception, interaction, and content creation across real and virtual environments.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we propose a training scheme called OVSeg3R to learn open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation from well-studied 2D perception models with the aid of 3D reconstruction. OVSeg3R directly adopts reconstructed scenes from 2D videos as input, avoiding costly manual adjustment while aligning input with real-world applications. By exploiting the 2D to 3D correspondences provided by 3D reconstruction models, OVSeg3R projects each view's 2D instance mask predictions, obtained from an open-vocabulary 2D model, onto 3D to generate annotations for the view's corresponding sub-scene. To avoid incorrectly introduced false positives as supervision due to partial annotations from 2D to 3D, we propose a View-wise Instance Partition algorithm, which partitions predictions to their respective views for supervision, stabilizing the training process. Furthermore, since 3D reconstruction models tend to over-smooth geometric details, clustering reconstructed points into representative super-points based solely on geometry, as commonly done in mainstream 3D segmentation methods, may overlook geometrically non-salient objects. We therefore introduce 2D Instance Boundary-aware Superpoint, which leverages 2D masks to constrain the superpoint clustering, preventing superpoints from violating instance boundaries. With these designs, OVSeg3R not only extends a state-of-the-art closed-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation model to open-vocabulary, but also substantially narrows the performance gap between tail and head classes, ultimately leading to an overall improvement of +2.3 mAP on the ScanNet200 benchmark. Furthermore, under the standard open-vocabulary setting, OVSeg3R surpasses previous methods by about +7.1 mAP on the novel classes, further validating its effectiveness.",

In this work, we propose a novel framework that improves segmentation accuracy and efficiency by integrating a Dynamic Kernel (DK) mechanism with a global Encoder Attention module. The DK mechanism, initialized by a global context vector from the EA module, iteratively refines segmentation predictions across decoding stages, enabling the model to focus on and accurately delineate complex polyp boundaries. The EA module enhances the network's ability to capture critical lesion features by aggregating multi scale information from all encoder layers. In addition, we employ Unified Channel Adaptation (UCA) in the decoder to standardize feature dimensions across stages, ensuring consistent and computationally efficient information fusion. Our approach extends the lesion-aware kernel framework by introducing a more flexible, attention driven kernel initialization and a unified decoder design. Extensive experiments on the KvasirSEG and CVC ClinicDB benchmark datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms several state of the art segmentation methods, achieving superior Dice and Intersection over Union scores. Moreover, UCA simplifies the decoder structure, reducing computational cost without compromising accuracy. Overall, the proposed method provides a robust and adaptable solution for polyp segmentation, with promising applications in clinical and automated diagnostic systems.",

OriGS addresses this by introducing a hyperdimensional representation grounded in scene orientation. We first estimate a Global Orientation Field that propagates principal forward directions across space and time, serving as stable structural guidance for dynamic modeling. Built upon this, we propose Orientation-aware Hyper-Gaussian, a unified formulation that embeds time, space, geometry, and orientation into a coherent probabilistic state.

Knowledge distillation transfers teacher knowledge to students, but existing static feature matching methods cannot capture how modern transformer architectures dynamically generate features. We propose 'RestoRect', a novel Latent Rectified Flow Feature Distillation method for restoring degraded images. We apply rectified flow to reformulate feature distillation as a generative process where students learn to synthesize teacher-quality features through learnable trajectories in latent space. Our framework combines Retinex theory for physics-based decomposition with learnable anisotropic diffusion constraints, and trigonometric color space polarization. We introduce a Feature Layer Extraction loss for robust knowledge transfer between different network architectures through cross-normalized transformer feature alignment with percentile-based outlier detection. RestoRect achieves better training stability, and faster convergence and inference while preserving restoration quality. We demonstrate superior results across 15 image restoration datasets, covering 4 tasks, on 8 metrics.",

However, pre-adapted multi-modal FAS models often fail to detect unseen attacks from new target domains. Although a more realistic domain adaptation (DA) scenario has been proposed for single-modal FAS to learn specific spoof attacks during inference, DA remains unexplored in multi-modal FAS methods. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, MFAS-DANet, to address three major challenges in multi-modal FAS under the DA scenario: missing modalities, noisy pseudo labels, and model degradation. First, to tackle the issue of missing modalities, we propose extracting complementary features from other modalities to substitute missing modality features or enhance existing ones. Next, to reduce the impact of noisy pseudo labels during model adaptation, we propose deriving reliable pseudo labels by leveraging prediction uncertainty across different modalities. Finally, to prevent model degradation, we design an adaptive mechanism that decreases the loss weight during unstable adaptations and increasing it during stable ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and state-of-the-art performance of our proposed MFAS-DANet.",

Test-time optimization has emerged as a promising approach to address this limitation by refining generation without the need for retraining. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained test-time optimization framework that enhances compositional faithfulness in T2I generation. Unlike most of prior approaches that rely solely on a global image/text similarity score, our method decomposes the input prompt into semantic concepts and evaluates alignment at both the global and concept levels. A fine-grained variant of CLIP is used to compute concept-level correspondence, producing detailed feedback on missing or inaccurate concepts. This feedback is fed into an iterative prompt refinement loop, enabling the large language model to propose improved prompts. Experiments on DrawBench and CompBench prompts demonstrate that our method significantly improves concept coverage and human-judged faithfulness over both standard test-time optimization and the base T2I model.

We present 3DPCNet, a compact, estimator-agnostic module that operates directly on 3D joint coordinates to rectify any input pose into a consistent, body-centered canonical frame. Its hybrid encoder fuses local skeletal features from a graph convolutional network with global context from a transformer via a gated cross-attention mechanism. From this representation, the model predicts a continuous 6D rotation that is mapped to an $SO(3)$ matrix to align the pose. We train the model in a self-supervised manner on the MM-Fi dataset using synthetically rotated poses, guided by a composite loss ensuring both accurate rotation and pose reconstruction. On the MM-Fi benchmark, 3DPCNet reduces the mean rotation error from over 20$^{\\circ}$ to 3.4$^{\\circ}$ and the Mean Per Joint Position Error from ~64 mm to 47 mm compared to a geometric baseline. Qualitative evaluations on the TotalCapture dataset further demonstrate that our method produces acceleration signals from video that show strong visual correspondence to ground-truth IMU sensor data, confirming that our module removes viewpoint variability to enable physically plausible motion analysis.",

Despite its relevance, existing self-contact datasets lack the variety of self-contact poses and precise body shapes, limiting conclusive analysis between self-contact poses and shapes. To address this, we begin by introducing the first extensive self-contact dataset with precise body shape registration, Goliath-SC, consisting of 383K self-contact poses across 130 subjects. Using this dataset, we propose generative modeling of self-contact prior conditioned by body shape parameters, based on a body-part-wise latent diffusion with self-attention. We further incorporate this prior into single-view human pose estimation while refining estimated poses to be in contact. Our experiments suggest that shape conditioning is vital to the successful modeling of self-contact pose distribution, hence improving single-view pose estimation in self-contact.",

UniPose transfers 2D HPE annotations from large-scale RGB datasets (e.g., MS COCO) to the 3D domain via self-supervised learning on easily acquired RGB-D sequences, eliminating the need for labor-intensive 3D keypoint annotations. This approach bridges the gap between 2D and 3D domains without suffering from issues related to multi-view camera calibration or synthetic-to-real data shifts. During training, UniPose leverages off-the-shelf 2D pose estimations as weak supervision for point cloud networks, incorporating spatial-temporal constraints like body symmetry and joint motion. The 2D-to-3D back-projection loss and cross-modality interaction further enhance this process. By treating the point cloud network's 3D HPE results as pseudo ground truth, our anchor-to-joint prediction method performs 3D lifting on RGB and depth networks, making it more robust against inaccuracies in 2D HPE results compared to state-of-the-art methods. Experiments on CMU Panoptic and ITOP datasets show that UniPose achieves comparable performance to fully supervised methods. Incorporating large-scale unlabeled data (e.g., NTU RGB+D 60) enhances its performance under challenging conditions, demonstrating its potential for practical applications.

To address this, we introduce CasPoinTr, a novel point cloud completion framework using cascaded networks and knowledge distillation. CasPoinTr decomposes the completion task into two synergistic stages: Shape Reconstruction, which generates auxiliary information, and Fused Completion, which leverages this information alongside knowledge distillation to generate the final output. Through knowledge distillation, a teacher model trained on denser point clouds transfers incomplete-complete associative knowledge to the student model, enhancing its ability to estimate the overall shape and predict missing regions. Together, the cascaded networks and knowledge distillation enhance the model's ability to capture global shape context while refining local details, effectively bridging the gap between incomplete inputs and complete targets. Experiments on ShapeNet-55 under different difficulty settings demonstrate that CasPoinTr outperforms existing methods in shape recovery and detail preservation, highlighting the effectiveness of our cascaded structure and distillation strategy.",

        "summary": "The CLIP model has become a cornerstone of large-scale retrieval systems by aligning text and image data in a unified embedding space. Despite its simplicity and efficiency, CLIP struggles when applied to tasks whose input distributions diverge from its training corpus, such as queries with multilingual, long-form, or multimodal differences. To avoid costly retraining, existing methods mainly adopt query-rewriting strategies with large language models (LLMs), aiming to mitigate distribution gaps at the query level. However, due to the lack of supervision signals, LLMs fail to generate the optimal one that fits the training distribution. We address this challenge with GRAPE (Grouped Ranking-Aware Policy Optimization Enhancement), a plug-and-play enhancement approach that incorporates ranking signals into retrieval-guided query rewriting with LLMs. Intuitively, GRAPE proposes to leverage GRPO to bridge distributional differences -- including length, multilingual, and modality shifts -- by transforming queries into forms better aligned with the retriever's training distribution. However, our preliminary experiment finds that naively finetuning LLM with similarity scores can lead to score inflation, where nearly all candidates are assigned unexpectedly high scores regardless of their true relevance. To address score inflation, we propose a corpus-relative ranking-based reward, which explicitly aligns optimization with ranking metrics while suppressing spurious score inflation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRAPE consistently improves retrieval performance under distributional shifts -- including multilingual differences (Flickr30k-CN, CVLUE, XM3600), length differences (Wikipedia), and multimodal differences (CIRR) -- achieving an average improvement of 4.9\\% in Recall\\@10.

Instead, we propose a test-time uncertainty estimation framework that is compatible with any pretrained networks. Our framework is grounded in the transformation equivariance property of registration, which states that the true mapping between two images should remain consistent under spatial perturbations of the input. By analyzing the variance of network predictions under such perturbations, we derive a theoretical decomposition of perturbation-based uncertainty in registration. This decomposition separates into two terms: (i) an intrinsic spread, reflecting epistemic noise, and (ii) a bias jitter, capturing how systematic error drifts under perturbations. Across four anatomical structures (brain, cardiac, abdominal, and lung) and multiple registration models (uniGradICON, SynthMorph), the uncertainty maps correlate consistently with registration errors and highlight regions requiring caution. Our framework turns any pretrained registration network into a risk-aware tool at test time, placing medical image registration one step closer to safe deployment in clinical and large-scale research settings.",

        "summary": "The integration of Reinforcement Learning (RL) into flow matching models for text-to-image (T2I) generation has driven substantial advances in generation quality. However, these gains often come at the cost of exhaustive exploration and inefficient sampling strategies due to slight variation in the sampling group. Building on this insight, we propose Dynamic-TreeRPO, which implements the sliding-window sampling strategy as a tree-structured search with dynamic noise intensities along depth. We perform GRPO-guided optimization and constrained Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) sampling within this tree structure. By sharing prefix paths of the tree, our design effectively amortizes the computational overhead of trajectory search. With well-designed noise intensities for each tree layer, Dynamic-TreeRPO can enhance the variation of exploration without any extra computational cost. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and RL paradigm within Dynamic-TreeRPO to construct our proposed LayerTuning-RL, reformulating the loss function of SFT as a dynamically weighted Progress Reward Model (PRM) rather than a separate pretraining method. By associating this weighted PRM with dynamic-adaptive clipping bounds, the disruption of exploration process in Dynamic-TreeRPO is avoided. Benefiting from the tree-structured sampling and the LayerTuning-RL paradigm, our model dynamically explores a diverse search space along effective directions. Compared to existing baselines, our approach demonstrates significant superiority in terms of semantic consistency, visual fidelity, and human preference alignment on established benchmarks, including HPS-v2.1, PickScore, and ImageReward. In particular, our model outperforms SoTA by $4.9\\%$, $5.91\\%$, and $8.66\\%$ on those benchmarks, respectively, while improving the training efficiency by nearly $50\\%$.",

In a clinical study involving 25 dentists, evaluating 1,946 patients and encompassing 3,105 QA pairs, DentVLM surpassed the diagnostic performance of 13 junior dentists on 21 of 36 tasks and exceeded that of 12 senior dentists on 12 of 36 tasks. When integrated into a collaborative workflow, DentVLM elevated junior dentists' performance to senior levels and reduced diagnostic time for all practitioners by 15-22%. Furthermore, DentVLM exhibited promising performance across three practical utility scenarios, including home-based dental health management, hospital-based intelligent diagnosis and multi-agent collaborative interaction. These findings establish DentVLM as a robust clinical decision support tool, poised to enhance primary dental care, mitigate provider-patient imbalances, and democratize access to specialized medical expertise within the field of dentistry.",

To tackle these challenges, we propose a Likelihood-Regularized Policy Optimization (LRPO) framework, the first to apply online reinforcement learning (RL) to the BFR task. LRPO leverages rewards from sampled candidates to refine the policy network, increasing the likelihood of high-quality outputs while improving restoration performance on low-quality inputs. However, directly applying RL to BFR creates incompatibility issues, producing restoration results that deviate significantly from the ground truth. To balance perceptual quality and fidelity, we propose three key strategies: 1) a composite reward function tailored for face restoration assessment, 2) ground-truth guided likelihood regularization, and 3) noise-level advantage assignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed LRPO significantly improves the face restoration quality over baseline methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

We propose Dual-Decoupled Prompting (DDP), a replay-free and parameter-efficient framework that explicitly addresses both issues. DDP assigns class-specific positive-negative prompts to disentangle semantics and introduces Progressive Confidence Decoupling (PCD), a curriculum-inspired decoupling strategy that suppresses false positives. Past prompts are frozen as knowledge anchors, and interlayer prompting enhances efficiency. On MS-COCO and PASCAL VOC, DDP consistently outperforms prior methods and is the first replay-free MLCIL approach to exceed 80% mAP and 70% F1 under the standard MS-COCO B40-C10 benchmark.",

Inspired by these breakthroughs, researchers have extended these paradigms to Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). However, a critical limitation emerges: as their reasoning chains extend, LMMs increasingly rely on textual logic, progressively losing grounding in the underlying visual information. This leads to reasoning paths that diverge from the image content, culminating in erroneous conclusions. To address this, we introduce a strikingly simple yet effective training-free visual-reasoning pipeline. The core concept is to decouple the reasoning and perception processes. A powerful LLM orchestrates the high-level reasoning, strategically interrogating a LMM to extract specific visual information required for its logical chain. The LMM, in turn, functions exclusively as a visual question-answering engine, supplying the necessary perceptual details on demand. This lightweight, plug-and-play approach requires no additional training or architectural changes. Comprehensive evaluations validate that our framework effectively governs the visual reasoning process, leading to a significant reduction in visually-unfounded reasoning steps and a substantial improvement in reasoning fidelity.",

        "summary": "Remote sensing pansharpening aims to reconstruct spatial-spectral properties during the fusion of panchromatic (PAN) images and low-resolution multi-spectral (LR-MS) images, finally generating the high-resolution multi-spectral (HR-MS) images. Although deep learning-based models have achieved excellent performance, they often come with high computational complexity, which hinder their applications on resource-limited devices. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of applying the binary neural network (BNN) to pan-sharpening. Nevertheless, there are two main issues with binarizing pan-sharpening models: (i) the binarization will cause serious spectral distortion due to the inconsistent spectral distribution of the PAN/LR-MS images; (ii) the common binary convolution kernel is difficult to adapt to the multi-scale and anisotropic spatial features of remote sensing objects, resulting in serious degradation of contours. To address the above issues, we design the customized spatial-spectral binarized convolution (S2B-Conv), which is composed of the Spectral-Redistribution Mechanism (SRM) and Gabor Spatial Feature Amplifier (GSFA). Specifically, SRM employs an affine transformation, generating its scaling and bias parameters through a dynamic learning process. GSFA, which randomly selects different frequencies and angles within a preset range, enables to better handle multi-scale and-directional spatial features. A series of S2B-Conv form a brand-new binary network for pan-sharpening, dubbed as S2BNet. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments have shown our high-efficiency binarized pan-sharpening method can attain a promising performance.",

        "summary": "Object detection has advanced significantly in the closed-set setting, but real-world deployment remains limited by two challenges: poor generalization to unseen categories and insufficient robustness under adverse conditions. Prior research has explored these issues separately: visible-infrared detection improves robustness but lacks generalization, while open-world detection leverages vision-language alignment strategy for category diversity but struggles under extreme environments. This trade-off leaves robustness and diversity difficult to achieve simultaneously. To mitigate these issues, we propose \\textbf{C3-OWD}, a curriculum cross-modal contrastive learning framework that unifies both strengths. Stage~1 enhances robustness by pretraining with RGBT data, while Stage~2 improves generalization via vision-language alignment. To prevent catastrophic forgetting between two stages, we introduce an Exponential Moving Average (EMA) mechanism that theoretically guarantees preservation of pre-stage performance with bounded parameter lag and function consistency. Experiments on FLIR, OV-COCO, and OV-LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach: C3-OWD achieves $80.1$ AP$^{50}$ on FLIR, $48.6$ AP$^{50}_{\\text{Novel}}$ on OV-COCO, and $35.7$ mAP$_r$ on OV-LVIS, establishing competitive performance across both robustness and diversity evaluations.

        "summary": "Deep learning-based techniques for the analysis of multimodal remote sensing data have become popular due to their ability to effectively integrate complementary spatial, spectral, and structural information from different sensors. Recently, denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) have attracted attention in the remote sensing community due to their powerful ability to capture robust and complex spatial-spectral distributions. However, pre-training multimodal DDPMs may result in modality imbalance, and effectively leveraging diffusion features to guide complementary diversity feature extraction remains an open question. To address these issues, this paper proposes a balanced diffusion-guided fusion (BDGF) framework that leverages multimodal diffusion features to guide a multi-branch network for land-cover classification. Specifically, we propose an adaptive modality masking strategy to encourage the DDPMs to obtain a modality-balanced rather than spectral image-dominated data distribution. Subsequently, these diffusion features hierarchically guide feature extraction among CNN, Mamba, and transformer networks by integrating feature fusion, group channel attention, and cross-attention mechanisms. Finally, a mutual learning strategy is developed to enhance inter-branch collaboration by aligning the probability entropy and feature similarity of individual subnetworks. Extensive experiments on four multimodal remote sensing datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior classification performance.

        "summary": "Spike camera, a type of neuromorphic sensor with high-temporal resolution, shows great promise for high-speed visual tasks. Unlike traditional cameras, spike camera continuously accumulates photons and fires asynchronous spike streams. Due to unique data modality, spike streams require reconstruction methods to become perceptible to the human eye. However, lots of methods struggle to handle spike streams in low-light high-speed scenarios due to severe noise and sparse information. In this work, we propose Diff-SPK, the first diffusion-based reconstruction method for spike camera. Diff-SPK effectively leverages generative priors to supplement texture information in low-light conditions. Specifically, it first employs an \\textbf{E}nhanced \\textbf{T}exture \\textbf{f}rom Inter-spike \\textbf{I}nterval (ETFI) to aggregate sparse information from low-light spike streams. Then, ETFI serves as a conditioning input for ControlNet to generate the high-speed scenes. To improve the quality of results, we introduce an ETFI-based feature fusion module during the generation process. Moreover, we establish the first bona fide benchmark for the low-light spike stream reconstruction task. It significantly surpasses existing reconstruction datasets in scale and provides quantitative illumination information. The performance on real low-light spike streams demonstrates the superiority of Diff-SPK.",

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of generative AI has enabled the mass production of photorealistic synthetic images, blurring the boundary between authentic and fabricated visual content. This challenge is particularly evident in deepfake scenarios involving facial manipulation, but also extends to broader AI-generated content (AIGC) cases involving fully synthesized scenes. As such content becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish from reality, the integrity of visual media is under threat. To address this issue, we propose a physically interpretable deepfake detection framework and demonstrate that defocus blur can serve as an effective forensic signal. Defocus blur is a depth-dependent optical phenomenon that naturally occurs in camera-captured images due to lens focus and scene geometry. In contrast, synthetic images often lack realistic depth-of-field (DoF) characteristics. To capture these discrepancies, we construct a defocus blur map and use it as a discriminative feature for detecting manipulated content. Unlike RGB textures or frequency-domain signals, defocus blur arises universally from optical imaging principles and encodes physical scene structure. This makes it a robust and generalizable forensic cue. Our approach is supported by three in-depth feature analyses, and experimental results confirm that defocus blur provides a reliable and interpretable cue for identifying synthetic images. We aim for our defocus-based detection pipeline and interpretability tools to contribute meaningfully to ongoing research in media forensics.

We propose OracleGS, a novel framework that reconciles generative completeness with regressive fidelity for sparse view Gaussian Splatting. Instead of using generative models to patch incomplete reconstructions, our \"propose-and-validate\" framework first leverages a pre-trained 3D-aware diffusion model to synthesize novel views to propose a complete scene. We then repurpose a multi-view stereo (MVS) model as a 3D-aware oracle to validate the 3D uncertainties of generated views, using its attention maps to reveal regions where the generated views are well-supported by multi-view evidence versus where they fall into regions of high uncertainty due to occlusion, lack of texture, or direct inconsistency. This uncertainty signal directly guides the optimization of a 3D Gaussian Splatting model via an uncertainty-weighted loss. Our approach conditions the powerful generative prior on multi-view geometric evidence, filtering hallucinatory artifacts while preserving plausible completions in under-constrained regions, outperforming state-of-the-art methods on datasets including Mip-NeRF 360 and NeRF Synthetic.",

        "summary": "Vision-language models often hallucinate details, generating non-existent objects or inaccurate attributes that compromise output reliability. Existing methods typically address these issues via extensive human annotations or external supervision from more powerful models. In this work, we present a novel framework that leverages the model's self-consistency between long responses and short answers to generate preference pairs for training. We observe that short binary questions tend to yield highly reliable responses, which can be used to query the target model to evaluate and rank its generated responses. Specifically, we design a self-reflection pipeline where detailed model responses are compared against concise binary answers, and inconsistency signals are utilized to automatically curate high-quality training data without human annotations or external model-based supervision. By relying solely on self-consistency rather than external supervision, our method offers a scalable and efficient solution that effectively reduces hallucinations using unlabeled data. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks, i.e., AMBER, MultiObject-Hal (ROPE), Object HalBench, and MMHal-Bench, demonstrate significant improvements in factual grounding and reliability. Moreover, our approach maintains robust instruction-following ability, as evidenced by enhanced performance on LLaVA-Bench and MMBench.",

        "summary": "Model inversion is a widely adopted technique in data-free learning that reconstructs synthetic inputs from a pretrained model through iterative optimization, without access to original training data. Unfortunately, its application to state-of-the-art Vision Transformers (ViTs) poses a major computational challenge, due to their expensive self-attention mechanisms. To address this, Sparse Model Inversion (SMI) was proposed to improve efficiency by pruning and discarding seemingly unimportant patches, which were even claimed to be obstacles to knowledge transfer. However, our empirical findings suggest the opposite: even randomly selected patches can eventually acquire transferable knowledge through continued inversion. This reveals that discarding any prematurely inverted patches is inefficient, as it suppresses the extraction of class-agnostic features essential for knowledge transfer, along with class-specific features. In this paper, we propose Patch Rebirth Inversion (PRI), a novel approach that incrementally detaches the most important patches during the inversion process to construct sparse synthetic images, while allowing the remaining patches to continue evolving for future selection. This progressive strategy not only improves efficiency, but also encourages initially less informative patches to gradually accumulate more class-relevant knowledge, a phenomenon we refer to as the Re-Birth effect, thereby effectively balancing class-agnostic and class-specific knowledge. Experimental results show that PRI achieves up to 10x faster inversion than standard Dense Model Inversion (DMI) and 2x faster than SMI, while consistently outperforming SMI in accuracy and matching the performance of DMI.",

The patch is optimized by successively adding Gaussian blobs, guided only by the cosine similarity scores from a surrogate FR model to maximally degrade identity recognition. We demonstrate that with approximately 10,000 queries to a black-box ArcFace model, the resulting GaP achieves a high attack success rate in both digital and real-world physical tests. Critically, the attack shows strong transferability, successfully deceiving an entirely unseen FaceNet model.

To overcome these limitations, we introduce Earth-Agent, the first agentic framework that unifies RGB and spectral EO data within an MCP-based tool ecosystem, enabling cross-modal, multi-step, and quantitative spatiotemporal reasoning beyond pretrained MLLMs. Earth-Agent supports complex scientific tasks such as geophysical parameter retrieval and quantitative spatiotemporal analysis by dynamically invoking expert tools and models across modalities. To support comprehensive evaluation, we further propose Earth-Bench, a benchmark of 248 expert-curated tasks with 13,729 images, spanning spectrum, products and RGB modalities, and equipped with a dual-level evaluation protocol that assesses both reasoning trajectories and final outcomes. We conduct comprehensive experiments varying different LLM backbones, comparisons with general agent frameworks, and comparisons with MLLMs on remote sensing benchmarks, demonstrating both the effectiveness and potential of Earth-Agent.

Although cascade models can mitigate computational cost, stage-wise separation prevents effective end-to-end optimization, hampers knowledge sharing, and often results in inaccurate distribution learning within each stage.

The introduced vision-guided module is a dual-branch architecture that synergistically combines fine-grained spatial feature extraction with high-level semantic summarization. These enriched representations further serve as the auxiliary prompts to guide large vision-language models (VLMs) (e.g., Qwen2.5-VL-7B) during instruction tuning, thereby facilitating the hierarchical cross-modal learning. We extensively conduct experiments across four tasks to demonstrate the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, on the change captioning task, our method outperforms the strongest method Semantic-CC by 1.39 points on the comprehensive S*m metric, which integrates the semantic similarity and descriptive accuracy to provide an overall evaluation of change caption.

        "summary": "Spatial grounding is crucial for referring image segmentation (RIS), where the goal of the task is to localize an object described by language. Current foundational vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, excel at aligning images and text but struggle with understanding spatial relationships. Within the language stream, most existing methods often focus on the primary noun phrase when extracting local text features, undermining contextual tokens. Within the vision stream, CLIP generates similar features for images with different spatial layouts, resulting in limited sensitivity to spatial structure. To address these limitations, we propose \\textsc{CoPatch}, a zero-shot RIS framework that leverages internal model components to enhance spatial representations in both text and image modalities. For language, \\textsc{CoPatch} constructs hybrid text features by incorporating context tokens carrying spatial cues. For vision, it extracts patch-level image features using our novel path discovered from intermediate layers, where spatial structure is better preserved. These enhanced features are fused into a clustered image-text similarity map, \\texttt{CoMap}, enabling precise mask selection. As a result, \\textsc{CoPatch} significantly improves spatial grounding in zero-shot RIS across RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and PhraseCut (+ 2--7 mIoU) without requiring any additional training. Our findings underscore the importance of recovering and leveraging the untapped spatial knowledge inherently embedded in VLMs, thereby paving the way for opportunities in zero-shot RIS.",

Here, we introduce XMAG, a lightweight FM developed through corss-magnification distillation that transfers knowledge from state-of-the-art 20x magnification teacher to an efficient 5x magnification student architecture. XMAG employs a compact backbone and operates entirely at 5x, requiring 11.3 times fewer patches per whole slide image (WSI) compared to existing approaches. Our Novel distillation framework incorporates dual-level knowledge transfer, aligning both global image representations and local spatial token mapping. We trained XMAG on 3.49 million images curated from publicly available datasets and evaluated performance across six clinically relevant histopathology analysis tasks spanning multiple cancer types. XMAG achieved diagnostic accuracy within 1% of substantially larger foundation models while delivering 30-fold processing acceleration, reaching 8.8 WSIs per minute processing speed. Our cross-institutional validation confirmed robust generalization. Further, we developed an end-to-end training strategy to further boost our model's performance to approach the larger FMs' performance. These results establish cross-magnification distillation as a viable approach for deploying FM capabilities in resource-constrained clinical environments, potentially enabling real-time pathology AI integration.",

Instead of introducing a novel method, we go back to basics and revisit fundamental problems in achieving such alignment. We leverage the prominent direct preference optimization approach for alignment training and employ public reward models to construct preference training datasets. Experiments are conducted across nine reward models, two benchmarks, and two baseline models with varying structures and generative algorithms. Our key findings are as follows: (1) Most reward models deliver valid reward scores for constructing preference data, even if some of them are not reliable evaluators. (2) Preference data demonstrates robust trends in both candidate scaling and sample scaling across models and benchmarks. (3) Observable biases in reward models, particularly in brightness, composition, and color scheme, render them susceptible to cause reward hacking. (4) A simple ensemble of these models yields robust and generalizable results by mitigating such biases. Built upon these observations, our alignment models significantly outperform prior models across standard metrics, GPT-4 assessments, and human evaluations, without any changes to model structures or the use of new datasets.

        "summary": "Aerial-view object detection is a critical technology for real-world applications such as natural resource monitoring, traffic management, and UAV-based search and rescue. Detecting tiny objects in high-resolution aerial imagery presents a long-standing challenge due to their limited visual cues and the difficulty of modeling global context in complex scenes. Existing methods are often hampered by delayed contextual fusion and inadequate non-linear modeling, failing to effectively use global information to refine shallow features and thus encountering a performance bottleneck. To address these challenges, we propose FMC-DETR, a novel framework with frequency-decoupled fusion for aerial-view object detection. First, we introduce the Wavelet Kolmogorov-Arnold Transformer (WeKat) backbone, which applies cascaded wavelet transforms to enhance global low-frequency context perception in shallow features while preserving fine-grained details, and employs Kolmogorov-Arnold networks to achieve adaptive non-linear modeling of multi-scale dependencies. Next, a lightweight Cross-stage Partial Fusion (CPF) module reduces redundancy and improves multi-scale feature interaction. Finally, we introduce the Multi-Domain Feature Coordination (MDFC) module, which unifies spatial, frequency, and structural priors to to balance detail preservation and global enhancement. Extensive experiments on benchmark aerial-view datasets demonstrate that FMC-DETR achieves state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters. On the challenging VisDrone dataset, our model achieves improvements of 6.5% AP and 8.2% AP50 over the baseline, highlighting its effectiveness in tiny object detection.

While self-supervised masked image modeling (MIM) offers a promising solution, existing approaches largely rely on random high-ratio masking, leading to inefficiency and poor semantic alignment. Moreover, region-aware variants typically depend on reconstruction heuristics or supervised signals, limiting their adaptability across tasks and modalities. We propose Mask What Matters, a controllable text-guided masking framework for self-supervised medical image analysis. By leveraging vision-language models for prompt-based region localization, our method flexibly applies differentiated masking to emphasize diagnostically relevant regions while reducing redundancy in background areas. This controllable design enables better semantic alignment, improved representation learning, and stronger cross-task generalizability. Comprehensive evaluation across multiple medical imaging modalities, including brain MRI, chest CT, and lung X-ray, shows that Mask What Matters consistently outperforms existing MIM methods (e.g., SparK), achieving gains of up to +3.1 percentage points in classification accuracy, +1.3 in box average precision (BoxAP), and +1.1 in mask average precision (MaskAP) for detection. Notably, it achieves these improvements with substantially lower overall masking ratios (e.g., 40\\% vs. 70\\%). This work demonstrates that controllable, text-driven masking can enable semantically aligned self-supervised learning, advancing the development of robust vision models for medical image analysis.",

        "summary": "Rehabilitation therapy for stroke patients faces a supply shortage despite the increasing demand. To address this issue, remote monitoring systems that reduce the burden on medical staff are emerging as a viable alternative. A key component of these remote monitoring systems is Human Action Recognition (HAR) technology, which classifies actions. However, existing HAR studies have primarily focused on non-disable individuals, making them unsuitable for recognizing the actions of stroke patients. HAR research for stroke has largely concentrated on classifying relatively simple actions using machine learning rather than deep learning. In this study, we designed a system to monitor the actions of stroke patients, focusing on domiciliary upper limb Activities of Daily Living (ADL). Our system utilizes IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) sensors and an RGB-D camera, which are the most common modalities in HAR. We directly collected a dataset through this system, investigated an appropriate preprocess and proposed a deep learning model suitable for processing multimodal data. We analyzed the collected dataset and found that the action data of stroke patients is less clustering than that of non-disabled individuals. Simultaneously, we found that the proposed model learns similar tendencies for each label in data with features that are difficult to clustering. This study suggests the possibility of expanding the deep learning model, which has learned the action features of stroke patients, to not only simple action recognition but also feedback such as assessment contributing to domiciliary rehabilitation in future research.

In this work, we present GeLoc3r, a novel approach to relative camera pose estimation that enhances pose regression methods through Geometric Consistency Regularization (GCR). GeLoc3r overcomes the speed-accuracy dilemma by training regression networks to produce geometrically consistent poses without inference-time geometric computation. During training, GeLoc3r leverages ground-truth depth to generate dense 3D-2D correspondences, weights them using a FusionTransformer that learns correspondence importance, and computes geometrically-consistent poses via weighted RANSAC. This creates a consistency loss that transfers geometric knowledge into the regression network. Unlike FAR method which requires both regression and geometric solving at inference, GeLoc3r only uses the enhanced regression head at test time, maintaining ReLoc3R's fast speed and approaching MASt3R's high accuracy. On challenging benchmarks, GeLoc3r consistently outperforms ReLoc3R, achieving significant improvements including 40.45% vs. 34.85% AUC@5{\\deg} on the CO3Dv2 dataset (16% relative improvement), 68.66% vs. 66.70% AUC@5{\\deg} on RealEstate10K, and 50.45% vs. 49.60% on MegaDepth1500. By teaching geometric consistency during training rather than enforcing it at inference, GeLoc3r represents a paradigm shift in how neural networks learn camera geometry, achieving both the speed of regression and the geometric understanding of correspondence methods.",

        "summary": "Floods are increasingly frequent natural disasters causing extensive human and economic damage, highlighting the critical need for rapid and accurate flood inundation mapping. While remote sensing technologies have advanced flood monitoring capabilities, operational challenges persist: single-sensor approaches face weather-dependent data availability and limited revisit periods, while multi-sensor fusion methods require substantial computational resources and large-scale labeled datasets. To address these limitations, this study introduces a novel sensor-flexible flood detection methodology by fine-tuning Presto, a lightweight ($\\sim$0.4M parameters) multi-modal pre-trained transformer that processes both Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and multispectral (MS) data at the pixel level. Our approach uniquely enables flood mapping using SAR-only, MS-only, or combined SAR+MS inputs through a single model architecture, addressing the critical operational need for rapid response with whatever sensor data becomes available first during disasters. We evaluated our method on the Sen1Floods11 dataset against the large-scale Prithvi-100M baseline ($\\sim$100M parameters) across three realistic data availability scenarios. The proposed model achieved superior performance with an F1 score of 0.896 and mIoU of 0.886 in the optimal sensor-fusion scenario, outperforming the established baseline. Crucially, the model demonstrated robustness by maintaining effective performance in MS-only scenarios (F1: 0.893) and functional capabilities in challenging SAR-only conditions (F1: 0.718), confirming the advantage of multi-modal pre-training for operational flood mapping. Our parameter-efficient, sensor-flexible approach offers an accessible and robust solution for real-world disaster scenarios requiring immediate flood extent assessment regardless of sensor availability constraints.",

The perceptual losses operate in a latent feature space defined by a pretrained encoder and aim to preserve semantic content by comparing high-level features rather than raw pixel values. However, the design of perceptual losses involves critical yet underexplored decisions, including the feature representation level, the dataset used to pretrain the encoder, and the relative importance assigned to the perceptual component during optimization. In this work, we introduce the concept of perceptual influence (a metric that quantifies the relative contribution of the perceptual loss term to the total loss) and propose a principled framework to assess the impact of the loss design choices on the model training performance. Through systematic experimentation, we show that the widely used configurations in the literature to set up a perceptual loss underperform compared to better-designed alternatives. Our findings show that better perceptual loss designs lead to significant improvements in noise reduction and structural fidelity of reconstructed CT images, without requiring any changes to the network architecture. We also provide objective guidelines, supported by statistical analysis, to inform the effective use of perceptual losses in LDCT denoising.

To operationalize this metric, we propose D-Plus-Minus (DPM), a novel post-hoc detection framework that identifies copyright infringement in text-to-image diffusion models. Specifically, DPM simulates inclusion and exclusion processes by fine-tuning models in two opposing directions: learning or unlearning. Besides, to disentangle concept-specific influence from the global parameter shifts induced by fine-tuning, DPM computes confidence scores over orthogonal prompt distributions using statistical metrics. Moreover, to facilitate standardized benchmarking, we also construct the Copyright Infringement Detection Dataset (CIDD), a comprehensive resource for evaluating detection across diverse categories. Our results demonstrate that DPM reliably detects infringement content without requiring access to the original training dataset or text prompts, offering an interpretable and practical solution for safeguarding intellectual property in the era of generative AI.",

Recently, a promising new direction has emerged with unified multimodal models (UMMs), which support both multimodal inputs and outputs. We believe such models have greater potential for decision-making by enabling reasoning through generated visual content. To this end, we propose Uni-Plan, a planning framework built on UMMs. Within this framework, a single model simultaneously serves as the policy, dynamics model, and value function. In addition, to avoid hallucinations in dynamics predictions, we present a novel approach self-discriminated filtering, where the generative model serves as a self-discriminator to filter out invalid dynamics predictions. Experiments on long-horizon planning tasks show that Uni-Plan substantially improves success rates compared to VLM-based methods, while also showing strong data scalability, requiring no expert demonstrations and achieving better performance under the same training-data size.

        "summary": "Due to scene complexity, sensor inaccuracies, and processing imprecision, point cloud corruption is inevitable. Over-reliance on input features is the root cause of DNN vulnerabilities. It remains unclear whether this issue exists in 3D tasks involving point clouds and whether reducing dependence on these features can enhance the model's robustness to corrupted point clouds. This study attempts to answer these questions. Specifically, we quantified the sensitivity of the DNN to point cloud features using Shapley values and found that models trained using traditional methods exhibited high sensitivity values for certain features. Furthermore, under an equal pruning ratio, prioritizing the pruning of highly sensitive features causes more severe damage to model performance than random pruning. We propose `Desensitized Adversarial Training' (DesenAT), generating adversarial samples using feature desensitization and conducting training within a self-distillation framework, which aims to alleviate DNN's over-reliance on point clouds features by smoothing sensitivity. First, data points with high contribution components are eliminated, and spatial transformation is used to simulate corruption scenes, generate adversarial samples, and conduct adversarial training on the model. Next, to compensate for information loss in adversarial samples, we use the self-distillation method to transfer knowledge from clean samples to adversarial samples, and perform adversarial training in a distillation manner.Extensive experiments on ModelNet-C and PointCloud-C demonstrate show that the propose method can effectively improve the robustness of the model without reducing the performance of clean data sets.

This limitation arises because diffusion models generate outputs in a non-causal manner, often leading to distortions or inconsistencies across views, and making it difficult to incrementally adapt accumulated knowledge to new queries. In contrast, autoregressive (AR) models operate in a causal fashion, generating each token based on all previously generated tokens. In this work, we introduce \\textbf{ARSS}, a novel framework that leverages a GPT-style decoder-only AR model to generate novel views from a single image, conditioned on a predefined camera trajectory. We employ a video tokenizer to map continuous image sequences into discrete tokens and propose a camera encoder that converts camera trajectories into 3D positional guidance. Then to enhance generation quality while preserving the autoregressive structure, we propose a autoregressive transformer module that randomly permutes the spatial order of tokens while maintaining their temporal order.

        "summary": "Timely diagnosis of Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on Computed Tomography (CT) scans remains a clinical priority, yet the development of robust Artificial Intelligence (AI) solutions is still hindered by fragmented public data. To close this gap, we introduce Hemorica, a publicly available collection of 372 head CT examinations acquired between 2012 and 2024. Each scan has been exhaustively annotated for five ICH subtypes-epidural (EPH), subdural (SDH), subarachnoid (SAH), intraparenchymal (IPH), and intraventricular (IVH)-yielding patient-wise and slice-wise classification labels, subtype-specific bounding boxes, two-dimensional pixel masks and three-dimensional voxel masks. A double-reading workflow, preceded by a pilot consensus phase and supported by neurosurgeon adjudication, maintained low inter-rater variability. Comprehensive statistical analysis confirms the clinical realism of the dataset. To establish reference baselines, standard convolutional and transformer architectures were fine-tuned for binary slice classification and hemorrhage segmentation. With only minimal fine-tuning, lightweight models such as MobileViT-XS achieved an F1 score of 87.8% in binary classification, whereas a U-Net with a DenseNet161 encoder reached a Dice score of 85.5% for binary lesion segmentation that validate both the quality of the annotations and the sufficiency of the sample size. Hemorica therefore offers a unified, fine-grained benchmark that supports multi-task and curriculum learning, facilitates transfer to larger but weakly labelled cohorts, and facilitates the process of designing an AI-based assistant for ICH detection and quantification systems.",

This paper proposes an automatic and efficient deep-learning framework for brain tumor detection from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. The framework employs a pre-trained ResNet50 model for feature extraction, followed by Global Average Pooling (GAP) and linear projection to obtain compact, high-level image representations. These features are then processed by a novel Dense-Dropout sequence, a core contribution of this work, which enhances non-linear feature learning, reduces overfitting, and improves robustness through diverse feature transformations. Another major contribution is the creation of the Mymensingh Medical College Brain Tumor (MMCBT) dataset, designed to address the lack of reliable brain tumor MRI resources. The dataset comprises MRI scans from 209 subjects (ages 9 to 65), including 3671 tumor and 13273 non-tumor images, all clinically verified under expert supervision.

        "summary": "Traditional marine biological image recognition faces challenges of incomplete datasets and unsatisfactory model accuracy, particularly for few-shot conditions of rare species where data scarcity significantly hampers the performance. To address these issues, this study proposes an intelligent marine fish recognition framework, FishAI 2.0, integrating multimodal few-shot deep learning techniques with image generation for data augmentation. First, a hierarchical marine fish benchmark dataset, which provides a comprehensive data foundation for subsequent model training, is utilized to train the FishAI 2.0 model. To address the data scarcity of rare classes, the large language model DeepSeek was employed to generate high-quality textual descriptions, which are input into Stable Diffusion 2 for image augmentation through a hierarchical diffusion strategy that extracts latent encoding to construct a multimodal feature space. The enhanced visual-textual datasets were then fed into a Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) based model, enabling robust few-shot image recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that FishAI 2.0 achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 91.67 percent and Top-5 accuracy of 97.97 percent at the family level, outperforming baseline CLIP and ViT models with a substantial margin for the minority classes with fewer than 10 training samples. To better apply FishAI 2.0 to real-world scenarios, at the genus and species level, FishAI 2.0 respectively achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 87.58 percent and 85.42 percent, demonstrating practical utility. In summary, FishAI 2.0 improves the efficiency and accuracy of marine fish identification and provides a scalable technical solution for marine ecological monitoring and conservation, highlighting its scientific value and practical applicability.",

However, they suffer two key limitations: they inherit modeling bias from the teacher, and their discrete token outputs block gradient flow, preventing post-distillation refinements such as adversarial training, reward-based fine-tuning, and Test-Time Embedding Optimization (TTEO). In this work, we introduce soft embeddings, a simple relaxation that replaces discrete tokens with the expected embeddings under the generator's output distribution. Soft embeddings preserve representation fidelity for one-step discrete generator while providing a fully differentiable continuous surrogate that is compatible with teacher backbones and tokenizer decoders. Integrating soft embeddings into the Di[M]O distillation framework (denoted Soft-Di[M]O) makes one-step generators end-to-end trainable and enables straightforward application of GAN-based refinement, differentiable reward fine-tuning, and TTEO. Empirically, across multiple MDM teachers (e.g., MaskBit, MaskGen), Soft-Di[M]O achieves state-of-the-art one-step results: improved class-to-image performance, a one-step FID of 1.56 on ImageNet-256 with GAN-based refinement, along with higher GenEval and HPS scores on text-to-image with reward fine-tuning, and further gains from TTEO.",

While 3DGS enables efficient and explicit 3D reconstruction, its parameter-based representation remains hard to learn as features, especially for neural-network-based models. Directly feeding raw Gaussian parameters into learning frameworks fails to address the non-unique and heterogeneous nature of the Gaussian parameterization, yielding highly data-dependent models. This challenge motivates us to explore a more principled approach to represent 3D Gaussian Splatting in neural networks that preserves the underlying color and geometric structure while enforcing unique mapping and channel homogeneity. In this paper, we propose an embedding representation of 3DGS based on continuous submanifold fields that encapsulate the intrinsic information of Gaussian primitives, thereby benefiting the learning of 3DGS.",

Existing set-input networks, e.g., Deep Sets and Set Transformer, are limited to vector inputs and cannot directly handle 3D image tensors. As a result, they must be cascaded with a feature extractor, typically a CNN, which encodes images into embeddings before the set-input network can model inter-image relationships. In contrast, CST operates directly on 3D image tensors, performing feature extraction and contextual modeling simultaneously, thereby enabling synergies between the two processes. This design yields superior performance in tasks such as Set Classification and Set Anomaly Detection and further provides native compatibility with CNN explainability methods such as Grad-CAM, unlike competing approaches that remain opaque. Finally, we show that CSTs can be pre-trained on large-scale datasets and subsequently adapted to new domains and tasks through standard Transfer Learning schemes. To support further research, we release CST-15, a CST backbone pre-trained on ImageNet (https://github.com/chinefed/convolutional-set-transformer).",

While learning-based methods (e.g., CNNs, transformers) offer fast inference, they often require large training datasets and struggle to match the precision of classical iterative approaches on some organ types and imaging modalities. Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a promising alternative, parameterizing deformations as continuous mappings from coordinates to displacement vectors. However, this comes at the cost of requiring instance-specific optimization, making computational efficiency and seed-dependent learning stability critical factors for these methods. In this work, we propose KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR, the first integration of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) into deformable image registration with implicit neural representations (INRs). Our proposed randomized basis sampling strategy reduces the required number of basis functions in KAN while maintaining registration quality, thereby significantly lowering computational costs. We evaluated our approach on three diverse datasets (lung CT, brain MRI, cardiac MRI) and compared it with competing instance-specific learning-based approaches, dataset-trained deep learning models, and classical registration approaches. KAN-IDIR and RandKAN-IDIR achieved the highest accuracy among INR-based methods across all evaluated modalities and anatomies, with minimal computational overhead and superior learning stability across multiple random seeds. Additionally, we discovered that our RandKAN-IDIR model with randomized basis sampling slightly outperforms the model with learnable basis function indices, while eliminating its additional training-time complexity.",

We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by synthesizing event data for visual recognition, 2D skeleton estimation, and 3D body pose estimation.

Accurate delineation of internal gross tumor volume (IGTV) in PET/CT imaging is pivotal for optimal radiation therapy in mobile tumors such as lung cancer to account for tumor motion, yet is hindered by the limited availability of annotated IGTV datasets and attenuated PET signal intensity at tumor boundaries. In this study, we present a transfer learningbased methodology utilizing a multimodal interactive perception network with MAMBA, pre-trained on extensive gross tumor volume (GTV) datasets and subsequently fine-tuned on a private IGTV cohort. This cohort constitutes the PET/CT subset of the Lung-cancer Unified Cross-modal Imaging Dataset (LUCID). To further address the challenge of weak PET intensities in IGTV peripheral slices, we introduce a slice interaction module (SIM) within a 2.5D segmentation framework to effectively model inter-slice relationships. Our proposed module integrates channel and spatial attention branches with depthwise convolutions, enabling more robust learning of slice-to-slice dependencies and thereby improving overall segmentation performance. A comprehensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that our approach achieves a Dice of 0.609 on the private IGTV dataset, substantially surpassing the conventional baseline score of 0.385. This work highlights the potential of transfer learning, coupled with advanced multimodal techniques and a SIM to enhance the reliability and clinical relevance of IGTV segmentation for lung cancer radiation therapy planning.",

Traditional post-hoc methods for temporal saliency detection are computationally expensive, particularly when compared to feature importance detection. While ablation techniques may suffice for datasets with fewer features, identifying temporal saliency poses greater challenges due to its complexity. We validate CrossScaleNet on synthetic datasets with known saliency ground truth and on established public benchmarks, demonstrating the robustness of our method in identifying temporal saliency. Experiments on real-world datasets for forecasting task show that our approach consistently outperforms most transformer-based models, offering better explainability without sacrificing predictive accuracy. Our evaluations demonstrate superior performance in both temporal saliency detection and forecasting accuracy. Moreover, we highlight that existing models claiming explainability often fail to maintain strong performance on standard benchmarks.

Importantly, we show that our method not only outperforms prior white-box attacks and untargeted baselines, but also surpasses existing non-realistic approaches that produce detectable artifacts.

However, recent large Vision-Language Models (VLMs), despite their broad applicability, remain underexplored in their ability to adapt to individual users. In this paper, we introduce MMPB, the first extensive benchmark for evaluating VLMs on personalization. MMPB comprises 10k image-query pairs and includes 111 personalizable concepts across four categories: humans, animals, objects, and characters, with the human category enriched with preference-grounded queries. We structure personalization into three main task types, each highlighting a different key property of VLMs. Using 23 widely used VLMs including both open- and closed-source models, we evaluate personalization performance via a three-stage protocol: concept injection, multi-turn dialogue, and personalized querying. Our findings indicate that most VLMs (including some closed-source models) struggle with personalization, particularly in maintaining consistency over dialogue, handling user preferences, and adapting to visual cues. Our analysis reveals that the challenges in VLM personalization (such as refusal behaviors and long-context forgetting) highlight substantial room for improvement. By identifying these limitations and offering a scalable benchmark, MMPB offers valuable insights and a solid foundation for future research toward truly personalized multi-modal AI.

However, it often faces challenges in striking a trade-off between aligning with the target distribution: learning a novel concept from a limited image for personalization and retaining the instruction ability needed for unifying multiple tasks, all while maintaining editability (aligning with a variety of prompts or in-context generation). In this work, we introduce DEFT, Decompositional Efficient Fine-Tuning, an efficient fine-tuning framework that adapts a pre-trained weight matrix by decomposing its update into two components with two trainable matrices: (1) a projection onto the complement of a low-rank subspace spanned by a low-rank matrix, and (2) a low-rank update. The single trainable low-rank matrix defines the subspace, while the other trainable low-rank matrix enables flexible parameter adaptation within that subspace. We conducted extensive experiments on the Dreambooth and Dreambench Plus datasets for personalization, the InsDet dataset for object and scene adaptation, and the VisualCloze dataset for a universal image generation framework through visual in-context learning with both Stable Diffusion and a unified model. Our results demonstrated state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the emergent properties of efficient fine-tuning. Our code is available on \\href{https://github.com/MAXNORM8650/DEFT}{DEFTBase}.",

        "summary": "Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to identify both known and novel categories within unlabeled data by leveraging a set of labeled examples from known categories. Existing GCD methods primarily depend on semantic labels and global image representations, often overlooking the detailed part-level cues that are crucial for distinguishing closely related categories. In this paper, we introduce PartCo, short for Part-Level Correspondence Prior, a novel framework that enhances category discovery by incorporating part-level visual feature correspondences. By leveraging part-level relationships, PartCo captures finer-grained semantic structures, enabling a more nuanced understanding of category relationships. Importantly, PartCo seamlessly integrates with existing GCD methods without requiring significant modifications. Our extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that PartCo significantly improves the performance of current GCD approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results by bridging the gap between semantic labels and part-level visual compositions, thereby setting new benchmarks for GCD.

        "summary": "Background: Breast and thyroid cancers pose an increasing public-health burden. Ultrasound imaging is a cost-effective, real-time modality for lesion detection and segmentation, yet suffers from speckle noise, overlapping structures, and weak global-local feature interactions. Existing networks struggle to reconcile high-level semantics with low-level spatial details. We aim to develop a segmentation framework that bridges the semantic gap between global context and local detail in noisy ultrasound images. Methods: We propose UESA-Net, a U-shaped network with multidirectional shrinkage attention. The encoder-decoder architecture captures long-range dependencies and fine-grained structures of lesions. Within each encoding block, attention modules operate along horizontal, vertical, and depth directions to exploit spatial details, while a shrinkage (threshold) strategy integrates prior knowledge and local features. The decoder mirrors the encoder but applies a pairwise shrinkage mechanism, combining prior low-level physical cues with corresponding encoder features to enhance context modeling. Results: On two public datasets - TN3K (3493 images) and BUSI (780 images) - UESA-Net achieved state-of-the-art performance with intersection-over-union (IoU) scores of 0.8487 and 0.6495, respectively. Conclusions: UESA-Net effectively aggregates multidirectional spatial information and prior knowledge to improve robustness and accuracy in breast and thyroid ultrasound segmentation, demonstrating superior performance to existing methods on multiple benchmarks.",

        "summary": "Reasoning-augmented machine learning systems have shown improved performance in various domains, including image generation. However, existing reasoning-based methods for image generation either restrict reasoning to a single modality (image or text) or rely on high-quality reasoning data for fine-tuning. To tackle these limitations, we propose MILR, a test-time method that jointly reasons over image and text in a unified latent vector space. Reasoning in MILR is performed by searching through vector representations of discrete image and text tokens. Practically, this is implemented via the policy gradient method, guided by an image quality critic. We instantiate MILR within the unified multimodal understanding and generation (MUG) framework that natively supports language reasoning before image synthesis and thus facilitates cross-modal reasoning. The intermediate model outputs, which are to be optimized, serve as the unified latent space, enabling MILR to operate entirely at test time. We evaluate MILR on GenEval, T2I-CompBench, and WISE, achieving state-of-the-art results on all benchmarks. Notably, on knowledge-intensive WISE, MILR attains an overall score of 0.63, improving over the baseline by 80%. Our further analysis indicates that joint reasoning in the unified latent space is the key to its strong performance. Moreover, our qualitative studies reveal MILR's non-trivial ability in temporal and cultural reasoning, highlighting the efficacy of our reasoning method.",

It is derived from two auxiliary datasets that we constructed: TallyBench (2000 counting images with QA) and HistCaps (515 historical images with bilingual captions). We evaluate both closed-source APIs (OpenAI, Gemini, Claude) and open-source models (Qwen2.5-VL and Qwen3-VL series). Results show clear scaling trends but also reveal critical limitations: even the strongest models consistently fail at temporal ordering and spatial relations, and they often make mistakes in basic counting and geometric comparisons that are trivial for humans. These findings demonstrate that visual comparison remains a systematic blind spot for current VLMs. By providing controlled, diverse, and diagnostic evaluation, CompareBench establishes a foundation for advancing more reliable multimodal reasoning.",

        "summary": "Designing realistic multi-object scenes requires not only generating images, but also planning spatial layouts that respect semantic relations and physical plausibility. On one hand, while recent advances in diffusion models have enabled high-quality image generation, they lack explicit spatial reasoning, leading to unrealistic object layouts. On the other hand, traditional spatial planning methods in robotics emphasize geometric and relational consistency, but they struggle to capture semantic richness in visual scenes. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose LayoutAgent, an agentic framework that unifies vision-language reasoning with compositional diffusion for layout generation. Given multiple input images with target objects in them, our method first employs visual-language model to preprocess the inputs through segmentation, object size estimation, scene graph construction, and prompt rewriting. Then we leverage compositional diffusion-a method traditionally used in robotics-to synthesize bounding boxes that respect object relations encoded in the scene graph for spatial layouts. In the end, a foreground-conditioned image generator composes the complete scene by rendering the objects into the planned layout guided by designed prompts. Experiments demonstrate that LayoutAgent outperforms other state-of-the-art layout generation models in layout coherence, spatial realism and aesthetic alignment.",

GZSL leverages generative models like GANs or VAEs to synthesize realistic features (real features) of unseen classes. This allows the model to label unseen classes during testing, despite being trained only on seen classes. In this context, we introduce the Generalized Zero-Shot Learning based-upon Mixture-of-Experts (GZSL-MoE) model. This model incorporates Mixture-of-Experts layers (MoE) to generate fake features that closely resemble real features extracted using a pre-trained KPConv (Kernel Point Convolution) model on seen classes. The main contribution of this paper is the integration of Mixture-of-Experts into the Generator and Discriminator components of the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation, applied to the COVERED dataset (CollabOratiVE Robot Environment Dataset) for Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) environments. By combining the Generative Zero-Shot Learning model with Mixture-of- Experts, GZSL-MoE for 3D point cloud semantic segmentation provides a promising solution for understanding complex 3D environments, especially when comprehensive training data for all object classes is unavailable. The performance evaluation of the GZSL-MoE model highlights its ability to enhance performance on both seen and unseen classes.

        "summary": "Federated Prompt Learning (FPL) enables communication-efficient adaptation by tuning lightweight prompts on top of frozen pre-trained models. Existing FPL methods typically rely on global information, which is only available after the second training round, to facilitate collaboration among client models. Therefore, they are inherently dependent on multi-round communication to fully exhibit their strengths. Moreover, existing one-shot federated learning methods typically focus on fitting seen tasks, but lack cross-task generalization. To bridge this gap, we propose the Global Prompt Refinement with Non-Interfering Attention Masking (GPR-NIAM) method for one-shot FPL. The core idea is to design a masking mechanism that restricts excessive interaction between the original text embeddings and the learnable prompt embeddings. GPR-NIAM achieves this through the collaboration of two key modules. Firstly, the attention isolation module suppresses attention from the learnable prompt tokens to the original text tokens, and reweights the reverse attention which preserves generalization across tasks. Secondly, the cross-silo collaborative refinement module integrates decentralized visual knowledge into a unified base and calibrates the global prompt through multi-source cross-modal knowledge alignment, further mitigating the inconsistency caused by data heterogeneity. Extensive experiments conducted on ten benchmark datasets under two tasks show that GPR-NIAM outperforms eight state-of-the-art methods in both class-level and domain-level generalization.",

        "summary": "As data requirements continue to grow, efficient learning increasingly depends on the curation and distillation of high-value data rather than brute-force scaling of model sizes. In the case of a hyperspectral image (HSI), the challenge is amplified by the high-dimensional 3D voxel structure, where each spatial location is associated with hundreds of contiguous spectral channels. While vision and language models have been optimized effectively for natural image or text tasks, their cross-modal alignment in the hyperspectral domain remains an open and underexplored problem. In this article, we make an attempt to optimize a Vision-Language Model (VLM) for hyperspectral scene understanding by exploiting a CLIP-style contrastive training framework. Our framework maps voxel-level embeddings from a vision backbone onto the latent space of a frozen large embedding model (LEM), where a trainable probe aligns vision features with the model's textual token representations. The two modalities are aligned via a contrastive loss restricted to a curated set of hard (closest wrong classes) and semi-hard (random distractors) negatives, along with positive pairs. To further enhance alignment, descriptive prompts that encode class semantics are introduced and act as structured anchors for the HSI embeddings. It is seen that the proposed method updates only 0.07 percent of the total parameters, yet yields state-of-the-art performance. For example, on Indian Pines (IP) the model produces better results over unimodal and multimodal baselines by +0.92 Overall Accuracy (OA) and +1.60 Kappa ($\\kappa$), while on Pavia University (PU) data it provides gains of +0.69 OA and +0.90 $\\kappa$. Moreover, this is achieved with the set of parameters, nearly 50$\\times$ smaller than DCTN and 90$\\times$ smaller than SS-TMNet.",

We further identify Mamba's selective scan enables gradual information aggregation in hidden states. Based on these insights, we propose Sequential Token Merging (STM), featuring: 1) Bidirectional nearest neighbor merging to preserve sequential dependencies through symmetric spatial aggregation, and 2) Hidden states protection to stabilize the hidden states around the class token. STM strategically leverages Mamba's layer-wise loss convergence to convert temporal forgetfulness into stability. Experiments demonstrate STM's superiority: 1.0% accuracy drop for ViM-Ti at 20% token reduction, and only 1.4% degradation for ViM-S at 40% reduction.

We introduce MATS (Multimodal Audit for Truthful Spatialization), a compact behavioral audit that measures whether models reject visually contradicted statements, and two metrics Spatial Consistency Score (SCS) and Incorrect Agreement Rate (IAR). Instruction tuned generative VLMs (LLaVA 1.5, QwenVLchat) exhibit very low SCS and high IAR, while contrastive encoders (CLIP, SigLIP) are far more robust. Activation patching causally localizes failure loci (mid to late cross attention for generative models, pooled projection components for contrastive models) and suggests concrete repair paths.",

However, existing zero-shot LLM-based Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) agents either encode images as textual scene descriptions, potentially oversimplifying visual details, or process raw image inputs, which can fail to capture abstract semantics required for high-level reasoning. In this paper, we improve the navigation agent's contextual understanding by incorporating textual descriptions from multiple perspectives that facilitate analogical reasoning across images. By leveraging text-based analogical reasoning, the agent enhances its global scene understanding and spatial reasoning, leading to more accurate action decisions.

We propose a simple yet effective refinement approach taking advantage of the assumption that layers often exhibit uniform appearance in graphic designs. As decomposition is ill-posed and the ground-truth layer structure may not be reliable, we develop a quality metric that addresses the difficulty.

        "summary": "Recent 3D generative models produce high-quality textures for 3D mesh objects. However, they commonly rely on the heavy assumption that input 3D meshes are accompanied by manual mesh parameterization (UV mapping), a manual task that requires both technical precision and artistic judgment. Industry surveys show that this process often accounts for a significant share of asset creation, creating a major bottleneck for 3D content creators. Moreover, existing automatic methods often ignore two perceptually important criteria: (1) semantic awareness (UV charts should align semantically similar 3D parts across shapes) and (2) visibility awareness (cutting seams should lie in regions unlikely to be seen). To overcome these shortcomings and to automate the mesh parameterization process, we present an unsupervised differentiable framework that augments standard geometry-preserving UV learning with semantic- and visibility-aware objectives. For semantic-awareness, our pipeline (i) segments the mesh into semantic 3D parts, (ii) applies an unsupervised learned per-part UV-parameterization backbone, and (iii) aggregates per-part charts into a unified UV atlas. For visibility-awareness, we use ambient occlusion (AO) as an exposure proxy and back-propagate a soft differentiable AO-weighted seam objective to steer cutting seams toward occluded regions. By conducting qualitative and quantitative evaluations against state-of-the-art methods, we show that the proposed method produces UV atlases that better support texture generation and reduce perceptible seam artifacts compared to recent baselines.

Progress in robust mobile manipulation requires large-scale multimodal datasets that capture contact-rich and long-horizon tasks, yet existing resources lack synchronized force-torque sensing, hierarchical annotations, and explicit failure cases. We address this gap with the AIRoA MoMa Dataset, a large-scale real-world multimodal dataset for mobile manipulation. It includes synchronized RGB images, joint states, six-axis wrist force-torque signals, and internal robot states, together with a novel two-layer annotation schema of sub-goals and primitive actions for hierarchical learning and error analysis. The initial dataset comprises 25,469 episodes (approx. 94 hours) collected with the Human Support Robot (HSR) and is fully standardized in the LeRobot v2.1 format. By uniquely integrating mobile manipulation, contact-rich interaction, and long-horizon structure, AIRoA MoMa provides a critical benchmark for advancing the next generation of Vision-Language-Action models.

        "summary": "Wildfires are among the most severe natural hazards, posing a significant threat to both humans and natural ecosystems. The growing risk of wildfires increases the demand for forecasting models that are not only accurate but also reliable. Deep Learning (DL) has shown promise in predicting wildfire danger; however, its adoption is hindered by concerns over the reliability of its predictions, some of which stem from the lack of uncertainty quantification. To address this challenge, we present an uncertainty-aware DL framework that jointly captures epistemic (model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainty to enhance short-term wildfire danger forecasting. In the next-day forecasting, our best-performing model improves the F1 Score by 2.3% and reduces the Expected Calibration Error by 2.1% compared to a deterministic baseline, enhancing both predictive skill and calibration. Our experiments confirm the reliability of the uncertainty estimates and illustrate their practical utility for decision support, including the identification of uncertainty thresholds for rejecting low-confidence predictions and the generation of well-calibrated wildfire danger maps with accompanying uncertainty layers. Extending the forecast horizon up to ten days, we observe that aleatoric uncertainty increases with time, showing greater variability in environmental conditions, while epistemic uncertainty remains stable. Finally, we show that although the two uncertainty types may be redundant in low-uncertainty cases, they provide complementary insights under more challenging conditions, underscoring the value of their joint modeling for robust wildfire danger prediction. In summary, our approach significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of wildfire danger forecasting, advancing the development of trustworthy wildfire DL systems.",

We present a theoretical and empirical study of score-based MIAs, focusing on the predicted noise vectors that diffusion models learn to approximate. We show that the expected denoiser output points toward a kernel-weighted local mean of nearby training samples, such that its norm encodes proximity to the training set and thereby reveals membership. Building on this observation, we propose SimA, a single-query attack that provides a principled, efficient alternative to existing multi-query methods. SimA achieves consistently strong performance across variants of DDPM, Latent Diffusion Model (LDM). Notably, we find that Latent Diffusion Models are surprisingly less vulnerable than pixel-space models, due to the strong information bottleneck imposed by their latent auto-encoder. We further investigate this by differing the regularization hyperparameters ($\\beta$ in $\\beta$-VAE) in latent channel and suggest a strategy to make LDM training more robust to MIA. Our results solidify the theory of score-based MIAs, while highlighting that Latent Diffusion class of methods requires better understanding of inversion for VAE, and not simply inversion of the Diffusion process",

In this context, primitive-based shape abstraction offers a promising solution for UGC scenarios by compressing high-resolution meshes into compact, editable representations. Towards this end, effective shape abstraction must therefore be structure-aware, characterized by low overlap between primitives, part-aware alignment, and primitive compactness. We present Light-SQ, a novel superquadric-based optimization framework that explicitly emphasizes structure-awareness from three aspects. (a) We introduce SDF carving to iteratively udpate the target signed distance field, discouraging overlap between primitives. (b) We propose a block-regrow-fill strategy guided by structure-aware volumetric decomposition, enabling structural partitioning to drive primitive placement. (c) We implement adaptive residual pruning based on SDF update history to surpress over-segmentation and ensure compact results. In addition, Light-SQ supports multiscale fitting, enabling localized refinement to preserve fine geometric details. To evaluate our method, we introduce 3DGen-Prim, a benchmark extending 3DGen-Bench with new metrics for both reconstruction quality and primitive-level editability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Light-SQ enables efficient, high-fidelity, and editable shape abstraction with superquadrics for complex generated geometry, advancing the feasibility of 3D UGC creation.",

Despite its importance, current state-of-the-art models still suffer from severe limitations that prevent the successful development of a fully multimodal model.

As a result, some modalities may not be aligned, undermining the effectiveness of the model in downstream tasks where multiple modalities should provide additional information that the model fails to exploit. In this paper, we present TRIANGLE: TRI-modAl Neural Geometric LEarning, the novel proposed similarity measure that is directly computed in the higher-dimensional space spanned by the modality embeddings. TRIANGLE improves the joint alignment of three modalities via a triangle-area similarity, avoiding additional fusion layers or pairwise similarities. When incorporated in contrastive losses replacing cosine similarity, TRIANGLE significantly boosts the performance of multimodal modeling, while yielding interpretable alignment rationales. Extensive evaluation in three-modal tasks such as video-text and audio-text retrieval or audio-video classification, demonstrates that TRIANGLE achieves state-of-the-art results across different datasets improving the performance of cosine-based methods up to 9 points of Recall@1.",

This capability is crucial for achieving versatile robotic manipulation in diverse environments and requires substantial amounts of reliable and diverse grasp data for effective model training and robust generalization. However, existing approaches either rely on physics-based optimization that lacks human-like kinematic understanding or require extensive manual data collection processes that are limited to anthropomorphic structures. In this paper, we propose CEDex, a novel cross-embodiment dexterous grasp synthesis method at scale that bridges human grasping kinematics and robot kinematics by aligning robot kinematic models with generated human-like contact representations. Given an object's point cloud and an arbitrary robotic hand model, CEDex first generates human-like contact representations using a Conditional Variational Auto-encoder pretrained on human contact data. It then performs kinematic human contact alignment through topological merging to consolidate multiple human hand parts into unified robot components, followed by a signed distance field-based grasp optimization with physics-aware constraints. Using CEDex, we construct the largest cross-embodiment grasp dataset to date, comprising 500K objects across four gripper types with 20M total grasps.

These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First, in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation, classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers.",

A common approach is to formulate the problem in a Bayesian framework and sample from the posterior by combining the prior score with the likelihood score. Since the likelihood term is often intractable, estimators like DPS, DMPS, and $\\pi$GDM are widely adopted. However, these methods rely on a fixed, manually tuned scale to balance prior and likelihood contributions. Such a static design is suboptimal, as the ideal balance varies across timesteps and tasks, limiting performance and generalization.

In the preprocessing stage, noise filtering is performed by fuzzy filtering, artefact removal is performed by non-linear diffusion filtering, and the contrast improvement is performed by a novel filter called Adaptive Variable Distance Speckle (AVDS) filter. The AVDS filter employs four distance calculation methods such as Euclidean, Bhattacharya, Manhattan, and Hamming. The filter adaptively chooses a distance method which produces the highest contrast value amongst all 3 methods. From the analysis, hamming distance method was found to achieve better results for contrast and Euclidean distance showing less error value with high PSNR.

        "summary": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have gained significant traction in both computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence for their potential in energy-efficient computing. In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) excel at gradient-based optimization and high accuracy. This contrast has consequently led to a growing subfield of hybrid ANN-SNN research. However, existing hybrid approaches often rely on either a strict separation between ANN and SNN components or employ SNN-only encoders followed by ANN classifiers due to the constraints of non-differentiability of spike encoding functions, causing prior hybrid architectures to lack deep layer-wise cooperation during backpropagation. To address this gap, we propose a novel hybrid ANN-SNN framework that integrates layer-wise encode-decode SNN blocks within conventional ANN pipelines. Central to our method is the use of surrogate gradients for a bit-plane-based spike encoding function, enabling end-to-end differentiable training across ANN and SNN layers. This design achieves competitive accuracy with state-of-the-art pure ANN and SNN models while retaining the potential efficiency and temporal representation benefits of spiking computation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first implementation of a surrogate gradient for bit plane coding specifically and spike encoder interface in general to be utilized in the context of hybrid ANN-SNN, successfully leading to a new class of hybrid models that pave new directions for future research.",

        "summary": "Sea surface temperature (SST) is an essential indicator of global climate change and one of the most intuitive factors reflecting ocean conditions. Obtaining high-resolution SST data remains challenging due to limitations in physical imaging, and super-resolution via deep neural networks is a promising solution. Recently, Mamba-based approaches leveraging State Space Models (SSM) have demonstrated significant potential for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity. However, their application to SST data super-resolution remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the Wavelet-assisted Mamba Super-Resolution (WMSR) framework for satellite-derived SST data. The WMSR includes two key components: the Low-Frequency State Space Module (LFSSM) and High-Frequency Enhancement Module (HFEM). The LFSSM uses 2D-SSM to capture global information of the input data, and the robust global modeling capabilities of SSM are exploited to preserve the critical temperature information in the low-frequency component. The HFEM employs the pixel difference convolution to match and correct the high-frequency feature, achieving accurate and clear textures. Through comprehensive experiments on three SST datasets, our WMSR demonstrated superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Beyond technical metrics, we visualize a \"creativity trait-space\" and illustrate how it can support interpretable, trait-aware co-creation - e.g., sliding along a Redemptive Arc axis to explore works of adversity and renewal.

        "summary": "Online free-viewpoint video (FVV) reconstruction is challenged by slow per-frame optimization, inconsistent motion estimation, and unsustainable storage demands. To address these challenges, we propose the Reconfigurable Continuum Gaussian Stream, dubbed ReCon-GS, a novel storage-aware framework that enables high fidelity online dynamic scene reconstruction and real-time rendering. Specifically, we dynamically allocate multi-level Anchor Gaussians in a density-adaptive fashion to capture inter-frame geometric deformations, thereby decomposing scene motion into compact coarse-to-fine representations. Then, we design a dynamic hierarchy reconfiguration strategy that preserves localized motion expressiveness through on-demand anchor re-hierarchization, while ensuring temporal consistency through intra-hierarchical deformation inheritance that confines transformation priors to their respective hierarchy levels. Furthermore, we introduce a storage-aware optimization mechanism that flexibly adjusts the density of Anchor Gaussians at different hierarchy levels, enabling a controllable trade-off between reconstruction fidelity and memory usage. Extensive experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that, compared to state-of-the-art methods, ReCon-GS improves training efficiency by approximately 15% and achieves superior FVV synthesis quality with enhanced robustness and stability. Moreover, at equivalent rendering quality, ReCon-GS slashes memory requirements by over 50% compared to leading state-of-the-art methods.",

        "summary": "Video Joint Embedding Predictive Architectures (V-JEPA) learn generalizable off-the-shelf video representation by predicting masked regions in latent space with an exponential moving average (EMA)-updated teacher. While EMA prevents representation collapse, it complicates scalable model selection and couples teacher and student architectures. We revisit masked-latent prediction and show that a frozen teacher suffices. Concretely, we (i) train a target encoder with a simple pixel-reconstruction objective under V-JEPA masking, then (ii) freeze it and train a student to predict the teacher's latents on masked regions. This leads to a two-stage, unregularized scheme that we refer to as SALT (Static-teacher Asymmetric Latent Training). SALT decouples optimization into pixel reconstruction (teacher) and masked latent prediction (student), increasing transparency, efficiency, and scalability while preserving the ability of representation to generalize under frozen evaluation. Empirically, our student models outperform recently proposed V-JEPA 2 encoders under frozen backbone evaluation across diverse benchmarks. They are also more compute-optimal: at matched pretraining FLOPs, our method achieves higher probing accuracy, and its scaling curves dominate V-JEPA's accuracy-FLOPs Pareto frontier. Finally, we find that student quality is remarkably robust to teacher quality: high-performing students emerge even with small, sub-optimal teachers. This points to a compute budget allocation that should overwhelmingly favor the student. These results position SALT as a simple, scalable, and compute-efficient alternative to EMA-based self-distillation for video representation learning.",

We address this challenge through a combination of learning-based initialization with optimization-based refinement. Our method employs a camera pose regression network to predict metric-aware relative poses from consecutive RGB-D frames, which serve as reliable starting points for a randomized optimization algorithm that further aligns depth images with the scene geometry. Extensive experiments demonstrate promising results: our approach outperforms the best competitor on challenging benchmarks, while maintaining comparable accuracy on stable motion sequences.

However, mpMRI remains limited by false positives, false negatives, and moderate to substantial interobserver agreement. Time-dependent diffusion (TDD) MRI, a novel sequence that enables tissue microstructure characterization, has shown encouraging preclinical performance in distinguishing clinically significant from insignificant PCa. Combining TDD-derived metrics with machine learning may provide robust, zone-specific risk prediction with less dependence on reader training and improved accuracy compared to current standard-of-care.

        "summary": "Point clouds are widely used representations of 3D data, but determining the visibility of points from a given viewpoint remains a challenging problem due to their sparse nature and lack of explicit connectivity. Traditional methods, such as Hidden Point Removal (HPR), face limitations in computational efficiency, robustness to noise, and handling concave regions or low-density point clouds. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to visibility determination in point clouds by formulating it as a binary classification task. The core of our network consists of a 3D U-Net that extracts view-independent point-wise features and a shared multi-layer perceptron (MLP) that predicts point visibility using the extracted features and view direction as inputs. The network is trained end-to-end with ground-truth visibility labels generated from rendered 3D models. Our method significantly outperforms HPR in both accuracy and computational efficiency, achieving up to 126 times speedup on large point clouds. Additionally, our network demonstrates robustness to noise and varying point cloud densities and generalizes well to unseen shapes. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on the ShapeNet, ABC Dataset and real-world datasets, showing substantial improvements in visibility accuracy. We also demonstrate the versatility of our method in various applications, including point cloud visualization, surface reconstruction, normal estimation, shadow rendering, and viewpoint optimization.

        "summary": "Most robot manipulation focuses on changing the kinematic state of objects: picking, placing, opening, or rotating them. However, a wide range of real-world manipulation tasks involve a different class of object state change--such as mashing, spreading, or slicing--where the object's physical and visual state evolve progressively without necessarily changing its position. We present SPARTA, the first unified framework for the family of object state change manipulation tasks. Our key insight is that these tasks share a common structural pattern: they involve spatially-progressing, object-centric changes that can be represented as regions transitioning from an actionable to a transformed state. Building on this insight, SPARTA integrates spatially progressing object change segmentation maps, a visual skill to perceive actionable vs. transformed regions for specific object state change tasks, to generate a) structured policy observations that strip away appearance variability, and b) dense rewards that capture incremental progress over time. These are leveraged in two SPARTA policy variants: reinforcement learning for fine-grained control without demonstrations or simulation; and greedy control for fast, lightweight deployment. We validate SPARTA on a real robot for three challenging tasks across 10 diverse real-world objects, achieving significant improvements in training time and accuracy over sparse rewards and visual goal-conditioned baselines. Our results highlight progress-aware visual representations as a versatile foundation for the broader family of object state manipulation tasks.

        "summary": "The global attention mechanism is one of the keys to the success of transformer architecture, but it incurs quadratic computational costs in relation to the number of tokens. On the other hand, equivariant models, which leverage the underlying geometric structures of problem instance, often achieve superior accuracy in physical, biochemical, computer vision, and robotic tasks, at the cost of additional compute requirements. As a result, existing equivariant transformers only support low-order equivariant features and local context windows, limiting their expressiveness and performance. This work proposes Clebsch-Gordan Transformer, achieving efficient global attention by a novel Clebsch-Gordon Convolution on $\\SO(3)$ irreducible representations. Our method enables equivariant modeling of features at all orders while achieving ${O}(N \\log N)$ input token complexity. Additionally, the proposed method scales well with high-order irreducible features, by exploiting the sparsity of the Clebsch-Gordon matrix. Lastly, we also incorporate optional token permutation equivariance through either weight sharing or data augmentation. We benchmark our method on a diverse set of benchmarks including n-body simulation, QM9, ModelNet point cloud classification and a robotic grasping dataset, showing clear gains over existing equivariant transformers in GPU memory size, speed, and accuracy.",

A single Awair HOME monitor sampled every five minutes from 14 October 2024 to 9 January 2025, producing more than 23,000 time-stamped observations that are fully quality-controlled and publicly archived on Figshare. We describe the sensor placement, ISO-compliant mounting height, calibration checks against reference instruments, and an open-source processing pipeline that normalizes timestamps, interpolates short gaps, and exports analysis-ready tables. Exploratory statistics show stable conditions (median CO2 = 758 ppm; PM2.5 = 12 micrograms/m3) with pronounced feeding-time peaks, offering rich structure for short-horizon forecasting, event detection, and sensor drift studies.

Neurons with similar response properties are spatially clustered, forming smooth maps for acoustic features such as frequency in early auditory areas, and modular regions selective for music and speech in higher-order cortex. Yet, evaluations for current computational models of auditory perception do not measure whether such topographic structure is present in a candidate model. Here, we show that cortical topography is not present in the previous best-performing models at predicting human auditory fMRI responses. To encourage the emergence of topographic organization, we adapt a cortical wiring-constraint loss originally designed for visual perception. The new class of topographic auditory models, TopoAudio, are trained to classify speech, and environmental sounds from cochleagram inputs, with an added constraint that nearby units on a 2D cortical sheet develop similar tuning. Despite these additional constraints, TopoAudio achieves high accuracy on benchmark tasks comparable to the unconstrained non-topographic baseline models. Further, TopoAudio predicts the fMRI responses in the brain as well as standard models, but unlike standard models, TopoAudio develops smooth, topographic maps for tonotopy and amplitude modulation (common properties of early auditory representation, as well as clustered response modules for music and speech (higher-order selectivity observed in the human auditory cortex). TopoAudio is the first end-to-end biologically grounded auditory model to exhibit emergent topography, and our results emphasize that a wiring-length constraint can serve as a general-purpose regularization tool to achieve biologically aligned representations.",

        "summary": "In Diffusion Transformer (DiT) models, particularly for video generation, attention latency is a major bottleneck due to the long sequence length and the quadratic complexity. We find that attention weights can be separated into two parts: a small fraction of large weights with high rank and the remaining weights with very low rank. This naturally suggests applying sparse acceleration to the first part and low-rank acceleration to the second. Based on this finding, we propose SLA (Sparse-Linear Attention), a trainable attention method that fuses sparse and linear attention to accelerate diffusion models. SLA classifies attention weights into critical, marginal, and negligible categories, applying O(N^2) attention to critical weights, O(N) attention to marginal weights, and skipping negligible ones. SLA combines these computations into a single GPU kernel and supports both forward and backward passes. With only a few fine-tuning steps using SLA, DiT models achieve a 20x reduction in attention computation, resulting in significant acceleration without loss of generation quality. Experiments show that SLA reduces attention computation by 95% without degrading end-to-end generation quality, outperforming baseline methods. In addition, we implement an efficient GPU kernel for SLA, which yields a 13.7x speedup in attention computation and a 2.2x end-to-end speedup in video generation on Wan2.1-1.3B.",

        "summary": "End-to-end deep learning models fed with multi-band galaxy images are powerful data-driven tools used to estimate galaxy physical properties in the absence of spectroscopy. However, due to a lack of interpretability and the associational nature of such models, it is difficult to understand how the information additional to integrated photometry (e.g., morphology) contributes to the estimation task. Improving our understanding in this field would enable further advances into unraveling the physical connections among galaxy properties and optimizing data exploitation. Therefore, our work is aimed at interpreting the deep learning-based estimation of stellar mass via two interpretability techniques: causal analysis and mutual information decomposition. The former reveals the causal paths between multiple variables beyond nondirectional statistical associations, while the latter quantifies the multicomponent contributions (i.e., redundant, unique, and synergistic) of different input data to the stellar mass estimation. Using data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we obtained meaningful results that provide physical interpretations for image-based models. Our work demonstrates the gains from combining deep learning with interpretability techniques, and holds promise in promoting more data-driven astrophysical research (e.g., astrophysical parameter estimations and investigations on complex multivariate physical processes).",

        "summary": "Knowledge distillation (KD) is a vital technique for deploying deep neural networks (DNNs) on resource-constrained devices by transferring knowledge from large teacher models to lightweight student models. While teacher models from third-party platforms may undergo security verification (\\eg, backdoor detection), we uncover a novel and critical threat: distillation-conditional backdoor attacks (DCBAs). DCBA injects dormant and undetectable backdoors into teacher models, which become activated in student models via the KD process, even with clean distillation datasets. While the direct extension of existing methods is ineffective for DCBA, we implement this attack by formulating it as a bilevel optimization problem and proposing a simple yet effective method (\\ie, SCAR). Specifically, the inner optimization simulates the KD process by optimizing a surrogate student model, while the outer optimization leverages outputs from this surrogate to optimize the teacher model for implanting the conditional backdoor. Our SCAR addresses this complex optimization utilizing an implicit differentiation algorithm with a pre-optimized trigger injection function. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model architectures, and KD techniques validate the effectiveness of our SCAR and its resistance against existing backdoor detection, highlighting a significant yet previously overlooked vulnerability in the KD process.

        "summary": "Vision-language model (VLM) based GUI agents show promise for automating complex desktop and mobile tasks, but face significant challenges in applying reinforcement learning (RL): (1) slow multi-turn interactions with GUI environments for policy rollout, and (2) insufficient high-quality agent-environment interactions for policy learning. To address these challenges, we propose DART, a Decoupled Agentic RL Training framework for GUI agents, which coordinates heterogeneous modules in a highly decoupled manner. DART separates the training system into four asynchronous modules: environment cluster, rollout service, data manager, and trainer. This design enables non-blocking communication, asynchronous training, rollout-wise trajectory sampling, and per-worker model synchronization, significantly improving the system efficiency: 1.6*GPU utilization for rollout, 1.9* training throughput, and 5.5* environment utilization. To facilitate effective learning from abundant samples, we introduce an adaptive data curation scheme: (1) pre-collecting successful trajectories for challenging tasks to supplement sparse success in online sampling; (2) dynamically adjusting rollout numbers and trajectory lengths based on task difficulty; (3) training selectively on high-entropy steps to prioritize critical decisions; (4) stabilizing learning via truncated importance sampling for policy mismatch between policy rollout and updating. On the OSWorld benchmark, DART-GUI-7B achieves a 42.13% task success rate, a 14.61% absolute gain over the base model, and 7.34% higher than open-source SOTA. We will fully open-source our training framework, data, and model checkpoints via computer-use-agents.github.io/dart-gui, which we believe is a timely contribution to the open-source community of agentic RL training.",

This paper introduces ReLumix, a novel framework that decouples the relighting algorithm from temporal synthesis, thereby enabling any image relighting technique to be seamlessly applied to video. Our approach reformulates video relighting into a simple yet effective two-stage process: (1) an artist relights a single reference frame using any preferred image-based technique (e.g., Diffusion Models, physics-based renderers); and (2) a fine-tuned stable video diffusion (SVD) model seamlessly propagates this target illumination throughout the sequence. To ensure temporal coherence and prevent artifacts, we introduce a gated cross-attention mechanism for smooth feature blending and a temporal bootstrapping strategy that harnesses SVD's powerful motion priors. Although trained on synthetic data, ReLumix shows competitive generalization to real-world videos. The method demonstrates significant improvements in visual fidelity, offering a scalable and versatile solution for dynamic lighting control.",

Recent studies have proposed leveraging sparse gradients as a form of regularization to enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. In this work, we present a surprising finding: under specific architectural configurations, SNNs exhibit natural gradient sparsity and can achieve state-of-the-art adversarial defense performance without the need for any explicit regularization. Further analysis reveals a trade-off between robustness and generalization: while sparse gradients contribute to improved adversarial resilience, they can impair the model's ability to generalize; conversely, denser gradients support better generalization but increase vulnerability to attacks.",

To address the above challenges, in this paper, we introduce Diff-3DCap, which employs a sequence of projected views to represent a 3D object and a continuous diffusion model to facilitate the captioning process. More precisely, our approach utilizes the continuous diffusion model to perturb the embedded captions during the forward phase by introducing Gaussian noise and then predicts the reconstructed annotation during the reverse phase. Embedded within the diffusion framework is a commitment to leveraging a visual embedding obtained from a pre-trained visual-language model, which naturally allows the embedding to serve as a guiding signal, eliminating the need for an additional classifier. Extensive results of our experiments indicate that Diff-3DCap can achieve performance comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art methods.",

To address the challenge of lacking control in 3D point cloud generation, we are the first to propose controlling the generation of point clouds by shape structures that comprise part existences and part adjacency relationships. We manually annotate the adjacency relationships between the segmented parts of point cloud shapes, thereby constructing a StructureGraph representation. Based on this StructureGraph representation, we introduce StrucADT, a novel structure-controllable point cloud generation model, which consists of StructureGraphNet module to extract structure-aware latent features, cCNF Prior module to learn the distribution of the latent features controlled by the part adjacency, and Diffusion Transformer module conditioned on the latent features and part adjacency to generate structure-consistent point cloud shapes. Experimental results demonstrate that our structure-controllable 3D point cloud generation method produces high-quality and diverse point cloud shapes, enabling the generation of controllable point clouds based on user-specified shape structures and achieving state-of-the-art performance in controllable point cloud generation on the ShapeNet dataset.",

This limitation leads to inefficient representation and suboptimal reconstruction, especially in areas with fine-grained details or structural discontinuities.

However, these methods usually involve a large number of parameters and require high computational cost, which is unacceptable in many applications where speech separation serves as only a preprocessing step for further speech processing. To address this issue, we propose an efficient AVSS method, named Dolphin. For visual feature extraction, we develop DP-LipCoder, a dual-path lightweight video encoder that transforms lip-motion into discrete audio-aligned semantic tokens. For audio separation, we construct a lightweight encoder-decoder separator, in which each layer incorporates a global-local attention (GLA) block to efficiently capture multi-scale dependencies. Experiments on three benchmark datasets showed that Dolphin not only surpassed the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) model in separation quality but also achieved remarkable improvements in efficiency: over 50% fewer parameters, more than 2.4x reduction in MACs, and over 6x faster GPU inference speed.

In this paper, we propose a novel system ZeroScene, which leverages the prior knowledge of large vision models to accomplish both single image-to-3D scene reconstruction and texture editing in a zero-shot manner. ZeroScene extracts object-level 2D segmentation and depth information from input images to infer spatial relationships within the scene. It then jointly optimizes 3D and 2D projection losses of the point cloud to update object poses for precise scene alignment, ultimately constructing a coherent and complete 3D scene that encompasses both foreground and background. Moreover, ZeroScene supports texture editing of objects in the scene. By imposing constraints on the diffusion model and introducing a mask-guided progressive image generation strategy, we effectively maintain texture consistency across multiple viewpoints and further enhance the realism of rendered results through Physically Based Rendering (PBR) material estimation. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework not only ensures the geometric and appearance accuracy of generated assets, but also faithfully reconstructs scene layouts and produces highly detailed textures that closely align with text prompts.",

To address this, we introduce BridgeDrive, a novel anchor-guided diffusion bridge policy for closed-loop trajectory planning. Our approach provides a principled diffusion framework that effectively translates anchors into fine-grained trajectory plans, appropriately responding to varying traffic conditions. Our planner is compatible with efficient ODE solvers, a critical factor for real-time autonomous driving deployment. We achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Bench2Drive benchmark, improving the success rate by 5% over prior arts.",

Previous methods for compound lens design use gradient-based optimization to update continuous parameters (e.g., curvature of individual lens elements) of a given lens topology, requiring extensive expert intervention to realize topology changes. By contrast, our method can additionally optimize discrete parameters such as number and type (e.g., singlet or doublet) of lens elements. Our method achieves this capability by combining gradient-based optimization with a tailored Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling algorithm, using transdimensional mutation and paraxial projection operations for efficient global exploration. We show experimentally on a variety of lens design tasks that our method effectively explores an expanded design space of compound lenses, producing better designs than previous methods and pushing the envelope of speed-sharpness tradeoffs achievable by automated lens design.",

Recent advances in semantic navigation have demonstrated open-set object-goal navigation in indoor settings, but these methods remain limited by constrained spatial ranges and structured layouts, making them unsuitable for long-range outdoor search. While outdoor semantic navigation approaches exist, they either rely on reactive policies based on current observations, which tend to produce short-sighted behaviors, or precompute scene graphs offline for navigation, limiting adaptability to online deployment. We present RAVEN, a 3D memory-based, behavior tree framework for aerial semantic navigation in unstructured outdoor environments. It (1) uses a spatially consistent semantic voxel-ray map as persistent memory, enabling long-horizon planning and avoiding purely reactive behaviors, (2) combines short-range voxel search and long-range ray search to scale to large environments, (3) leverages a large vision-language model to suggest auxiliary cues, mitigating sparsity of outdoor targets. These components are coordinated by a behavior tree, which adaptively switches behaviors for robust operation. We evaluate RAVEN in 10 photorealistic outdoor simulation environments over 100 semantic tasks, encompassing single-object search, multi-class, multi-instance navigation and sequential task changes. Results show RAVEN outperforms baselines by 85.25% in simulation and demonstrate its real-world applicability through deployment on an aerial robot in outdoor field tests.",

        "summary": "Convolutional Neural Networks have become a cornerstone of medical image analysis due to their proficiency in learning hierarchical spatial features. However, this focus on a single domain is inefficient at capturing global, holistic patterns and fails to explicitly model an image's frequency-domain characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose the Spatial-Spectral Summarizer Fusion Network (S$^3$F-Net), a dual-branch framework that learns from both spatial and spectral representations simultaneously. The S$^3$F-Net performs a fusion of a deep spatial CNN with our proposed shallow spectral encoder, SpectraNet. SpectraNet features the proposed SpectralFilter layer, which leverages the Convolution Theorem by applying a bank of learnable filters directly to an image's full Fourier spectrum via a computation-efficient element-wise multiplication. This allows the SpectralFilter layer to attain a global receptive field instantaneously, with its output being distilled by a lightweight summarizer network. We evaluate S$^3$F-Net across four medical imaging datasets spanning different modalities to validate its efficacy and generalizability. Our framework consistently and significantly outperforms its strong spatial-only baseline in all cases, with accuracy improvements of up to 5.13%. With a powerful Bilinear Fusion, S$^3$F-Net achieves a SOTA competitive accuracy of 98.76% on the BRISC2025 dataset. Concatenation Fusion performs better on the texture-dominant Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset, achieving 93.11% accuracy, surpassing many top-performing, much deeper models. Our explainability analysis also reveals that the S$^3$F-Net learns to dynamically adjust its reliance on each branch based on the input pathology. These results verify that our dual-domain approach is a powerful and generalizable paradigm for medical image analysis.",

        "summary": "We propose Graph Consistency Regularization (GCR), a novel framework that injects relational graph structures, derived from model predictions, into the learning process to promote class-aware, semantically meaningful feature representations. Functioning as a form of self-prompting, GCR enables the model to refine its internal structure using its own outputs. While deep networks learn rich representations, these often capture noisy inter-class similarities that contradict the model's predicted semantics. GCR addresses this issue by introducing parameter-free Graph Consistency Layers (GCLs) at arbitrary depths. Each GCL builds a batch-level feature similarity graph and aligns it with a global, class-aware masked prediction graph, derived by modulating softmax prediction similarities with intra-class indicators. This alignment enforces that feature-level relationships reflect class-consistent prediction behavior, acting as a semantic regularizer throughout the network. Unlike prior work, GCR introduces a multi-layer, cross-space graph alignment mechanism with adaptive weighting, where layer importance is learned from graph discrepancy magnitudes. This allows the model to prioritize semantically reliable layers and suppress noisy ones, enhancing feature quality without modifying the architecture or training procedure. GCR is model-agnostic, lightweight, and improves semantic structure across various networks and datasets. Experiments show that GCR promotes cleaner feature structure, stronger intra-class cohesion, and improved generalization, offering a new perspective on learning from prediction structure.

However, the geometric simplifications inherent in proxies result in a loss of fine color and geometric details, making it essential for textures to compensate for the loss. Preserving the rich texture information from the original dense architectural reconstructions remains a daunting task, particularly when working with unordered RGB photographs. We propose an automated method for generating realistic texture maps for architectural proxy models at the texel level from an unordered collection of registered photographs. Our approach establishes correspondences between texels on a UV map and pixels in the input images, with each texel's color computed as a weighted blend of associated pixel values. Using differentiable rendering, we optimize blending parameters to ensure photometric and perspective consistency, while maintaining seamless texture coherence. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method across diverse architectural models and varying photographic conditions, enabling the creation of high-quality textures that preserve visual fidelity and structural detail.",

However, with many models now achieving similar predictive accuracy, we need a stronger criterion. Here, we use small-scale adversarial probes to characterize the local representational geometry of many highly predictive ANN-based brain models. We report four key findings. First, we show that most contemporary ANN-based brain models are unexpectedly fragile. Despite high prediction scores, their response predictions are highly sensitive to small, imperceptible perturbations, revealing unreliable local coding directions. Second, we demonstrate that a model's sensitivity to adversarial probes can better discriminate between candidate neural encoding models than prediction accuracy alone. Third, we find that standard models rely on distinct local coding directions that do not transfer across model architectures. Finally, we show that adversarial probes from robustified models produce generalizable and semantically meaningful changes, suggesting that they capture the local coding dimensions of the visual system. Together, our work shows that local representational geometry provides a stronger criterion for brain model evaluation. We also provide empirical grounds for favoring robust models, whose more stable coding axes not only align better with neural selectivity but also generate concrete, testable predictions for future experiments.",

        "summary": "Fine-tuning pretrained models is a standard and effective workflow in modern machine learning. However, robust fine-tuning (RFT), which aims to simultaneously achieve adaptation to a downstream task and robustness to adversarial examples, remains challenging. Despite the abundance of non-robust pretrained models in open-source repositories, their potential for RFT is less understood. We address this knowledge gap by systematically examining RFT from such non-robust models. Our experiments reveal that fine-tuning non-robust models with a robust objective, even under small perturbations, can lead to poor performance, a phenomenon that we dub \\emph{suboptimal transfer}. In challenging scenarios (eg, difficult tasks, high perturbation), the resulting performance can be so low that it may be considered a transfer failure. We find that fine-tuning using a robust objective impedes task adaptation at the beginning of training and eventually prevents optimal transfer. However, we propose a novel heuristic, \\emph{Epsilon-Scheduling}, a schedule over perturbation strength used during training that promotes optimal transfer. Additionally, we introduce \\emph{expected robustness}, a metric that captures performance across a range of perturbations, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the accuracy-robustness trade-off for diverse models at test time. Extensive experiments on a wide range of configurations (six pretrained models and five datasets) show that \\emph{Epsilon-Scheduling} successfully prevents \\emph{suboptimal transfer} and consistently improves expected robustness.",

While PRMs have been extensively studied in text-based domains, their extension to Vision Language Models (VLMs) remains limited. Existing Vision-Language PRMs (VL-PRMs) rely on Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for data construction, which can often produce noisy supervision signals and limit generalization across tasks. In this work, we aim to elucidate the design space of VL-PRMs by exploring diverse strategies for dataset construction, training, and test-time scaling. First, we introduce a hybrid data synthesis framework that combines MCTS with judgments from a strong VLM, producing more accurate step-level labels. Second, we propose perception-focused supervision, enabling our PRM to explicitly detect errors at the visual grounding stage of reasoning. Third, we systematically evaluate multiple test-time scaling strategies, showing that our PRMs can reliably guide VLMs toward more accurate solutions. Our experiments covering five diverse multimodal benchmarks (MMMU, PuzzleVQA, AlgoPuzzleVQA, MathVista, and MathVision) reveal several key insights: (i) VL-PRMs when used as Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) during test-time scaling (TTS) can outperform VL-PRM guided process step selection, (ii) smaller VL-PRMs can match or even surpass larger ones in detecting process errors, (iii) VL-PRMs uncover latent reasoning abilities in stronger VLM backbones, (iv) perception-level supervision leads to significant gains in test-time scaling, and (v) TTS performance of different policies improve on advanced math reasoning datasets despite not training VL-PRMs on such datasets.

We introduce Asynchronous Action Chunk Correction (A2C2), which is a lightweight real-time chunk correction head that runs every control step and adds a time-aware correction to any off-the-shelf VLA's action chunk. The module combines the latest observation, the predicted action from VLA (base action), a positional feature that encodes the index of the base action within the chunk, and some features from the base policy, then outputs a per-step correction. This preserves the base model's competence while restoring closed-loop responsiveness. The approach requires no retraining of the base policy and is orthogonal to asynchronous execution schemes such as Real Time Chunking (RTC). On the dynamic Kinetix task suite (12 tasks) and LIBERO Spatial, our method yields consistent success rate improvements across increasing delays and execution horizons (+23% point and +7% point respectively, compared to RTC), and also improves robustness for long horizons even with zero injected delay. Since the correction head is small and fast, there is minimal overhead compared to the inference of large VLA models. These results indicate that A2C2 is an effective, plug-in mechanism for deploying high-capacity chunking policies in real-time control.",

        "summary": "A fundamental reason for the dominance of attention over RNNs and LSTMs in LLMs is its ability to capture long-range dependencies by modeling direct interactions between all tokens, overcoming the sequential limitations of recurrent architectures. Similarly, a key reason why today's vision language models (VLMs) hallucinate and underperform pure language models is that they rely on direct concatenation of image and text tokens with a modality-blinded positional encoding, which conveniently adopts the pretrained LLM backbone but forces unnecessary long-distance attention between semantically related tokens across modalities. This underscores the urgent need for mechanisms that efficiently enhance token locality and cross-modal alignment. In response, we propose Attention Anchor, a parameter-free framework that efficiently groups semantically similar tokens across modalities, improving cross-modal locality. By inserting text tokens near relevant visual patches, we create semantic signposts that reveal true content-based cross-modal attention scores, guiding the model to focus on the correct image regions for tasks such as VQA, MMBench and POPE. This improves answer accuracy and reduces hallucinations without disrupting the prompt's semantic flow. AttAnchor achieves improvements across 13 out of 15 different metrics and benchmarks, including up to 32% gains on reasoning tasks and up to 15% improvements on hallucination benchmarks. AttAnchor enables TinyLLaVA 1B to outperform much larger models like LLaVA 7B and QwenVL 3B on POPE with only 0.1% inference time overhead. To the best of our knowledge, this work is among the first to investigate mixed-modal token grouping, where text and image tokens are clustered jointly into shared groups rather than being grouped within a single modality or merely aligned post-hoc with additional alignment losses.",

Due to co-adaptation between encoder and head guided by contrastive loss and monotonicity constraints, MonoCon learns robust, disentangled, and highly compact embeddings at a practically negligible performance cost. On the CIFAR-100 image classification task, MonoCon yields representations that are nearly 9x more compact and 1.5x more robust than the fine-tuned encoder baseline, while retaining 99\\% of the baseline's 5-NN classification accuracy. We also report a 3.4x more compact and 1.4x more robust representation on an SNLI sentence similarity task for a marginal reduction in the STSb score, establishing MonoCon as a general domain-agnostic framework. Crucially, these robust, ultra-compact representations learned via functional constraints offer a unified solution to critical challenges in disparate contexts ranging from edge computing to cloud-scale retrieval.",

        "summary": "Autonomous driving remains a highly active research domain that seeks to enable vehicles to perceive dynamic environments, predict the future trajectories of traffic agents such as vehicles, pedestrians, and cyclists and plan safe and efficient future motions. To advance the field, several competitive platforms and benchmarks have been established to provide standardized datasets and evaluation protocols. Among these, leaderboards by the CARLA organization and nuPlan and the Waymo Open Dataset have become leading benchmarks for assessing motion planning algorithms. Each offers a unique dataset and challenging planning problems spanning a wide range of driving scenarios and conditions. In this study, we present a comprehensive comparative analysis of the motion planning methods featured on these three leaderboards. To ensure a fair and unified evaluation, we adopt CARLA leaderboard v2.0 as our common evaluation platform and modify the selected models for compatibility. By highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches, we identify prevailing trends, common challenges, and suggest potential directions for advancing motion planning research.",

Although improvements can be achieved in particular domains, they struggle to develop general reasoning capabilities. Inspired by this, we propose a novel adaptive reasoning paradigm, Mixture-of-Visual-Thoughts (MoVT), which unifies different reasoning modes within a single model and guides it to select the appropriate mode based on context. To achieve this, we introduce AdaVaR, a two-stage Adaptive Visual Reasoning learning framework: different modes are unified and learned during the supervised cold-start stage, and the mode selection capability is induced via an RL process with a carefully designed AdaGRPO algorithm. Extensive experiments show that AdaVaR effectively guides the model to learn and differentiate multiple modes and perform context-adaptive mode selection, achieving consistent improvement across various scenarios, highlighting MoVT as an effective solution for building general visual reasoning models.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models have found extensive use in solving numerous inverse problems. Such diffusion inverse problem solvers aim to sample from the posterior distribution of data given the measurements, using a combination of the unconditional score function and an approximation of the posterior related to the forward process. Recently, consistency models (CMs) have been proposed to directly predict the final output from any point on the diffusion ODE trajectory, enabling high-quality sampling in just a few NFEs. CMs have also been utilized for inverse problems, but existing CM-based solvers either require additional task-specific training or utilize data fidelity operations with slow convergence, not amenable to large-scale problems. In this work, we reinterpret CMs as proximal operators of a prior, enabling their integration into plug-and-play (PnP) frameworks. We propose a solver based on PnP-ADMM, which enables us to leverage the fast convergence of conjugate gradient method. We further accelerate this with noise injection and momentum, dubbed PnP-CM, and show it maintains the convergence properties of the baseline PnP-ADMM. We evaluate our approach on a variety of inverse problems, including inpainting, super-resolution, Gaussian deblurring, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first CM trained for MRI datasets. Our results show that PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs, and can produce meaningful results in 2 steps, highlighting its effectiveness in real-world inverse problems while outperforming comparable CM-based approaches.",

        "summary": "Recent works have shown that deep learning based skin lesion image classification models trained on unbalanced dataset can exhibit bias toward protected demographic attributes such as race, age,and gender. Current bias mitigation methods usually either achieve high level of fairness with the degradation of accuracy, or only improve the model fairness on a single attribute. Additionally usually most bias mitigation strategies are either pre hoc through data processing or post hoc through fairness evaluation, instead of being integrated into the model learning itself. To solve these existing drawbacks, we propose a new Individual Typology Angle (ITA) Loss-based skin tone normalization and data augmentation method that directly feeds into an adaptable meta learning-based joint channel pruning framework. In skin tone normalization, ITA is used to estimate skin tone type and adjust automatically to target tones for dataset balancing. In the joint channel pruning framework, two nested optimization loops are used to find critical channels.The inner optimization loop finds and prunes the local critical channels by weighted soft nearest neighbor loss, and the outer optimization loop updates the weight of each attribute using group wise variance loss on meta-set. Experiments conducted in the ISIC2019 dataset validate the effectiveness of our method in simultaneously improving the fairness of the model on multiple sensitive attributes without significant degradation of accuracy. Finally, although the pruning mechanism adds some computational cost during training phase, usually training is done off line. More importantly,",

By introducing a binary mask to constrain noise to specific regions, localized attacks achieve significantly lower mean pixel perturbations, higher Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratios (PSNR), and improved Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) compared to global attacks. However, these benefits come at the cost of increased computational effort and a modest reduction in Attack Success Rate (ASR). Our results highlight that iterative methods, such as PGD and C&W, are more robust to localization constraints than single-step methods like FGSM, maintaining higher ASR and imperceptibility metrics.

Inspired by the inference efficiency of rectified flows, we introduce the rectification to the SE(3)-diffusion models and propose the ReSeFlow, i.e., Rectifying SE(3)-Equivariant Policy Learning Flows, providing fast, geodesic-consistent, least-computational policy generation. Crucially, both components employ SE(3)-equivariant networks to preserve rotational and translational symmetry, enabling robust generalization under rigid-body motions. With the verification on the simulated benchmarks, we find that the proposed ReSeFlow with only one inference step can achieve better performance with lower geodesic distance than the baseline methods, achieving up to a 48.5% error reduction on the painting task and a 21.9% reduction on the rotating triangle task compared to the baseline's 100-step inference. This method takes advantages of both SE(3) equivariance and rectified flow and puts it forward for the real-world application of generative policy learning models with the data and inference efficiency.",

Recent work has improved this through added complexity, such as larger models, exotic network architectures, and more complex algorithms, which are typically motivated purely by empirical performance.

Using the eigenspectrum and condition number of the critic's Hessian, we systematically investigate the impact of common architectural design decisions on training dynamics. Our analysis reveals that a novel combination of batch normalization (BN), weight normalization (WN), and a distributional cross-entropy (CE) loss produces condition numbers orders of magnitude smaller than baselines. This combination also naturally bounds gradient norms, a property critical for maintaining a stable effective learning rate under non-stationary targets and bootstrapping. Based on these insights, we introduce XQC: a well-motivated, sample-efficient deep actor-critic algorithm built upon soft actor-critic that embodies these optimization-aware principles. We achieve state-of-the-art sample efficiency across 55 proprioception and 15 vision-based continuous control tasks, all while using significantly fewer parameters than competing methods.",

To overcome this challenge, we introduce TRee Search Guided TRajectory-Aware Fine-Tuning for Discrete Diffusion (TR2-D2), a novel framework that optimizes reward-guided discrete diffusion trajectories with tree search to construct replay buffers for trajectory-aware fine-tuning. These buffers are generated using Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and subsequently used to fine-tune a pre-trained discrete diffusion model under a stochastic optimal control objective.

To remove this bottleneck, we introduce GLASS Flows, a new sampling paradigm that simulates a \"flow matching model within a flow matching model\" to sample Markov transitions. As we show in this work, this \"inner\" flow matching model can be retrieved from a pre-trained model without any re-training, combining the efficiency of ODEs with the stochastic evolution of SDEs. On large-scale text-to-image models, we show that GLASS Flows eliminate the trade-off between stochastic evolution and efficiency.

        "summary": "Generative models excel at synthesizing high-fidelity samples from complex data distributions, but they often violate hard constraints arising from physical laws or task specifications. A common remedy is to project intermediate samples onto the feasible set; however, repeated projection can distort the learned distribution and induce a mismatch with the data manifold. Thus, recent multi-stage procedures attempt to defer projection to clean samples during sampling, but they increase algorithmic complexity and accumulate errors across steps. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel training-free method, Chance-constrained Flow Matching (CCFM), that integrates stochastic optimization into the sampling process, enabling effective enforcement of hard constraints while maintaining high-fidelity sample generation. Importantly, CCFM guarantees feasibility in the same manner as conventional repeated projection, yet, despite operating directly on noisy intermediate samples, it is theoretically equivalent to projecting onto the feasible set defined by clean samples. This yields a sampler that mitigates distributional distortion. Empirical experiments show that CCFM outperforms current state-of-the-art constrained generative models in modeling complex physical systems governed by partial differential equations and molecular docking problems, delivering higher feasibility and fidelity.",

We address these questions theoretically in a sparse-token classification model in which positive samples embed a weak signal vector in a randomly chosen subset of tokens, whereas negative samples are pure noise. In the long-sequence limit, we show that a simple single-layer attention classifier can in principle achieve vanishing test error when the signal strength grows only logarithmically in the sequence length $L$, whereas linear classifiers require $\\sqrt{L}$ scaling. Moving from representational power to learnability, we study training at finite $L$ in a high-dimensional regime, where sample size and embedding dimension grow proportionally. We prove that just two gradient updates suffice for the query weight vector of the attention classifier to acquire a nontrivial alignment with the hidden signal, inducing an attention map that selectively amplifies informative tokens. We further derive an exact asymptotic expression for the test error and training loss of the trained attention-based classifier, and quantify its capacity -- the largest dataset size that is typically perfectly separable -- thereby explaining the advantage of adaptive token selection over nonadaptive linear baselines.",

Together, these components form BALF, an efficient pipeline for compressing models without fine-tuning. We demonstrate its effectiveness across multiple scales and architectures, from ResNet-20 on CIFAR-10 to ResNeXt-101 and vision transformers on ImageNet, and show that it achieves excellent results in the fine-tuning-free regime. For instance, BALF reduces FLOPs on ResNeXt-101 by 45% with only a 1-percentage-point top-1 accuracy drop.",

        "summary": "As machine learning systems increasingly train on self-annotated data, they risk reinforcing errors and becoming echo chambers of their own beliefs. We model this phenomenon by introducing a learning-theoretic framework: Online Learning in the Replay Setting. In round $t$, the learner outputs a hypothesis $\\hat{h}_t$; the adversary then reveals either the true label $f^\\ast(x_t)$ or a replayed label $\\hat{h}_i(x_t)$ from an earlier round $i < t$. A mistake is counted only when the true label is shown, yet classical algorithms such as the SOA or the halving algorithm are easily misled by the replayed errors. We introduce the Extended Threshold dimension, $\\mathrm{ExThD}(\\mathcal{H})$, and prove matching upper and lower bounds that make $\\mathrm{ExThD}(\\mathcal{H})$ the exact measure of learnability in this model. A closure-based learner makes at most $\\mathrm{ExThD}(\\mathcal{H})$ mistakes against any adaptive adversary, and no algorithm can perform better. For stochastic adversaries, we prove a similar bound for every intersection-closed class. The replay setting is provably harder than the classical mistake bound setting: some classes have constant Littlestone dimension but arbitrarily large $\\mathrm{ExThD}(\\mathcal{H})$. Proper learning exhibits an even sharper separation: a class is properly learnable under replay if and only if it is (almost) intersection-closed. Otherwise, every proper learner suffers $\\Omega(T)$ errors, whereas our improper algorithm still achieves the $\\mathrm{ExThD}(\\mathcal{H})$ bound. These results give the first tight analysis of learning against replay adversaries, based on new results for closure-type algorithms.",

This probe-centric approach enables a single physics-informed neural network to reconstruct unseen experiments across multiple beamlines; among the first demonstrations of multi-probe generalization.

In contrast, recent RL approaches for diffusion models, most notably Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO), optimize an objective different from the pretraining objectives--score/flow matching loss. In this work, we establish a novel theoretical analysis: DDPO is an implicit form of score/flow matching with noisy targets, which increases variance and slows convergence. Building on this analysis, we introduce \\textbf{Advantage Weighted Matching (AWM)}, a policy-gradient method for diffusion. It uses the same score/flow-matching loss as pretraining to obtain a lower-variance objective and reweights each sample by its advantage. In effect, AWM raises the influence of high-reward samples and suppresses low-reward ones while keeping the modeling objective identical to pretraining. This unifies pretraining and RL conceptually and practically, is consistent with policy-gradient theory, reduces variance, and yields faster convergence. This simple yet effective design yields substantial benefits: on GenEval, OCR, and PickScore benchmarks, AWM delivers up to a $24\\times$ speedup over Flow-GRPO (which builds on DDPO), when applied to Stable Diffusion 3.5 Medium and FLUX, without compromising generation quality.

        "summary": "The current paradigm for reasoning in large language models (LLMs) involves models \"thinking out loud\" via a sequence of tokens, known as chain-of-thought (CoT). This approach, while effective, has several significant drawbacks. Firstly, inference requires autoregressive generation of often thousands of CoT tokens, which is slow and computationally expensive. Secondly, it constrains reasoning to the discrete space of tokens, creating an information bottleneck across reasoning steps. Thirdly, it fundamentally entangles reasoning with token generation, forcing LLMs to \"think while speaking,\" which causes potentially short-sighted reasoning. In light of these limitations, we re-imagine reasoning in LLMs and present a new paradigm: MARCOS. In our approach, rather than autoregressively generating tokens, we model reasoning as a hidden Markov chain of continuous, high-dimensional \"thoughts\". Each reasoning step involves a transition of the internal thoughts, where explicit reasoning steps (which may consist of hundreds of tokens) serve as observable variables, which are windows to peek into the implicit thoughts. Since this latent process is incompatible with the standard supervised learning, we further propose a two-phase variational training scheme. Our experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate that MARCOS outperforms existing continuous reasoning methods and, for the first time, achieves performance comparable to token-based CoT, even surpassing it by 4.7% on GSM8K with up to 15.7x speedup in inference. Beyond this, MARCOS offers additional advantages, such as step-level instead of token-level control over randomness, opening significant opportunities for reinforcement learning and reasoning in LLMs.",

We provide non-asymptotic, instance-adaptive guarantees whose rates depend on RKHS entropy, unifying tabular, linear, Sobolev, Gaussian, and Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) regimes, and we derive a sampling rule for the proximal update that ensures the optimal $k^{-1/2}$ convergence rate for stochastic optimization. Empirically, the theory-aligned schedule improves stability and sample efficiency on common control tasks (e.g., CartPole, Acrobot), while our TD-based critic attains favorable throughput versus a GAE baseline.

Current methods rely primarily on policy optimization frameworks like PPO and GRPO, which follow generalized policy iteration that alternates between evaluating the current policy's value and improving the policy based on evaluation. While effective, they often suffer from training instability and diversity collapse, requiring complex heuristic tricks and careful tuning. We observe that standard RLVR in math reasoning can be formalized as a specialized finite-horizon Markov Decision Process with deterministic state transitions, tree-structured dynamics, and binary terminal rewards. Though large in scale, the underlying structure is simpler than general-purpose control settings for which popular RL algorithms (e.g., PPO) were developed, suggesting that several sophisticated techniques in existing methods may be reduced or even omitted. Based on this insight, we prove a surprising result: the optimal action can be recovered from the Q-function of a fixed uniformly random policy, thereby bypassing the generalized policy iteration loop and its associated heuristics. We introduce Random Policy Valuation for Diverse Reasoning (ROVER) to translate this principle into a practical and scalable algorithm for LLM math reasoning, a minimalist yet highly effective RL method that samples actions from a softmax over these uniform-policy Q-values. ROVER preserves diversity throughout training, allowing sustained exploration of multiple valid pathways. Across multiple base models and standard math reasoning benchmarks, ROVER demonstrates superior performance in both \\textbf{quality} (\\textbf{+8.2} on pass@1, \\textbf{+16.8} on pass@256) and \\textbf{diversity} (\\textbf{+17.6\\%}), despite its radical simplification compared to strong, complicated existing methods.",

Specifically, we introduce Overlap-Adaptive Regularization (OAR) that regularizes target models proportionally to overlap weights so that, informally, the regularization is higher in regions with low overlap. To the best of our knowledge, our OAR is the first approach to leverage overlap weights in the regularization terms of the meta-learners. Our OAR approach is flexible and works with any existing CATE meta-learner: we demonstrate how OAR can be applied to both parametric and non-parametric second-stage models. Furthermore, we propose debiased versions of our OAR that preserve the Neyman-orthogonality of existing meta-learners and thus ensure more robust inference. Through a series of (semi-)synthetic experiments, we demonstrate that our OAR significantly improves CATE estimation in low-overlap settings in comparison to constant regularization.",

We present DUCHESS, an LLM serving system that reduces cost and latency without sacrificing accuracy through intra-request branch orchestration guided by predictions. DUCHESS employs a lightweight linear probing model over LLM layer activations to estimate branch correctness, and its orchestration policy decides whether to terminate, duplicate, or continue a branch. When handling multiple requests, DUCHESS further reduces latency by prioritizing easier reasoning tasks when complexity can be estimated from the prompt. Experiments on three reasoning benchmarks show that DUCHESS consistently improves the token-accuracy Pareto frontier, reducing token usage by 42-63% at matched accuracy compared to self-consistency. In serving with vLLM, DUCHESS reduces mean, median, and tail latencies by 57-81%, 58-85%, and 52-84% with First-Come-First-Served scheduling, and achieves additional gains under difficulty-aware scheduling at higher request rates.",

However, training deep RL models poses several challenges, such as the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning and high computational costs. Transfer learning has emerged as a promising strategy to address these challenges by enabling the reuse of knowledge from previously learned tasks for new, related tasks. This avoids the need for retraining models entirely from scratch. A commonly used approach for transfer learning in RL is to leverage the internal representations learned by the neural network during training. Specifically, the activations from the last hidden layer can be viewed as refined state representations that encapsulate the essential features of the input. In this work, we investigate whether these representations can be used as input for training simpler models, such as linear function approximators, on new tasks. We observe that the representations learned by standard deep RL models can be highly correlated, which limits their effectiveness when used with linear function approximation. To mitigate this problem, we propose a novel deep Q-learning approach that introduces a regularization term to reduce positive correlations between feature representation of states. By leveraging these reduced correlated features, we enable more effective use of linear function approximation in transfer learning. Through experiments and ablation studies on standard RL benchmarks and MinAtar games, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach in improving transfer learning performance and thereby reducing computational overhead.",

Accordingly, instead of enforcing constant velocity, OAT-FM optimizes the acceleration transport in the product space of sample and velocity, whose objective corresponds to a necessary and sufficient condition of flow straightness. An efficient algorithm is designed to achieve OAT-FM with low complexity. OAT-FM motivates a new two-phase FM paradigm: Given a generative model trained by an arbitrary FM method, whose velocity information has been relatively reliable, we can fine-tune and improve it via OAT-FM. This paradigm eliminates the risk of data distribution drift and the need to generate a large number of noise data pairs, which consistently improves model performance in various generative tasks.

        "summary": "Bayesian optimization is a natural candidate for the engineering of antibody therapeutic properties, which is often iterative and expensive. However, finding the optimal choice of surrogate model for optimization over the highly structured antibody space is difficult, and may differ depending on the property being optimized. Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, no prior works have attempted to incorporate structural information into antibody Bayesian optimization. In this work, we explore different approaches to incorporating structural information into Bayesian optimization, and compare them to a variety of sequence-only approaches on two different antibody properties, binding affinity and stability. In addition, we propose the use of a protein language model-based ``soft constraint,'' which helps guide the optimization to promising regions of the space. We find that certain types of structural information improve data efficiency in early optimization rounds for stability, but have equivalent peak performance. Moreover, when incorporating the protein language model soft constraint we find that the data efficiency gap is diminished for affinity and eliminated for stability, resulting in sequence-only methods that match the performance of structure-based methods, raising questions about the necessity of structure in Bayesian optimization for antibodies.",

        "summary": "While protein language models (PLMs) are one of the most promising avenues of research for future de novo protein design, the way in which they transform sequences to hidden representations, as well as the information encoded in such representations is yet to be fully understood. Several works have attempted to propose interpretability tools for PLMs, but they have focused on understanding how individual sequences are transformed by such models. Therefore, the way in which PLMs transform the whole space of sequences along with their relations is still unknown. In this work we attempt to understand this transformed space of sequences by identifying protein structure and representation with square-root velocity (SRV) representations and graph filtrations. Both approaches naturally lead to a metric space in which pairs of proteins or protein representations can be compared with each other. We analyze different types of proteins from the SCOP dataset and show that the Karcher mean and effective dimension of the SRV shape space follow a non-linear pattern as a function of the layers in ESM2 models of different sizes. Furthermore, we use graph filtrations as a tool to study the context lengths at which models encode the structural features of proteins. We find that PLMs preferentially encode immediate as well as local relations between residues, but start to degrade for larger context lengths. The most structurally faithful encoding tends to occur close to, but before the last layer of the models, indicating that training a folding model ontop of these layers might lead to improved folding performance.",

        "summary": "Canonicalization is a widely used strategy in equivariant machine learning, enforcing symmetry in neural networks by mapping each input to a standard form. Yet, it often introduces discontinuities that can affect stability during training, limit generalization, and complicate universal approximation theorems. In this paper, we address this by introducing \\emph{adaptive canonicalization}, a general framework in which the canonicalization depends both on the input and the network. Specifically, we present the adaptive canonicalization based on prior maximization, where the standard form of the input is chosen to maximize the predictive confidence of the network. We prove that this construction yields continuous and symmetry-respecting models that admit universal approximation properties. We propose two applications of our setting: (i) resolving eigenbasis ambiguities in spectral graph neural networks, and (ii) handling rotational symmetries in point clouds. We empirically validate our methods on molecular and protein classification, as well as point cloud classification tasks. Our adaptive canonicalization outperforms the three other common solutions to equivariant machine learning: data augmentation, standard canonicalization, and equivariant architectures.",

Furthermore, we establish a precise link between these regimes and the spectral properties of the trained network weights, which we characterize in detail.

Reliably calibrated model uncertainties, hence, enable more effective collaboration, targeted expert intervention and more responsible usage of Machine Learning (ML) systems. Conformal prediction has become a well established model-agnostic framework for uncertainty calibration of ML models, offering statistically valid confidence estimates for both regression and classification tasks. In this work, we apply conformal prediction to $\\textit{SoilNet}$, a multimodal multitask model for describing soil profiles. We design a simulated human-in-the-loop (HIL) annotation pipeline, where a limited budget for obtaining ground truth annotations from domain experts is available when model uncertainty is high. Our experiments show that conformalizing SoilNet leads to more efficient annotation in regression tasks and comparable performance scores in classification tasks under the same annotation budget when tested against its non-conformal counterpart.

        "summary": "Learning PDE dynamics with neural solvers can significantly improve wall-clock efficiency and accuracy compared with classical numerical solvers. In recent years, foundation models for PDEs have largely adopted multi-scale windowed self-attention, with the scOT backbone in \\textsc{Poseidon} serving as a representative example. However, because of their locality, truly globally consistent spectral coupling can only be propagated gradually through deep stacking and window shifting. This weakens global coupling and leads to error accumulation and drift during closed-loop rollouts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{DRIFT-Net}. It employs a dual-branch design comprising a spectral branch and an image branch. The spectral branch is responsible for capturing global, large-scale low-frequency information, whereas the image branch focuses on local details and nonstationary structures. Specifically, we first perform controlled, lightweight mixing within the low-frequency range. Then we fuse the spectral and image paths at each layer via bandwise weighting, which avoids the width inflation and training instability caused by naive concatenation. The fused result is transformed back into the spatial domain and added to the image branch, thereby preserving both global structure and high-frequency details across scales. Compared with strong attention-based baselines, DRIFT-Net achieves lower error and higher throughput with fewer parameters under identical training settings and budget. On Navier--Stokes benchmarks, the relative $L_{1}$ error is reduced by 7\\%--54\\%, the parameter count decreases by about 15\\%, and the throughput remains higher than scOT. Ablation studies and theoretical analyses further demonstrate the stability and effectiveness of this design. The code is available at https://github.com/cruiseresearchgroup/DRIFT-Net.",

The analysis revealed that popularity was by far the most decisive predictor of Billboard Hot 100 inclusion, with considerable contribution from instrumentalness, valence, duration and speechiness.

Recently, single-cell foundation models have emerged as powerful tools for learning transferable representations directly from expression profiles, improving performance on classification and clustering tasks. However, these models are limited to discrete prediction heads, which collapse cellular complexity into predefined labels that fail to capture the richer, contextual explanations biologists need. We introduce Cell2Text, a multimodal generative framework that translates scRNA-seq profiles into structured natural language descriptions. By integrating gene-level embeddings from single-cell foundation models with pretrained large language models, Cell2Text generates coherent summaries that capture cellular identity, tissue origin, disease associations, and pathway activity, generalizing to unseen cells. Empirically, Cell2Text outperforms baselines on classification accuracy, demonstrates strong ontological consistency using PageRank-based similarity metrics, and achieves high semantic fidelity in text generation. These results demonstrate that coupling expression data with natural language offers both stronger predictive performance and inherently interpretable outputs, pointing to a scalable path for label-efficient characterization of unseen cells.",

Model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) mitigates this by building world models that simulate environmental dynamics and generate synthetic experience, improving sample efficiency. However, conventional world models process observations holistically, failing to decouple dynamic objects and temporal features from static backgrounds. This approach is computationally inefficient, especially for visual tasks where dynamic objects significantly influence rewards and decision-making performance. To address this, we introduce DyMoDreamer, a novel MBRL algorithm that incorporates a dynamic modulation mechanism to improve the extraction of dynamic features and enrich the temporal information. DyMoDreamer employs differential observations derived from a novel inter-frame differencing mask, explicitly encoding object-level motion cues and temporal dynamics. Dynamic modulation is modeled as stochastic categorical distributions and integrated into a recurrent state-space model (RSSM), enhancing the model's focus on reward-relevant dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that DyMoDreamer sets a new state-of-the-art on the Atari $100$k benchmark with a $156.6$\\% mean human-normalized score, establishes a new record of $832$ on the DeepMind Visual Control Suite, and gains a $9.5$\\% performance improvement after $1$M steps on the Crafter benchmark.

We propose the Hybrid Decomposition Dual-Stream Adaptive Transformer (DSAT-HD), which integrates three key innovations to address the limitations of existing methods: 1) A hybrid decomposition mechanism combining EMA and Fourier decomposition with RevIN normalization, dynamically balancing seasonal and trend components through noise Top-k gating; 2) A multi-scale adaptive pathway leveraging a sparse allocator to route features to four parallel Transformer layers, followed by feature merging via a sparse combiner, enhanced by hybrid attention combining local CNNs and global interactions; 3) A dual-stream residual learning framework where CNN and MLP branches separately process seasonal and trend components, coordinated by a balanced loss function minimizing expert collaboration variance.

However, the weather dependency of these energy sources poses a challenge to grid stability, with so-called Dunkelflaute events -- periods of low wind and solar power generation -- being of particular concern due to their potential to cause electricity supply shortages. In this study, we investigate the impact of these events on the German electricity production in the years and decades to come. For this purpose, we adapt a recently developed generative deep learning framework to downscale climate simulations from the CMIP6 ensemble. We first compare their statistics to the historical record taken from ERA5 data. Next, we use these downscaled simulations to assess plausible future occurrences of Dunkelflaute events in Germany under the optimistic low (SSP2-4.5) and high (SSP5-8.5) emission scenarios. Our analysis indicates that both the frequency and duration of Dunkelflaute events in Germany in the ensemble mean are projected to remain largely unchanged compared to the historical period. This suggests that, under the considered climate scenarios, the associated risk is expected to remain stable throughout the century.",

We introduce a new class of generative models, MSM Emulators, which instead learn to sample transitions across discrete states defined by an underlying Markov State Model (MSM). We instantiate this class with Markov Space Flow Matching (MarS-FM), whose sampling offers more than two orders of magnitude speedup compared to implicit- or explicit-solvent MD simulations. We benchmark Mars-FM ability to reproduce MD statistics through structural observables such as RMSD, radius of gyration, and secondary structure content. Our evaluation spans protein domains (up to 500 residues) with significant chemical and structural diversity, including unfolding events, and enforces strict sequence dissimilarity between training and test sets to assess generalization.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate incorrect or unsupported content, known as hallucinations. Existing detection methods rely on heuristics or simple models over isolated computational traces such as activations, or attention maps. We unify these signals by representing them as attributed graphs, where tokens are nodes, edges follow attentional flows, and both carry features from attention scores and activations. Our approach, CHARM, casts hallucination detection as a graph learning task and tackles it by applying GNNs over the above attributed graphs. We show that CHARM provably subsumes prior attention-based heuristics and, experimentally, it consistently outperforms other leading approaches across diverse benchmarks. Our results shed light on the relevant role played by the graph structure and on the benefits of combining computational traces, whilst showing CHARM exhibits promising zero-shot performance on cross-dataset transfer.",

Current neural network approaches to MTPP inference rely on training separate, specialized models for each target system. We pursue a radically different approach: drawing on amortized inference and in-context learning, we pretrain a deep neural network to infer, in-context, the conditional intensity functions of event histories from a context defined by sets of event sequences. Pretraining is performed on a large synthetic dataset of MTPPs sampled from a broad distribution of Hawkes processes. Once pretrained, our Foundation Inference Model for Point Processes (FIM-PP) can estimate MTPPs from real-world data without any additional training, or be rapidly finetuned to target systems. Experiments show that this amortized approach matches the performance of specialized models on next-event prediction across common benchmark datasets. Our pretrained model, repository and tutorials will soon be available online",

        "summary": "Pretraining a policy on offline data followed by fine-tuning through online interactions, known as Offline-to-Online Reinforcement Learning (O2O RL), has emerged as a promising paradigm for real-world RL deployment. However, both offline datasets and online interactions in practical environments are often noisy or even maliciously corrupted, severely degrading the performance of O2O RL. Existing works primarily focus on mitigating the conservatism of offline policies via online exploration, while the robustness of O2O RL under data corruption, including states, actions, rewards, and dynamics, is still unexplored. In this work, we observe that data corruption induces heavy-tailed behavior in the policy, thereby substantially degrading the efficiency of online exploration. To address this issue, we incorporate Inverse Probability Weighted (IPW) into the online exploration policy to alleviate heavy-tailedness, and propose a novel, simple yet effective method termed $\\textbf{RPEX}$: $\\textbf{R}$obust $\\textbf{P}$olicy $\\textbf{EX}$pansion. Extensive experimental results on D4RL datasets demonstrate that RPEX achieves SOTA O2O performance across a wide range of data corruption scenarios.

Specifically, we: 1) revisit the ubiquitous $\\textit{softmax}$ function and demonstrate its limitations from an information-geometric perspective; 2) replace the $\\textit{softmax}$ with the $\\textit{catnat}$ function, a function composed of a sequence of hierarchical binary splits; we prove that this choice offers significant advantages to gradient descent due to the resulting diagonal Fisher Information Matrix. A rich set of experiments - including graph structure learning, variational autoencoders, and reinforcement learning - empirically show that the proposed function improves the learning efficiency and yields models characterized by consistently higher test performance. $\\textit{Catnat}$ is simple to implement and seamlessly integrates into existing codebases. Moreover, it remains compatible with standard training stabilization techniques and, as such, offers a better alternative to the $\\textit{softmax}$ function.",

        "summary": "Estimating queue lengths at signalized intersections remains a challenge in traffic management, especially under partially observed conditions where vehicle flows are not fully captured. This paper introduces Q-Net, a data-efficient and interpretable framework for queue length estimation that performs robustly even when traffic conservation assumptions are violated. Q-Net integrates two widely available and privacy-friendly data sources: (i) vehicle counts from loop detectors near stop lines, and (ii) aggregated floating car data (aFCD), which divides each road section into segments and provides segment-wise average speed measurements. These data sources often differ in spatial and temporal resolution, creating fusion challenges. Q-Net addresses this by employing a tailored state-space model and an AI-augmented Kalman filter, KalmanNet, which learns the Kalman gain from data without requiring prior knowledge of noise covariances or full system dynamics. We build on the vanilla KalmanNet pipeline to decouple measurement dimensionality from section length, enabling spatial transferability across road segments. Unlike black-box models, Q-Net maintains physical interpretability, with internal variables linked to real-world traffic dynamics. Evaluations on main roads in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, demonstrate that Q-Net outperforms baseline methods by over 60\\% in Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), accurately tracking queue formation and dissipation while correcting aFCD-induced delays. Q-Net also demonstrates strong spatial and temporal transferability, enabling deployment without costly sensing infrastructure like cameras or radar. Additionally, we propose a real-time variant of Q-Net, highlighting its potential for integration into dynamic, queue-based traffic control systems.",

Inspired by popular techniques in policy search, we propose a training framework for discrete VAEs that leverages the natural gradient of a non-parametric encoder to update the parametric encoder without requiring reparameterization. Our method, combined with automatic step size adaptation and a transformer-based encoder, scales to challenging datasets such as ImageNet and outperforms both approximate reparameterization methods and quantization-based discrete autoencoders in reconstructing high-dimensional data from compact latent spaces, achieving a 20% improvement on FID Score for ImageNet 256.",

However, real-world application is hindered by three major challenges: (1) the black-box nature of powerful proprietary LLMs, (2) the need for high sample efficiency due to query costs, and (3) the desire for privacy-preserving collaboration among multiple users. To address these challenges simultaneously, we introduce a novel framework for sample-efficient federated prompt optimization based on multi-armed bandits (MABs). The MAB framework is uniquely suited for this problem as it is (1) inherently a black-box optimization method, (2) practically sample-efficient, and (3) enables collaborative learning with theoretically guaranteed benefit from more participating agents. We first propose the Federated Prompt Optimization via Bandits (FedPOB) algorithm, a federated variant of the Linear UCB algorithm, where agents collaborate by sharing model parameters instead of raw data. We then extend our approach to the practical setting of comparative user feedback by introducing FedPOB with Preference Feedback (FedPOB-Pref), an efficient algorithm based on federated dueling bandits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both FedPOB and FedPOB-Pref significantly outperform existing baselines and that their performance consistently improves as more agents participate in the collaboration, validating the effectiveness of our federated approach.",

To address this challenge, we introduce a new paradigm for real-time personalization by learning from online pairwise preference feedback collected during text generation. We propose T-POP (Test-Time Personalization with Online Preference Feedback}), a novel algorithm that synergistically combines test-time alignment with dueling bandits. Without updating the LLM parameters, T-POP steers the decoding process of a frozen LLM by learning a reward function online that captures user preferences. By leveraging dueling bandits, T-POP intelligently queries the user to efficiently balance between exploring their preferences and exploiting the learned knowledge to generate personalized text. Extensive experiments demonstrate that T-POP achieves rapid and data-efficient personalization, significantly outperforming existing baselines and showing consistent improvement with more user interactions.",

We demonstrate empirically that this addition enables models to successfully perform out-of-distribution two-hop reasoning, a task they otherwise completely fail. To explain this phenomenon, we provide a theoretical analysis using a simplified Emb-MLP model, proving that identity supervision reshapes the model's latent geometry. We show this alignment is induced by an implicit nuclear-norm regularization during optimization, which favors low-rank solutions that share structure across tasks. For complex tasks, we use small initialization or weight decay to enhance the regularization effect, which enhances the latent space alignment effect and slows down the generalization decay. Finally, we extend our investigation to large-scale models, observing that they still achieve two-hop reasoning through the latent memory, which provides crucial inspiration for enhancing their implicit reasoning abilities.",

Appropriate model evaluation should carefully consider the context in which a model will be used, including the relative value of correct classifications of positive versus negative examples, which affects the threshold that should be used. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and cost curves are model evaluation approaches that assess the expected utility and expected loss of prediction models, respectively, across decision thresholds. We compared DCA and cost curves to determine how they are related, and their strengths and limitations. We demonstrate that decision curves are closely related to a specific type of cost curve called a Brier curve. Both curves are derived assuming model scores are calibrated and setting the classification threshold using the relative value of correct positive and negative classifications, and the x-axis of both curves are equivalent. Net benefit (used for DCA) and Brier loss (used for Brier curves) will always choose the same model as optimal at any given threshold. Across thresholds, differences in Brier loss are comparable whereas differences in net benefit cannot be compared. Brier curves are more generally applicable (when a wider range of thresholds are plausible), and the area under the Brier curve is the Brier score. We demonstrate that reference lines common in each space can be included in either and suggest the upper envelope decision curve as a useful comparison for DCA showing the possible gain in net benefit that could be achieved through recalibration alone.",

In this paper, we propose CURA, an architecture inspired by analog audio signal processing circuits that provides a compact and lightweight solution for diverse machine learning tasks across multiple domains. Our architecture offers three key advantages over existing approaches: (1) Compactness: it requires significantly fewer parameters regardless of task complexity; (2) Generalizability: it adapts seamlessly across regression, classification, complex NLP, and computer vision tasks; and (3) Complex pattern recognition: it can capture intricate data patterns while maintaining extremely low model complexity. We evaluated CURA across diverse datasets and domains. For compactness, it achieved equivalent accuracy using up to 2,500 times fewer parameters compared to baseline models. For generalizability, it demonstrated consistent performance across four NLP benchmarks and one computer vision dataset, nearly matching specialized existing models (achieving F1-scores up to 90%).

This coupling makes the problems computationally demanding, as it requires handling high dimensional discretization and dynamic constraints. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a learning-based framework that integrates a dynamic predictor with an optimization surrogate. The dynamic predictor, a novel time-discrete Neural Operator (Lu et al.), efficiently approximate system trajectories governed by PDE dynamics, while the optimization surrogate leverages proxy optimizer techniques (Kotary et al.) to approximate the associated optimal decisions. This dual-network design enables real-time approximation of optimal strategies while explicitly capturing the coupling between decisions and PDE dynamics. We validate the proposed approach on benchmark PDE-constrained optimization tasks inlacing Burgers' equation, heat equation and voltage regulation, and demonstrate that it achieves solution quality comparable to classical control-based algorithms, such as the Direct Method and Model Predictive Control (MPC), while providing up to four orders of magnitude improvement in computational speed.",

Specifically, we measure the difference between embeddings of sequential environment states and test whether this transition vector is recoverable from intermediate model activations. Using linear and non linear probes trained on activations across layers, we find statistically significant predictive ability on state transitions exceeding baselines (embeddings), indicating that OpenVLA encodes an internal world model (as opposed to the probes learning the state transitions).

        "summary": "This study showcases an experimental deployment of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for active flow control (AFC) of vortex-induced vibrations (VIV) in a circular cylinder at a high Reynolds number (Re = 3000) using rotary actuation. Departing from prior work that relied on low-Reynolds-number numerical simulations, this research demonstrates real-time control in a challenging experimental setting, successfully addressing practical constraints such as actuator delay. When the learning algorithm is provided with state feedback alone (displacement and velocity of the oscillating cylinder), the DRL agent learns a low-frequency rotary control strategy that achieves up to 80% vibration suppression which leverages the traditional lock-on phenomenon. While this level of suppression is significant, it remains below the performance achieved using high-frequency rotary actuation. The reduction in performance is attributed to actuation delays and can be mitigated by augmenting the learning algorithm with past control actions. This enables the agent to learn a high-frequency rotary control strategy that effectively modifies vortex shedding and achieves over 95% vibration attenuation. These results demonstrate the adaptability of DRL for AFC in real-world experiments and its ability to overcome instrumental limitations such as actuation lag.",

However, the impact of the window length and the interplay between softmax attention and linear RNN layers remain under-studied. In this work, we introduce SWAX, a hybrid architecture consisting of sliding-window attention and xLSTM linear RNN layers. A counter-intuitive finding with SWAX is that larger sliding windows do not improve the long-context performance. In fact, short window attention encourages the model to better train the long-term memory of the xLSTM, by relying less on the softmax attention mechanism for long context-retrieval. The issue with small sliding windows is that they are detrimental for short-context tasks, which could be solved with information from moderately larger sliding windows otherwise. Therefore, we train SWAX by stochastically changing the sliding window size, forcing the model to leverage both a longer context window and the xLSTM memory. SWAX trained with stochastic window sizes significantly outperforms regular window attention both on short and long-context problems.",

The proposed multimodal diffusion guidance (MDG) provides a lightweight, plug-and-play control signal that can be applied on top of any pretrained audio diffusion model without retraining.

We study a variety of models for spatio-temporal forecasting, a task governed by physical laws and well-suited for exploring different levels of physics inductive bias. We show that embedding physics inductive biases into the model design can yield substantial efficiency gains while retaining or even improving efficacy for the tasks under consideration. In addition to using standard physics-informed spatio-temporal models, we demonstrate the usefulness of more recent models like flow matching as a general purpose method for spatio-temporal forecasting. Our experiments show that incorporating physics inductive biases offer a principled way to improve the efficiency and reduce the carbon footprint of machine learning models.

Earlier explanations mostly focused on the observation that TTT may help when applied to out-of-distribution adaptation or used with privileged data. However, the growing scale of foundation models with most test data being in-distribution questions these explanations. We instead posit that foundation models remain globally underparameterized, with TTT providing a mechanism for specialization after generalization, focusing capacity on concepts relevant to the test task. Specifically, under the linear representation hypothesis, we propose a model in which TTT achieves a substantially smaller in-distribution test error than global training. We empirically validate our model's key assumptions by training a sparse autoencoder on ImageNet, showing that semantically related data points are explained by only a few shared concepts. Finally, we perform scaling studies across image and language tasks that confirm the practical implications of our model, identifying the regimes where specialization is most effective.",

Inspired by biological DNA, we address these limitations by mathematically defining LLM DNA as a low-dimensional, bi-Lipschitz representation of functional behavior. We prove that LLM DNA satisfies inheritance and genetic determinism properties and establish the existence of DNA. Building on this theory, we derive a general, scalable, training-free pipeline for DNA extraction. In experiments across 305 LLMs, DNA aligns with prior studies on limited subsets and achieves superior or competitive performance on specific tasks. Beyond these tasks, DNA comparisons uncover previously undocumented relationships among LLMs. We further construct the evolutionary tree of LLMs using phylogenetic algorithms, which align with shifts from encoder-decoder to decoder-only architectures, reflect temporal progression, and reveal distinct evolutionary speeds across LLM families.",

Existing post-hoc approaches that retrofit pretrained models either inherit misplaced confidence or merely reshape predictions, without teaching the model when to be uncertain. We introduce GUIDE, a lightweight evidential learning meta-model approach that attaches to a frozen deep learning model and explicitly learns how and when to be uncertain. GUIDE identifies salient internal features via a calibration stage, and then employs these features to construct a noise-driven curriculum that teaches the model how and when to express uncertainty. GUIDE requires no retraining, no architectural modifications, and no manual intermediate-layer selection to the base deep learning model, thus ensuring broad applicability and minimal user intervention. The resulting model avoids distilling overconfidence from the base model, improves out-of-distribution detection by ~77% and adversarial attack detection by ~80%, while preserving in-distribution performance. Across diverse benchmarks, GUIDE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, evidencing the need for actively guiding uncertainty to close the gap between predictive confidence and reliability.",

        "summary": "Prompt-based methods have recently gained prominence in Continual Learning (CL) due to their strong performance and memory efficiency. A prevalent strategy in this paradigm assigns a dedicated subset of prompts to each task, which, while effective, incurs substantial computational overhead and causes memory requirements to scale linearly with the number of tasks. Conversely, approaches employing a single shared prompt across tasks offer greater efficiency but often suffer from degraded performance due to knowledge interference. To reconcile this trade-off, we propose SMoPE, a novel framework that integrates the benefits of both task-specific and shared prompt strategies. Inspired by recent findings on the relationship between Prefix Tuning and Mixture of Experts (MoE), SMoPE organizes a shared prompt into multiple \"prompt experts\" within a sparse MoE architecture. For each input, only a select subset of relevant experts is activated, effectively mitigating interference. To facilitate expert selection, we introduce a prompt-attention score aggregation mechanism that computes a unified proxy score for each expert, enabling dynamic and sparse activation. Additionally, we propose an adaptive noise mechanism to encourage balanced expert utilization while preserving knowledge from prior tasks. To further enhance expert specialization, we design a prototype-based loss function that leverages prefix keys as implicit memory representations. Extensive experiments across multiple CL benchmarks demonstrate that SMoPE consistently outperforms task-specific prompt methods and achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art approaches, all while significantly reducing parameter counts and computational costs.",

Recently, Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have demonstrated promise through their improved interpretability and expressivity compared to traditional architectures based on MLPs. While equivariant KANs have been explored in recent literature for a few specific data types, a principled framework for applying them to data with permutation symmetries in a general context remains absent. This paper introduces Function Sharing KAN (FS-KAN), a principled approach to constructing equivariant and invariant KA layers for arbitrary permutation symmetry groups, unifying and significantly extending previous work in this domain. We derive the basic construction of these FS-KAN layers by generalizing parameter-sharing schemes to the Kolmogorov-Arnold setup and provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that FS-KANs have the same expressive power as networks that use standard parameter-sharing layers, allowing us to transfer well-known and important expressivity results from parameter-sharing networks to FS-KANs. Empirical evaluations on multiple data types and symmetry groups show that FS-KANs exhibit superior data efficiency compared to standard parameter-sharing layers, by a wide margin in certain cases, while preserving the interpretability and adaptability of KANs, making them an excellent architecture choice in low-data regimes.",

In this work, we study distributionally robust federated learning with explicit outlier resilience. We introduce a novel ambiguity set based on the unbalanced Wasserstein distance, which jointly captures geometric distributional shifts and incorporates a non-geometric Kullback--Leibler penalization to mitigate the influence of outliers. This formulation naturally leads to a challenging min--max--max optimization problem. To enable decentralized training, we reformulate the problem as a tractable Lagrangian penalty optimization, which admits robustness certificates. Building on this reformulation, we propose the distributionally outlier-robust federated learning algorithm and establish its convergence guarantees.

So current expert would learn the experience of best expert. The direction of best expert would help current expert's loss decrease faster. Finally, only save the weight of the best expert. Experiments show that best expert would achieve nearly the same accuracy as the full model. This would greatly reduce the size of the model for inference. Since only one expert is trained at each step, the training needs much less memory and has much higher throughput. Experiments show that the throughput would accelerate more than ten times!

While this enables strong generalization, it also introduces scalability challenges, both in terms of storage and downstream processing. A key open problem is how to achieve semantic compression, reducing the memory footprint of multimodal embeddings while preserving their ability to represent shared semantic content across modalities. In this paper, we prove a strong connection between reducing the modality gap, which is the residual separation of embeddings from different modalities, and the feasibility of post-training semantic compression. When the gap is sufficiently reduced, embeddings from different modalities but expressing the same semantics share a common portion of the space. Therefore, their centroid is a faithful representation of such a semantic concept. This enables replacing multiple embeddings with a single centroid, yielding significant memory savings. We propose a novel approach for semantic compression grounded on the latter intuition, operating directly on pretrained encoders. We demonstrate its effectiveness across diverse large-scale multimodal downstream tasks. Our results highlight that modality alignment is a key enabler for semantic compression, showing that the proposed approach achieves significant compression without sacrificing performance.",

Hyperdimensional (HD) computing, with its inherent efficiency and parallelizability, has shown promise in classification tasks but struggles to capture complex temporal patterns, while Transformers excel at sequence modeling but incur high computational and memory overhead. We introduce BiHDTrans, an efficient neurosymbolic binary hyperdimensional Transformer that integrates self-attention into the HD computing paradigm, unifying the representational efficiency of HD computing with the temporal modeling power of Transformers. Empirically, BiHDTrans outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) HD computing models by at least 14.47% and achieves 6.67% higher accuracy on average than SOTA binary Transformers. With hardware acceleration on FPGA, our pipelined implementation leverages the independent and identically distributed properties of high-dimensional representations, delivering 39.4 times lower inference latency than SOTA binary Transformers. Theoretical analysis shows that binarizing in holographic high-dimensional space incurs significantly less information distortion than directly binarizing neural networks, explaining BiHDTrans's superior accuracy. Furthermore, dimensionality experiments confirm that BiHDTrans remains competitive even with a 64% reduction in hyperspace dimensionality, surpassing SOTA binary Transformers by 1-2% in accuracy with 4.4 times less model size, as well as further reducing the latency by 49.8% compare to the full-dimensional baseline.

However, traditional anomaly detection methods focus on modeling spatial or temporal dependencies independently, resulting in suboptimal representation learning and limited sensitivity to anomalous dispersion in high-dimensional spaces. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis showing that both normal and anomalous samples tend to scatter in high-dimensional space, especially anomalous samples are markedly more dispersed. We formalize this dispersion phenomenon as scattering, quantified by the mean pairwise distance among sample representations, and leverage it as an inductive signal to enhance spatio-temporal anomaly detection. Technically, we propose ScatterAD to model representation scattering across temporal and topological dimensions. ScatterAD incorporates a topological encoder for capturing graph-structured scattering and a temporal encoder for constraining over-scattering through mean squared error minimization between neighboring time steps. We introduce a contrastive fusion mechanism to ensure the complementarity of the learned temporal and topological representations. Additionally, we theoretically show that maximizing the conditional mutual information between temporal and topological views improves cross-view consistency and enhances more discriminative representations.

        "summary": "Time-series anomaly detection (TSAD) increasingly demands explanations that articulate not only if an anomaly occurred, but also what pattern it exhibits and why it is anomalous. Leveraging the impressive explanatory capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), recent works have attempted to treat time series as text for explainable TSAD. However, this approach faces a fundamental challenge: LLMs operate on discrete tokens and struggle to directly process long, continuous signals. Consequently, naive time-to-text serialization suffers from a lack of contextual grounding and representation alignment between the two modalities. To address this gap, we introduce AXIS, a framework that conditions a frozen LLM for nuanced time-series understanding. Instead of direct serialization, AXIS enriches the LLM's input with three complementary hints derived from the series: (i) a symbolic numeric hint for numerical grounding, (ii) a context-integrated, step-aligned hint distilled from a pretrained time-series encoder to capture fine-grained dynamics, and (iii) a task-prior hint that encodes global anomaly characteristics. Furthermore, to facilitate robust evaluation of explainability, we introduce a new benchmark featuring multi-format questions and rationales that supervise contextual grounding and pattern-level semantics. Extensive experiments, including both LLM-based and human evaluations, demonstrate that AXIS yields explanations of significantly higher quality and achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to general-purpose LLMs, specialized time-series LLMs, and time-series Vision Language Models.",

In this work, we report the first successful attempt to scale up ES for fine-tuning the full parameters of LLMs, showing the surprising fact that ES can search efficiently over billions of parameters and outperform existing RL fine-tuning methods in multiple respects, including sample efficiency, tolerance to long-horizon rewards, robustness to different base LLMs, less tendency to reward hacking, and more stable performance across runs. It therefore serves as a basis to unlock a new direction in LLM fine-tuning beyond what current RL techniques provide.

In this work we address this challenge by: (i) applying the watermark in expectation over the context even when some context tokens are yet to be determined, and (ii) promoting tokens which increase the watermark strength when used as context for other tokens. This is accomplished while keeping the watermark detector unchanged. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that the DLM watermark leads to a >99% true positive rate with minimal quality impact and achieves similar robustness to existing ARLM watermarks, enabling for the first time reliable DLM watermarking.",

A number of level diversity metrics have been proposed in literature, which are naturally multi-dimensional, leading to conflicted, complementary, or both relationships among these dimensions. However, existing level generation approaches often fail to comprehensively assess diversity across those dimensions. This paper aims to expand horizons of level diversity by considering multi-dimensional diversity when training generative models. We formulate the model training as a multi-objective learning problem, where each diversity metric is treated as a distinct objective. Furthermore, a multi-objective evolutionary learning framework that optimises multiple diversity metrics simultaneously throughout the model training process is proposed. Our case study on the commonly used benchmark Super Mario Bros. demonstrates that our proposed framework can enhance multi-dimensional diversity and identify a Pareto front of generative models, which provides a range of tradeoffs among playability and two representative diversity metrics, including a content-based one and a player-centered one. Such capability enables decision-makers to make informed choices when selecting generators accommodating a variety of scenarios and the diverse needs of players and designers.",

As real-world physical environments like PDE system parameters are always capricious, how to generalize across unseen out-of-distribution (OOD) forecasting scenarios using limited training data is of great importance. To bridge this barrier, existing methods focus on discovering domain-generalizable representations across various PDE dynamics trajectories. However, their zero-shot OOD generalization capability remains deficient, since extra test-time samples for domain-specific adaptation are still required. This is because the fundamental physical invariance in PDE dynamical systems are yet to be investigated or integrated. To this end, we first explicitly define a two-fold PDE invariance principle, which points out that ingredient operators and their composition relationships remain invariant across different domains and PDE system evolution. Next, to capture this two-fold PDE invariance, we propose a physics-guided invariant learning method termed iMOOE, featuring an Invariance-aligned Mixture Of Operator Expert architecture and a frequency-enriched invariant learning objective. Extensive experiments across simulated benchmarks and real-world applications validate iMOOE's superior in-distribution performance and zero-shot generalization capabilities on diverse OOD forecasting scenarios.",

        "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) enables decentralized model training without sharing raw data. However, it remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks, which can compromise the aggregation of locally updated parameters at the central server. Similarity-aware aggregation has emerged as an effective strategy to mitigate such attacks by identifying and filtering out malicious clients based on similarity between client model parameters and those derived from clean data, i.e., data that is uncorrupted and trustworthy. However, existing methods adopt this strategy only in FL systems with clean data, making them inapplicable to settings where such data is unavailable. In this paper, we propose H+, a novel similarity-aware aggregation approach that not only outperforms existing methods in scenarios with clean data, but also extends applicability to FL systems without any clean data. Specifically, H+ randomly selects $r$-dimensional segments from the $p$-dimensional parameter vectors uploaded to the server and applies a similarity check function $H$ to compare each segment against a reference vector, preserving the most similar client vectors for aggregation. The reference vector is derived either from existing robust algorithms when clean data is unavailable or directly from clean data. Repeating this process $K$ times enables effective identification of honest clients. Moreover, H+ maintains low computational complexity, with an analytical time complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(KMr)$, where $M$ is the number of clients and $Kr \\ll p$. Comprehensive experiments validate H+ as a state-of-the-art (SOTA) method, demonstrating substantial robustness improvements over existing approaches under varying Byzantine attack ratios and multiple types of traditional Byzantine attacks, across all evaluated scenarios and benchmark datasets.",

        "summary": "Orthogonal gradient updates have emerged as a promising direction in optimization for machine learning. However, traditional approaches such as SVD/QR decomposition incur prohibitive computational costs of O(n^3) and underperform compared to well-tuned SGD with momentum, since momentum is applied only after strict orthogonalization. Recent advances, such as Muon, improve efficiency by applying momentum before orthogonalization and producing semi-orthogonal matrices via Newton-Schulz iterations, reducing complexity to O(n^2). Nevertheless, quadratic costs remain a bottleneck. In this work, we study the semi-orthogonal properties of momentum-based updates and develop a method to bound momentum updates under a spectral-norm trust region, preserving directional information without requiring explicit semi-orthogonalization. We propose AuON (Alternative Unit-norm momentum updates by Normalized nonlinear scaling), a linear-time optimizer that achieves strong performance without constructing semi-orthogonal matrices, while preserving structural alignment and reconditioning ill-posed updates. Our approach combines hyperbolic-cosine RMS scaling transformations with normalization, demonstrating both effectiveness and computational efficiency compared to Newton-Schulz methods. We further introduce a hybrid variant (Hybrid-AuON) that applies a single Newton-Schulz iteration. Experiments across vision and language benchmarks show that AuON and its hybrid variant achieve performance comparable to strong baselines such as AdamW and Muon.

In this study, we explore a Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) framework built on Universal Differential Equations (UDEs) to forecast SOC dynamics across soil depth and time. UDEs blend mechanistic physics, such as advection diffusion transport, with neural networks that learn nonlinear microbial production and respiration. Using synthetic datasets, we systematically evaluated six experimental cases, progressing from clean, noise free benchmarks to stress tests with high (35%) multiplicative, spatially correlated noise. Our results highlight both the potential and limitations of the approach. In noise free and moderate noise settings, the UDE accurately reconstructed SOC dynamics. In clean terminal profile at 50 years (Case 4) achieved near perfect fidelity, with MSE = 1.6e-5, and R2 = 0.9999. Case 5, with 7% noise, remained robust (MSE = 3.4e-6, R2 = 0.99998), capturing depth wise SOC trends while tolerating realistic measurement uncertainty. In contrast, Case 3 (35% noise at t = 0) showed clear evidence of overfitting: the model reproduced noisy inputs with high accuracy but lost generalization against the clean truth (R2 = 0.94). Case 6 (35% noise at t = 50) collapsed toward overly smooth mean profiles, failing to capture depth wise variability and yielding negative R2, underscoring the limits of standard training under severe uncertainty. These findings suggest that UDEs are well suited for scalable, noise tolerant SOC forecasting, though advancing toward field deployment will require noise aware loss functions, probabilistic modelling, and tighter integration of microbial dynamics.",

However, existing approaches still struggle to incorporate language instructions as prior constraints for EEG representation learning, limiting their ability to leverage the semantic knowledge inherent in language to unify different labels and tasks. To address this challenge, we present ELASTIQ, a foundation model for EEG-Language Alignment with Semantic Task Instruction and Querying. ELASTIQ integrates task-aware semantic guidance to produce structured and linguistically aligned EEG embeddings, thereby enhancing decoding robustness and transferability. In the pretraining stage, we introduce a joint Spectral-Temporal Reconstruction (STR) module, which combines frequency masking as a global spectral perturbation with two complementary temporal objectives: random masking to capture contextual dependencies and causal masking to model sequential dynamics. In the instruction tuning stage, we propose the Instruction-conditioned Q-Former (IQF), a query-based cross-attention transformer that injects instruction embeddings into EEG tokens and aligns them with textual label embeddings through learnable queries. We evaluate ELASTIQ on 20 datasets spanning motor imagery, emotion recognition, steady-state visual evoked potentials, covert speech, and healthcare tasks. ELASTIQ achieves state-of-the-art performance on 14 of the 20 datasets and obtains the best average results across all five task categories. Importantly, our analyses reveal for the first time that explicit task instructions serve as semantic priors guiding EEG embeddings into coherent and linguistically grounded spaces.

The lack of observable evidence makes it difficult to collect reliably labeled data, which is essential for training effective anti-cheat systems. Furthermore, cheaters often adapt their behavior by limiting or disguising their cheat usage, which further complicates detection and detector development. To address these challenges, we propose a simulation framework for controlled modeling of ESP cheaters, non-cheaters, and trajectory-based detectors. We model cheaters and non-cheaters as reinforcement learning agents with different levels of observability, while detectors classify their behavioral trajectories. Next, we formulate the interaction between the cheater and the detector as an adversarial game, allowing both players to co-adapt over time. To reflect realistic cheater strategies, we introduce a structured cheater model that dynamically switches between cheating and non-cheating behaviors based on detection risk. Experiments demonstrate that our framework successfully simulates adaptive cheater behaviors that strategically balance reward optimization and detection evasion.

To bridge this gap, we introduce the Graph Foundation Model (GFM), the first framework capable of solving all distance-based optimization problems on graph structures. By introducing the LLM-like self-supervised pre-training paradigm on the paths generated from random walks in the graph, GFM is compelled to internalize the graph's complex topological and combinatorial rules, where the connectivity of the structure itself can be treated as the supervisory signal. Unlike existing neural methods that learn complex and task-specific solving policies, our approach leverages the pre-trained GFM as a foundational model of the graph's intrinsic structure, which in turn enables a simple generative heuristic to tackle a diverse range of optimization challenges effectively. Comprehensive experiments on networks ranging from 20 to 893 nodes demonstrate that GFM achieves competitive performance against specialized solvers across a variety of distinct optimization task classes, while maintaining significantly faster inference times. Our work establishes a new paradigm of adapting the pretrain-transfer framework to graph optimization, opening the door for applying foundation model innovations to OR.",

Specifically, ChessArena is a competitive framework where LLMs play against each other, under four different play modes. The testbed is equipped with a ranking algorithm and a leaderboard. The testbed can also evaluate fine-grained capabilities including basic understanding, move selection, and puzzle solving. Over 13 LLMs with different modes are evaluated in ChessArena, playing over 800 games. The results reveal significant shortcomings in current LLMs: no model can beat Maia-1100 (a chess engine at human amateur level), while some even failed to defeat a random player that selects moves arbitrarily.

In this paper, we propose the first PU learning benchmark to systematically compare PU learning algorithms. During our implementation, we identify subtle yet critical factors that affect the realistic and fair evaluation of PU learning algorithms. On the one hand, many PU learning algorithms rely on a validation set that includes negative data for model selection. This is unrealistic in traditional PU learning settings, where no negative data are available. To handle this problem, we systematically investigate model selection criteria for PU learning. On the other hand, the problem settings and solutions of PU learning have different families, i.e., the one-sample and two-sample settings. However, existing evaluation protocols are heavily biased towards the one-sample setting and neglect the significant difference between them. We identify the internal label shift problem of unlabeled training data for the one-sample setting and propose a simple yet effective calibration approach to ensure fair comparisons within and across families.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive generalization and emergent capabilities, yet their pre-training remains computationally expensive and sensitive to optimization dynamics. While Adam-based optimizers offer fast convergence by adapting learning rates coordinate-wise, recent studies reveal that their updates often suffer from poor spectral conditioning and low-rank structures, hindering efficiency. Muon addresses this issue via global spectral normalization but lacks the per-coordinate adaptivity of Adam. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Column-Normalized Adam (Conda)}, a novel optimizer that bridges the strengths of both approaches. Conda projects updates into an orthogonal subspace and applies column-wise second moment normalization based on the projected gradients, thereby achieving both improved spectral conditioning and maintaining coordinate-wise adaptivity. This design alleviates the spectral pathologies of Adam while preserving its fast convergence behavior. Extensive experiments on the LLaMA and GPT-2 series show that Conda consistently outperforms AdamW, Muon, and other baselines in pre-training. Remarkably, on the LLaMA series, \\textbf{Conda achieves $2{\\sim}2.5\\times$ the convergence speed of AdamW, measured in both training steps and training time.} Further ablations demonstrate its robustness under diverse training setups. These results collectively highlight Conda as an effective and broadly applicable optimizer for large-scale LLM training. The code is released on https://github.com/jie040109/Conda",

        "summary": "Background Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a leading cause of global disability, yet current diagnostic approaches often rely on subjective assessments and lack the ability to integrate multimodal clinical information. Large language models (LLMs) hold promise for enhancing diagnostic accuracy through advanced reasoning but face challenges in interpretability, hallucination, and reliance on synthetic data. Methods We developed MDD-Thinker, an LLM-based diagnostic framework that integrates supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning (RL) to strengthen reasoning ability and interpretability. Using the UK Biobank dataset, we generated 40,000 reasoning samples, supplemented with 10,000 samples from publicly available mental health datasets. The model was fine-tuned on these reasoning corpora, and its diagnostic and reasoning performance was evaluated against machine learning, deep learning, and state-of-the-art LLM baselines. Findings MDD-Thinker achieved an accuracy of 0.8268 and F1-score of 0.8081, significantly outperforming traditional baselines such as SVM and MLP, as well as general-purpose LLMs. Incorporating both SFT and RL yielded the greatest improvements, with relative gains of 29.0% in accuracy, 38.1% in F1-score, and 34.8% in AUC. Moreover, the model demonstrated comparable reasoning performance compared to much larger LLMs, while maintaining computational efficiency. Interpretation This study presents the first reasoning-enhanced LLM framework for MDD diagnosis trained on large-scale real-world clinical data. By integrating SFT and RL, MDD-Thinker balances accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency, offering a scalable approach for intelligent psychiatric diagnostics. These findings suggest that reasoning-oriented LLMs can provide clinically reliable support for MDD detection and may inform broader applications in mental health care.",

        "summary": "A recently discovered class of entangled neurons, known as Wasserstein neurons, is disproportionately critical in large language models despite constituting only a very small fraction of the network: their targeted removal collapses the model, consistent with their unique role in differentiating similar inputs. Interestingly, in Wasserstein neurons immediately preceding smooth activation functions, such differentiation manifests in the negative pre-activation space, especially in early layers. Pairs of similar inputs are driven to highly distinct negative values, and these pairs involve syntactic tokens such as determiners and prepositions. We show that this negative region is functional rather than simply favorable for optimization. A minimal, sign-specific intervention that zeroes only the negative pre-activations of a small subset of entangled neurons significantly weakens overall model function and disrupts grammatical behavior, while both random and perplexity-matched controls leave grammatical performance largely unchanged. Part of speech analysis localizes the excess surprisal to syntactic scaffolding tokens, and layer-specific interventions reveal that small local degradations accumulate across depth. Over training checkpoints, the same ablation impairs grammatical behavior as Wasserstein neurons emerge and stabilize. Together, these results identify negative differentiation in a sparse subset of entangled neurons as a crucial mechanism that language models rely on for syntax.",

        "summary": "Freezing-of-Gait (FoG) affects over 50% of mid-to-late stage Parkinson's disease (PD) patients, significantly impairing patients' mobility independence and reducing quality of life. FoG is characterized by sudden episodes where walking cannot start or is interrupted, occurring exclusively during standing or walking, and never while sitting or lying down. Current FoG detection systems require extensive patient-specific training data and lack generalization, limiting clinical deployment. To address these issues, we introduce FM-FoG, a real-time foundation model-based wearable system achieving FoG detection in unseen patients without patient-specific training. Our approach combines self-supervised pretraining on diverse Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) datasets with sensor context integration. Since FoG occurs only during ambulatory activities, a lightweight CNN-LSTM activity classifier selectively activates the foundation model only during walking or standing, avoiding unnecessary computation. Evaluated on the VCU FoG-IMU dataset with 23 PD patients, FM-FoG achieves a 98.5% F1-score when tested on previously unseen patients, substantially outperforming competitive baseline methods. Deployed on a Google Pixel 8a smartphone, the system extends battery life by up to 72% while maintaining sub-20ms intervention latency. The results indicate that our FM-FoG can enable practical, energy-efficient healthcare applications that generalize across patients without individual training requirements.",

Existing similarity-based methods often require access to model parameters or produce heuristic scores without principled thresholds, limiting their applicability. We introduce Random Selection Probing (RSP), a hypothesis-testing framework that formulates model correlation detection as a statistical test. RSP optimizes textual or visual prefixes on a reference model for a random selection task and evaluates their transferability to a target model, producing rigorous p-values that quantify evidence of correlation. To mitigate false positives, RSP incorporates an unrelated baseline model to filter out generic, transferable features. We evaluate RSP across both LLMs and VLMs under diverse access conditions for reference models and test models. Experiments on fine-tuned and open-source models show that RSP consistently yields small p-values for related models while maintaining high p-values for unrelated ones. Extensive ablation studies further demonstrate the robustness of RSP. These results establish RSP as the first principled and general statistical framework for model correlation detection, enabling transparent and interpretable decisions in modern machine learning ecosystems.",

A critical challenge in autoencoder design is to preserve the geometric structure of data in the latent space, with existing approaches typically focusing on either global or local geometric properties separately. Global approaches often encounter errors in distance approximation that accumulate, while local methods frequently converge to suboptimal solutions that distort large-scale relationships. We propose Multi-Scale Geometric Autoencoder (MAE), which introduces an asymmetric architecture that simultaneously preserves both scales of the geometric structure by applying global distance constraints to the encoder and local geometric constraints to the decoder. Through theoretical analysis, we establish that this asymmetric design aligns naturally with the distinct roles of the encoder and decoder components. Our comprehensive experiments on both synthetic manifolds and real-world datasets demonstrate that MAE consistently outperforms existing methods across various evaluation metrics.",

        "summary": "Machine unlearning in large language models (LLMs) is essential for privacy and safety; however, existing approaches remain unstable and unreliable. A widely used strategy, the gradient difference method, applies gradient descent on retained data while performing gradient ascent on forget data, the data whose influence should be removed. However, when combined with cross-entropy loss, this procedure causes unbounded growth of weights and gradients, leading to training instability and degrading both forgetting and retention. We provide a theoretical framework that explains this failure, explicitly showing how ascent on the forget set destabilizes optimization in the feedforward MLP layers of LLMs. Guided by this insight, we propose Bounded Parameter-Efficient Unlearning, a parameter-efficient approach that stabilizes LoRA-based fine-tuning by applying bounded functions to MLP adapters. This simple modification controls the weight dynamics during ascent, enabling the gradient difference method to converge reliably. Across the TOFU, TDEC, and MUSE benchmarks, and across architectures and scales from 125M to 8B parameters, our method achieves substantial improvements in forgetting while preserving retention, establishing a novel theoretically grounded and practically scalable framework for unlearning in LLMs.",

        "summary": "Accurate cyclone forecasting is essential for minimizing loss of life, infrastructure damage, and economic disruption. Traditional numerical weather prediction models, though effective, are computationally intensive and prone to error due to the chaotic nature of atmospheric systems. This study proposes a machine learning (ML) approach to forecasting tropical cyclone trajectory and status using time series data from the National Hurricane Center, including recently added best track wind radii. A two-stage ML pipeline is developed: a regression model first predicts cyclone features maximum wind speed, minimum pressure, trajectory length, and directional change using a sliding window of historical data. These outputs are then input into classification models to predict the cyclone's categorical status. Gradient boosting regression and three classifiers random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and multilayer perceptron (MLP) are evaluated. After hyperparameter tuning and synthetic minority oversampling (SMOTE), the RF classifier achieves the highest performance with 93% accuracy, outperforming SVM and MLP across precision, recall, and F1 score. The RF model is particularly robust in identifying minority cyclone statuses and minimizing false negatives. Regression results yield low mean absolute errors, with pressure and wind predictions within about 2.2 mb and 2.4 kt, respectively. These findings demonstrate that ML models, especially ensemble-based classifiers, offer an effective, scalable alternative to traditional forecasting methods, with potential for real-time cyclone prediction and integration into decision support systems.",

Our approach uses localized trigonometric polynomial kernels initially developed for the point source signal separation problem in signal processing. Rather than point sources, we argue that the various classes come from different probability distributions. The localized kernel technique developed for separating point sources is then shown to separate the supports of these distributions. This is done in a hierarchical manner in our MASC algorithm to accommodate touching/overlapping class boundaries. We illustrate our theory on several simulated and real life datasets, including the Salinas and Indian Pines hyperspectral datasets and a document dataset.",

Given a permutation and a string to which that permutation has been applied, the model is tasked with producing the original (``canonical'') string. We argue that this task models a natural robustness property across a variety of reasoning tasks, including long-context retrieval, multiple choice QA and in-context learning. Our primary contribution is an impossibility result: we show that an arbitrary depth, decoder-only transformer cannot learn this task. This result concerns the expressive capacity of decoder-only transformer models and is agnostic to training dynamics or sample complexity. We give a pair of alternative constructions under which inverse permutation learning is feasible. The first of these highlights the fundamental role of the causal attention mask, and reveals a gap between the expressivity of encoder-decoder transformers and the more popular decoder-only architecture. The latter result is more surprising: we show that simply padding the input with ``scratch tokens\" yields a construction under which inverse permutation learning is possible. We conjecture that this may suggest an alternative mechanism by which chain-of-thought prompting or, more generally, intermediate ``thinking'' tokens can enable reasoning in large language models, even when these tokens encode no meaningful semantic information (e.g., the results of intermediate computations).",

        "summary": "At the heart of time-series forecasting (TSF) lies a fundamental challenge: how can models efficiently and effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies across ever-growing sequences? While deep learning has brought notable progress, conventional architectures often face a trade-off between computational complexity and their ability to retain accumulative information over extended horizons. Echo State Networks (ESNs), a class of reservoir computing models, have recently regained attention for their exceptional efficiency, offering constant memory usage and per-step training complexity regardless of input length. This makes them particularly attractive for modeling extremely long-term event history in TSF. However, traditional ESNs fall short of state-of-the-art performance due to their limited nonlinear capacity, which constrains both their expressiveness and stability. We introduce Echo Flow Networks (EFNs), a framework composed of a group of extended Echo State Networks (X-ESNs) with MLP readouts, enhanced by our novel Matrix-Gated Composite Random Activation (MCRA), which enables complex, neuron-specific temporal dynamics, significantly expanding the network's representational capacity without compromising computational efficiency. In addition, we propose a dual-stream architecture in which recent input history dynamically selects signature reservoir features from an infinite-horizon memory, leading to improved prediction accuracy and long-term stability. Extensive evaluations on five benchmarks demonstrate that EFNs achieve up to 4x faster training and 3x smaller model size compared to leading methods like PatchTST, reducing forecasting error from 43% to 35%, a 20% relative improvement.

First-principles methods are widely used to compute defect energetics and structures, including at scale for high-throughput defect databases.

Most existing MLFFs are based on graph neural networks (GNNs), which can suffer from oversmoothing and poor representation of long-range interactions. Both of these issues are especially of concern when modeling point defects. To address these challenges, we introduce the Accelerated Deep Atomic Potential Transformer (ADAPT), an MLFF that replaces graph representations with a direct coordinates-in-space formulation and explicitly considers all pairwise atomic interactions. Atoms are treated as tokens, with a Transformer encoder modeling their interactions. Applied to a dataset of silicon point defects, ADAPT achieves a roughly 33 percent reduction in both force and energy prediction errors relative to a state-of-the-art GNN-based model, while requiring only a fraction of the computational cost.",

        "summary": "As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in social domains to make predictions about humans, there is a growing concern that these algorithms may exhibit biases against certain social groups. Numerous notions of fairness have been proposed in the literature to measure the unfairness of ML. Among them, one class that receives the most attention is \\textit{parity-based}, i.e., achieving fairness by equalizing treatment or outcomes for different social groups. However, achieving parity-based fairness often comes at the cost of lowering model accuracy and is undesirable for many high-stakes domains like healthcare. To avoid inferior accuracy, a line of research focuses on \\textit{preference-based} fairness, under which any group of individuals would experience the highest accuracy and collectively prefer the ML outcomes assigned to them if they were given the choice between various sets of outcomes. However, these works assume individual demographic information is known and fully accessible during training. In this paper, we relax this requirement and propose a novel \\textit{demographic-agnostic fairness without harm (DAFH)} optimization algorithm, which jointly learns a group classifier that partitions the population into multiple groups and a set of decoupled classifiers associated with these groups. Theoretically, we conduct sample complexity analysis and show that our method can outperform the baselines when demographic information is known and used to train decoupled classifiers. Experiments on both synthetic and real data validate the proposed method.",

Recently, explainable artificial intelligence has come up with numerous method to tackle this challenge. A promising avenue is to use concept-based explanations, that is, high-level concepts instead of plain feature importance score. Among this class of methods, Concept Activation vectors (CAVs), Kim et al. (2018) stands out as one of the main protagonists. One interesting aspect of CAVs is that their computation requires sampling random examples in the train set. Therefore, the actual vectors obtained may vary from user to user depending on the randomness of this sampling. In this paper, we propose a fine-grained theoretical analysis of CAVs construction in order to quantify their variability. Our results, confirmed by experiments on several real-life datasets, point out towards an universal result: the variance of CAVs decreases as $1/N$, where $N$ is the number of random examples. Based on this we give practical recommendations for a resource-efficient application of the method.",

Existing approaches typically rely on external routers, implemented as binary classifiers, which often struggle to determine task difficulty from the prompt's surface pattern. To address these limitations, we propose a framework where the on-device LLM makes routing decisions at the end of its solving process, with this capability instilled through post-training. In particular, we formulate a reward maximization problem with carefully designed rewards that encourage effective problem solving and judicious offloading to the cloud. To solve this problem, we develop a group-adaptive policy gradient algorithm, featuring a group-level policy gradient, designed to yield an unbiased gradient estimator of the reward, and adaptive prompt filtering, developed to enforce the constraint on cloud LLM usage. Extensive experiments across models and benchmarks show that the proposed methodology consistently outperforms existing baselines and significantly narrows the gap to full cloud LLM performance.",

Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods. Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.",

While much research has gone into fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on pretraining losses and on discriminative evaluations such as multiple-choice question-answering, comparatively little research has been done on fitting scaling laws and predicting performance on generative evaluations such as mathematical problem-solving or software engineering. We propose and evaluate three different pretraining scaling laws for fitting pass-at-$k$ on generative evaluations and for predicting pass-at-$k$ of the most expensive model using the performance of cheaper models. Our three scaling laws differ in the covariates used: (1) compute, (2) model parameters and tokens, (3) log likelihoods of gold reference solutions. We make four main contributions: (1) We show how generative evaluations offer new hyperparameters (in our setting, $k$) that researchers can use to control the scaling laws parameters and the predictability of performance. (2) In terms of scaling law parameters, we find that the compute scaling law and parameters\\,+\\,tokens scaling law stabilize for the last ~$1.5{-}2.5$ orders of magnitude, whereas the gold reference likelihood scaling law stabilizes for the last ~$5$ orders of magnitude. (3) In terms of predictive performance, we find all three scaling laws perform comparably, although the compute scaling law predicts slightly worse for small $k$ and the log likelihoods of gold reference solutions predicts slightly worse for large $k$. (4) We establish a theoretical connection that the compute scaling law emerges as the compute-optimal envelope of the parameters-and-tokens scaling law.

We consider two sources of spurious correlations caused by group imbalance: (i) a weak teacher fine-tuned on group-imbalanced labeled data with a minority group of fraction $\\eta_\\ell$, and (ii) a group-imbalanced unlabeled set pseudolabeled by the teacher with a minority group of fraction $\\eta_u$. Theoretically, a precise characterization of W2S gain at the proportional asymptotic limit shows that W2S always happens with sufficient pseudolabels when $\\eta_u = \\eta_\\ell$ but may fail when $\\eta_u \\ne \\eta_\\ell$, where W2S gain diminishes as $(\\eta_u - \\eta_\\ell)^2$ increases. Our theory is corroborated by extensive experiments on various spurious correlation benchmarks and teacher-student pairs. To boost W2S performance upon failures, we further propose a simple, effective algorithmic remedy that retrains the strong student on its high-confidence data subset after W2S fine-tuning. Our algorithm is group-label-free and achieves consistent, substantial improvements over vanilla W2S fine-tuning.",

This paper introduces a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework to generate functional and gas-optimized Solidity smart contracts directly from CDM specifications. We employ a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) agent that learns to select optimal code snippets from a pre-defined library. To manage the complex search space, a two-phase curriculum first trains the agent for functional correctness before shifting its focus to gas optimization. Our empirical results show the RL agent learns to generate contracts with significant gas savings, achieving cost reductions of up to 35.59% on unseen test data compared to unoptimized baselines.

In the years since, however, valid concerns about Chinchilla have been raised: wide confidence intervals, discrepancies between its three approaches, and incongruities with other scaling laws. This raises a critical question for the field: Can practitioners still rely on Chinchilla's prescriptions? Our work demonstrates the answer is yes. We begin by uncovering that the model parameters central to Chinchilla's analyses were ambiguous: three interpretations are possible, with relative differences between different interpretations of model parameters as high as 15.2%. We find that, perhaps surprisingly, which model parameters are used for the analyses do not meaningfully affect key results: the scaling law estimates and the compute-optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio. Indeed, under one interpretation, the tokens-to-parameter ratio becomes more constant with the target compute budget. We then ask how distorted the Chinchilla model parameters could have been without meaningfully affecting the key results. By deliberately perturbing model parameters in four structured ways, we find that key Chinchilla results are most sensitive to additive or systematic errors, which can alter the otherwise flat trend of the optimal tokens-to-parameter ratio, but overall, Chinchilla's key results withstand sizable perturbations. Altogether, our findings offer the field renewed confidence in Chinchilla as a durable guide for scaling language models.",

These methods aim to find Pareto stationary points by using heuristics that require access to task loss values, gradients, or both. In doing so, a central challenge arises because task losses can be arbitrarily, nonaffinely scaled relative to one another, causing certain tasks to dominate training and degrade overall performance. A recent advance in cooperative bargaining theory, the Direction-based Bargaining Solution (DiBS), yields Pareto stationary solutions immune to task domination because of its invariance to monotonic nonaffine task loss transformations. However, the convergence behavior of DiBS in nonconvex MTL settings is currently not understood. To this end, we prove that under standard assumptions, a subsequence of DiBS iterates converges to a Pareto stationary point when task losses are possibly nonconvex, and propose DiBS-MTL, a computationally efficient adaptation of DiBS to the MTL setting. Finally, we validate DiBS-MTL empirically on standard MTL benchmarks, showing that it achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art methods while maintaining robustness to nonaffine monotonic transformations that significantly degrade the performance of existing approaches, including prior bargaining-inspired MTL methods.

First, owing to the fact that the drafter and the target VLM may derived from different families, the semantic representations of visual tokens in the target VLM are misaligned with those in the drafter, introducing bias into the KV-cache during the prefill stage. Second, the large number of visual tokens substantially slows down the drafter's self-attention during the decoding stage. We propose Hiding Visual Tokens from the Drafter for Speculative Decoding in Vision-Language Models (HiViS), an explicit-implicit input decomposition framework that alleviates the above inefficiency. All visual tokens are removed from the drafter's input, retaining only textual tokens as explicit inputs, while directly reusing the target VLM's corresponding last-layer hidden states as implicit visual information without additional processing. To train the drafter efficiently, we introduces multi-step self-feedback training strategy with dynamic data selection and sequential embedding supervision to simulate reasoning during training. Our approach compresses the prefill sequence length of the drafter to only 0.7%-1.3% of the target VLM's input, while maintaining lossless generation quality. Extensive experiments across diverse models and tasks demonstrate up to 2.65x speedup, confirming the effectiveness of HiViS in accelerating VLM inference.",

However, complex geographic environments lead to unpredictable and highly dynamic wireless channel conditions, resulting in frequent interruptions of air-to-ground (A2G) links that severely constrain the reliability and quality of service in UAV swarm-assisted mobile communications. To improve the quality of UAV swarm-assisted communications in complex geographic environments, we propose an integrated communication and control co-design mechanism. Given the stringent energy constraints inherent in UAV swarms, our proposed mechanism is designed to optimize energy efficiency while maintaining an equilibrium between equitable communication rates for mobile ground users (GUs) and UAV energy expenditure. We formulate the joint resource allocation and 3D trajectory control problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), and develop a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework to enable real-time coordinated actions across the UAV swarm. To optimize the action policy of UAV swarms, we propose a novel multi-agent hybrid proximal policy optimization with action masking (MAHPPO-AM) algorithm, specifically designed to handle complex hybrid action spaces. The algorithm incorporates action masking to enforce hard constraints in high-dimensional action spaces. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a fairness index of 0.99 while reducing energy consumption by up to 25% compared to baseline methods.",

In this work, we propose $D$-Gating, a fully differentiable structured overparameterization that splits each group of weights into a primary weight vector and multiple scalar gating factors. We prove that any local minimum under $D$-Gating is also a local minimum using non-smooth structured $L_{2,2/D}$ penalization, and further show that the $D$-Gating objective converges at least exponentially fast to the $L_{2,2/D}$-regularized loss in the gradient flow limit. Together, our results show that $D$-Gating is theoretically equivalent to solving the original group sparsity problem, yet induces distinct learning dynamics that evolve from a non-sparse regime into sparse optimization. We validate our theory across vision, language, and tabular tasks, where $D$-Gating consistently delivers strong performance-sparsity tradeoffs and outperforms both direct optimization of structured penalties and conventional pruning baselines.",

For example, a teacher that \"likes owls\" can make its student \"like owls\" too, even when the training data consists only of lists of numbers. This surprising phenomenon is called subliminal learning. Subliminal learning can be expected under soft distillation, where the student is trained on the teacher's full next-token distribution. But the fact that this also occurs under hard distillation-where the student only sees sampled tokens-raises a deeper question: when and how does subliminal learning actually occur? We answer this question through controlled experiments and mechanistic analysis. Our results show that subliminal learning does not need (global) token entanglement or logit leakage. Instead, it comes down to a small set of divergence tokens-rare cases where teachers with different biases would predict different tokens. Masking out these tokens mostly removes the hidden bias transfer. Mechanistically, divergence tokens reveal that early layers are critical. Surprisingly, finetuning even a single such early layer is sufficient for subliminal learning. Finally, we find that subliminal learning is fragile. Even small changes, like paraphrasing prompts, are usually sufficient to suppress it.",

Moreover, they can be conditioned to sample from specific distributions, making them highly flexible. We leverage conditional sampling to learn policies that are robust to uncertainty in environment dynamics. Building on the established connection between Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) optimization and robust RL, we introduce Adversarial Diffusion for Robust Reinforcement Learning (AD-RRL). AD-RRL guides the diffusion process to generate worst-case trajectories during training, effectively optimizing the CVaR of the cumulative return.

However, the standard deterministic routing mechanism presents a significant limitation: its inherent brittleness is a key contributor to model miscalibration and overconfidence, resulting in systems that often do not know what they don't know. This thesis confronts this challenge by proposing a structured \\textbf{Bayesian MoE routing framework}. Instead of forcing a single, deterministic expert selection, our approach models a probability distribution over the routing decision itself. We systematically investigate three families of methods that introduce this principled uncertainty at different stages of the routing pipeline: in the \\textbf{weight-space}, the \\textbf{logit-space}, and the final \\textbf{selection-space}. Through a series of controlled experiments on a 3-billion parameter MoE model, we demonstrate that this framework significantly improves routing stability, in-distribution calibration, and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection. The results show that by targeting this core architectural component, we can create a more reliable internal uncertainty signal. This work provides a practical and computationally tractable pathway towards building more robust and self-aware LLMs, taking a crucial step towards making them know what they don't know.",

Most generative models that predict atomic coordinates overlook these symmetry constraints, leading to unrealistically high populations of proposed crystals exhibiting limited symmetry. We introduce Space Group Conditional Flow Matching, a novel generative framework that samples significantly closer to the target population of highly-symmetric, stable crystals. We achieve this by conditioning the entire generation process on a given space group and set of Wyckoff positions; specifically, we define a conditionally symmetric noise base distribution and a group-conditioned, equivariant, parametric vector field that restricts the motion of atoms to their initial Wyckoff position. Our form of group-conditioned equivariance is achieved using an efficient reformulation of \\emph{group averaging} tailored for symmetric crystals. Importantly, it reduces the computational overhead of symmetrization to a negligible level. We achieve state of the art results on crystal structure prediction and de novo generation benchmarks.

However, due to the evolving nature of dynamic graph data distributions over time, well-trained DGNNs often face significant performance uncertainty when inferring on unseen and unlabeled test graphs in practical deployment. In this case, evaluating the performance of deployed DGNNs at test time is crucial to determine whether a well-trained DGNN is suited for inference on an unseen dynamic test graph. In this work, we introduce a new research problem: DGNN model evaluation, which aims to assess the performance of a specific DGNN model trained on observed dynamic graphs by estimating its performance on unseen dynamic graphs during test time. Specifically, we propose a Dynamic Graph neural network Evaluator, dubbed DyGEval, to address this new problem. The proposed DyGEval involves a two-stage framework: (1) test-time dynamic graph simulation, which captures the training-test distributional differences as supervision signals and trains an evaluator; and (2) DyGEval development and training, which accurately estimates the performance of the well-trained DGNN model on the test-time dynamic graphs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DyGEval serves as an effective evaluator for assessing various DGNN backbones across different dynamic graphs under distribution shifts.",

Although recent advances have significantly improved the modeling of temporal dynamics and inter-variable dependencies, most existing methods overlook index-related descriptive information, such as timestamps and variable indices, which carry rich contextual semantics. To unlock the potential of such information and take advantage of the lightweight and powerful periodic capture ability of MLP-based architectures, we propose IndexNet, an MLP-based framework augmented with an Index Embedding (IE) module. The IE module consists of two key components: Timestamp Embedding (TE) and Channel Embedding (CE). Specifically, TE transforms timestamps into embedding vectors and injects them into the input sequence, thereby improving the model's ability to capture long-term complex periodic patterns. In parallel, CE assigns each variable a unique and trainable identity embedding based on its index, allowing the model to explicitly distinguish between heterogeneous variables and avoid homogenized predictions when input sequences seem close. Extensive experiments on 12 diverse real-world datasets demonstrate that IndexNet achieves comparable performance across mainstream baselines, validating the effectiveness of our temporally and variably aware design. Moreover, plug-and-play experiments and visualization analyses further reveal that IndexNet exhibits strong generality and interpretability, two aspects that remain underexplored in current MTSF research.",

        "summary": "Quantization techniques are essential for the deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices. However, prevailing methods often rely on mixed-precision multiplication that lacks efficient hardware support, making it not feasible. Ternary weight quantization addresses this by constraining weights to {-1, 0, 1}, replacing expensive multiplications with hardware-efficient additions. However, such aggressive compression leads to significant accuracy degradation, even after costly quantization-aware training with massive data. We identify the core issue as deadzone trapping: a large number of weights are trapped at the deadzone boundary. This occurs because these weights receive only noisy, uninformative gradients, preventing stable escape from the deadzone and severely impeding model capacity and optimization. To address this issue, we propose Tequila, a trapping-free quantization optimization method that reactivates deadzone-trapped weights by repurposing them as dynamic biases. This allows the repurposed weights to provide a continuous signal in the forward pass and, critically, receive direct, meaningful gradient signals during backpropagation, thereby enhancing model capacity and optimization with nearly zero inference overhead. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Tequila outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) ternary quantization methods across five benchmarks. Specifically, on the ARC benchmark, it achieves >4% accuracy gain over the SOTA baseline, nearly matching full-precision performance (within <1% gap) with a 3.0x inference speedup. Consequently, Tequila offers a highly practical and efficient implementation for the deployment of advanced LLMs in resource-constrained environments.

However, its effectiveness in multi-stage tasks, where agents sequentially perform sub-tasks (e.g., navigation, grasping), is limited by stage misalignment: Comparing segments from mismatched stages, such as movement versus manipulation, results in uninformative feedback, thus hindering policy learning. In this paper, we validate the stage misalignment issue through theoretical analysis and empirical experiments. To address this issue, we propose STage-AlIgned Reward learning (STAIR), which first learns a stage approximation based on temporal distance, then prioritizes comparisons within the same stage. Temporal distance is learned via contrastive learning, which groups temporally close states into coherent stages, without predefined task knowledge, and adapts dynamically to policy changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate STAIR's superiority in multi-stage tasks and competitive performance in single-stage tasks. Furthermore, human studies show that stages approximated by STAIR are consistent with human cognition, confirming its effectiveness in mitigating stage misalignment.",

To refine the steering vectors learned from limited data, we introduce Refinement of Steering Vector via Sparse Autoencoder (SAE-RSV) that leverages SAEs to semantically denoise and augment the steering vectors. In our framework, we first remove task-irrelevant features according to their semantics provided by SAEs, and then enrich task-relevant features missing from the small dataset through their semantic similarity to the identified relevant features.

The results reveal that integrating Visual CoT consistently improves absolute accuracy regardless of whether the input images are clean or corrupted by noise; however, it also increases sensitivity to input perturbations, resulting in sharper performance degradation compared to standard VLMs. Through extensive analysis, we identify the intermediate reasoning components of Visual CoT, i.e., the edited image patches , as the primary source of fragility. Building on this analysis, we propose a plug-and-play robustness enhancement method that integrates Grounding DINO model into the Visual CoT pipeline, providing high-confidence local visual cues to stabilize reasoning.

        "summary": "State-space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, emerge as an efficient Transformer alternative with linear complexity for long-sequence modeling. Recent empirical works demonstrate Mamba's in-context learning (ICL) capabilities competitive with Transformers, a critical capacity for large foundation models. However, theoretical understanding of Mamba's ICL remains limited, restricting deeper insights into its underlying mechanisms. Even fundamental tasks such as linear regression ICL, widely studied as a standard theoretical benchmark for Transformers, have not been thoroughly analyzed in the context of Mamba. To address this gap, we study the training dynamics of Mamba on the linear regression ICL task. By developing novel techniques tackling non-convex optimization with gradient descent related to Mamba's structure, we establish an exponential convergence rate to ICL solution, and derive a loss bound that is comparable to Transformer's. Importantly, our results reveal that Mamba can perform a variant of \\textit{online gradient descent} to learn the latent function in context. This mechanism is different from that of Transformer, which is typically understood to achieve ICL through gradient descent emulation. The theoretical results are verified by experimental simulation.",

SHAPoint supports classification, regression, and survival tasks, while also inheriting valuable properties from tree-based models, such as native handling of missing data and support for monotonic constraints. Compared to existing frameworks, SHAPoint offers superior flexibility, reduced reliance on manual preprocessing, and faster runtime performance.

        "summary": "Batch Normalization (BN) has played a pivotal role in the success of deep learning by improving training stability, mitigating overfitting, and enabling more effective optimization. However, its adoption in deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has been limited due to the inherent non-i.i.d. nature of data and the dynamically shifting distributions induced by the agent's learning process. In this paper, we argue that, despite these challenges, BN retains unique advantages in DRL settings, particularly through its stochasticity and its ability to ease training. When applied appropriately, BN can adapt to evolving data distributions and enhance both convergence speed and final performance. To this end, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the use of BN in off-policy actor-critic algorithms, systematically analyzing how different training and evaluation modes impact performance. We further identify failure modes that lead to instability or divergence, analyze their underlying causes, and propose the Mode-Aware Batch Normalization (MA-BN) method with practical actionable recommendations for robust BN integration in DRL pipelines. We also empirically validate that, in RL settings, MA-BN accelerates and stabilizes training, broadens the effective learning rate range, enhances exploration, and reduces overall optimization difficulty.

To address these challenges, we propose a novel Self-Adaptive Frequency Domain Network (SAFDNet). Specifically, SAFDNet integrates an adaptive spectral block, which leverages Fourier analysis to extract frequency-domain features and employs self-adaptive thresholding to mitigate noise. Additionally, an interactive attention block is introduced to capture both long-term and short-term dependencies in the data. Extensive internal and external validations on two large-scale real-world datasets demonstrate that SAFDNet achieves up to 97.3\\% AUROC in IOH early warning, outperforming state-of-the-art models.

In this paper, we investigate deterministic policy gradient methods for continuous-time RL. We derive a continuous-time policy gradient formula based on an analogue of the advantage function and establish its martingale characterization. This theoretical foundation leads to our proposed algorithm, CT-DDPG, which enables stable learning with deterministic policies in continuous-time environments. Numerical experiments show that the proposed CT-DDPG algorithm offers improved stability and faster convergence compared to existing discrete-time and continuous-time methods, across a wide range of control tasks with varying time discretizations and noise levels.",

With the growing number of TSFMs, efficiently identifying the best model for downstream fine-tuning becomes increasingly challenging. In this work, we introduce TimeTic, a transferability estimation framework that recasts model selection as an in-context-learning problem: given observations on known (source) datasets, it predicts how a TSFM will perform after fine-tuning on a downstream (target) dataset. TimeTic flexibly organizes the observed model-data relationships as contextual information, allowing it to adapt seamlessly to various test-time scenarios. Leveraging the natural tabular structure formed by dataset meta-features, model characteristics, and fine-tuned performance, we employ tabular foundation models to serve as in-context learners. We further introduce a novel model characterization based on entropy evolution across model layers, capturing embedding-space distinctions and enabling TimeTic to generalize across arbitrary model sets. We establish a comprehensive benchmark for transferability estimation including 10 datasets, 10 foundation models, and 3 forecasting tasks. On this benchmark, TimeTic's estimation demonstrates strong alignment with actual fine-tuned performance for previously unseen datasets, achieving a mean rank correlation of approximately 0.6 and a 30% improvement compared to using zero-shot performance as the transferability score.",

Recent works have explored the impact of MM on adversarial attacks, particularly backdoor attacks. However, none of them have sufficiently explored its impact on transfer attacks using adversarial examples, i.e., a black-box adversarial attack where examples generated for a surrogate model successfully mislead a target model. In this work, we study the effect of MM on the transferability of adversarial examples. We perform comprehensive evaluations and statistical analysis consisting of 8 MM methods, 7 datasets, and 6 attack methods, sweeping over 336 distinct attack settings. Through it, we first challenge the prevailing notion of MM conferring free adversarial robustness, and show MM cannot reliably defend against transfer attacks, with over 95% relative transfer attack success rate. Moreover, we reveal 3 key insights for machine-learning practitioners regarding MM and transferability for a robust system design: (1) stronger MM methods increase vulnerability to transfer attacks; (2) mitigating representation bias increases vulnerability to transfer attacks; and (3) weight averaging, despite being the weakest MM method, is the most vulnerable MM method to transfer attacks. Finally, we analyze the underlying reasons for this increased vulnerability, and provide potential solutions to the problem. Our findings offer critical insights for designing more secure systems employing MM.",

        "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) trains models locally at each research center or clinic and aggregates only model updates, making it a natural fit for medical imaging, where strict privacy laws forbid raw data sharing. A major obstacle is scanner-induced domain shift: non-biological variations in hardware or acquisition protocols can cause models to fail on external sites. Most harmonization methods correct this shift by directly comparing data across sites, conflicting with FL's privacy constraints. Domain Generalization (DG) offers a privacy-friendly alternative - learning site-invariant representations without sharing raw data - but standard DG pipelines still assume centralized access to multi-site data, again violating FL's guarantees. This paper meets these difficulties with a straightforward integration of a Domain-Adversarial Neural Network (DANN) within the FL process. After demonstrating that a naive federated DANN fails to converge, we propose a proximal regularization method that stabilizes adversarial training among clients. Experiments on T1-weighted 3-D brain MRIs from the OpenBHB dataset, performing brain-age prediction on participants aged 6-64 y (mean 22+/-6 y; 45 percent male) in training and 6-79 y (mean 19+/-13 y; 55 percent male) in validation, show that training on 15 sites and testing on 19 unseen sites yields superior cross-site generalization over FedAvg and ERM while preserving data privacy.",

Empirical inspection of LoRA updates shows that new features concentrate in mid-layer MLPs, yet the scale of these layers obscures meaningful structure. Prior probing suggests that statistical priors may strengthen, split, or vanish across depth, motivating the need to study how neurons work together rather than in isolation. We introduce a mechanistic interpretability framework based on coalitional game theory, where neurons mimic agents in a hedonic game whose preferences capture their synergistic contributions to layer-local computations. Using top-responsive utilities and the PAC-Top-Cover algorithm, we extract stable coalitions of neurons: groups whose joint ablation has non-additive effects. We then track their transitions across layers as persistence, splitting, merging, or disappearance. Applied to LLaMA, Mistral, and Pythia rerankers fine-tuned on scalar IR tasks, our method finds coalitions with consistently higher synergy than clustering baselines. By revealing how neurons cooperate to encode features, hedonic coalitions uncover higher-order structure beyond disentanglement and yield computational units that are functionally important, interpretable, and predictive across domains.",

However, the emergence of new tasks introduces both temporal and cross-client shifts, making catastrophic forgetting a critical challenge. Most existing works aggregate knowledge from clients into a global model, which may not enhance client performance since irrelevant knowledge could introduce interference, especially in heterogeneous scenarios. Additionally, directly applying decentralized approaches to FCL suffers from ineffective group formation caused by task changes. To address these challenges, we propose a decentralized dynamic cooperation framework for FCL, where clients establish dynamic cooperative learning coalitions to balance the acquisition of new knowledge and the retention of prior learning, thereby obtaining personalized models. To maximize model performance, each client engages in selective cooperation, dynamically allying with others who offer meaningful performance gains. This results in non-overlapping, variable coalitions at each stage of the task. Moreover, we use coalitional affinity game to simulate coalition relationships between clients. By assessing both client gradient coherence and model similarity, we quantify the client benefits derived from cooperation. We also propose a merge-blocking algorithm and a dynamic cooperative evolution algorithm to achieve cooperative and dynamic equilibrium.

DIMIGNN introduces a Diversity-aware Neighbor Selection Mechanism (DNSM) to ensure that each variable shares high informational similarity with its neighbors while maintaining diversity among neighbors themselves.

Unlike multivariate time series from other domains, stock time series exhibit industry correlation. Exploiting this kind of correlation can improve forecasting accuracy. However, existing methods based on hypergraphs can only capture industry correlation relatively superficially. These methods face two key limitations: they do not fully consider inter-industry lead-lag interactions, and they do not model multi-scale information within and among industries. This study proposes the Hermes framework for stock time series forecasting that aims to improve the exploitation of industry correlation by eliminating these limitations. The framework integrates moving aggregation and multi-scale fusion modules in a hypergraph network. Specifically, to more flexibly capture the lead-lag relationships among industries, Hermes proposes a hyperedge-based moving aggregation module. This module incorporates a sliding window and utilizes dynamic temporal aggregation operations to consider lead-lag dependencies among industries. Additionally, to effectively model multi-scale information, Hermes employs cross-scale, edge-to-edge message passing to integrate information from different scales while maintaining the consistency of each scale. Experimental results on multiple real-world stock datasets show that Hermes outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in both efficiency and accuracy.",

We argue this common practice introduces a significant limitation by overlooking a key property of the alignment's reference model: its distributional recall. We show that the standard KD -> Align workflow diminishes the model's capacity to align rare yet desirable behaviors, even under strong preference signals. We instead demonstrate that reversing the pipeline (i.e., Align -> KD) is essential: alignment must first be performed on a high-recall reference before distillation. Our contributions are threefold. First, we provide a minimal working explanation of how the reference model constrains preference alignment objectives at a fundamental level. Second, we validate this theory in a controllable Mixture-of-Gaussians experiment, where low-recall anchoring consistently results in suboptimal model performance. Finally, we demonstrate that the same phenomenon holds in LLM alignment with the SmolLM2 family: models aligned after KD fail to effectively align target behaviors, resulting in substantially lower reward and target precision. In contrast, our proposed Align -> KD pipeline robustly aligns these behaviors, yielding models with superior target-oriented metrics and lower variance. Together, these results establish reference-model recall as a first-order design choice in alignment, offering a clear principle: alignment must precede distillation.",

Most of the early exit strategies greedily exit a sample at an intermediary layer if the confidence in class prediction exceeds a predefined threshold that is set using a static validation set.

        "summary": "Post-hoc calibration methods are widely used to improve the reliability of probabilistic predictions from machine learning models. Despite their prevalence, a comprehensive theoretical understanding of these methods remains elusive, particularly regarding their performance across different datasets and model architectures. Input features play a crucial role in shaping model predictions and, consequently, their calibration. However, the interplay between feature quality and calibration performance has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present a rigorous theoretical analysis of post-hoc calibration methods, focusing on Platt scaling and isotonic regression. We derive convergence guarantees, computational complexity bounds, and finite-sample performance metrics for these methods. Furthermore, we explore the impact of feature informativeness on calibration performance through controlled synthetic experiments. Our empirical evaluation spans a diverse set of real-world datasets and model architectures, demonstrating consistent improvements in calibration metrics across various scenarios. By examining calibration performance under varying feature conditions utilizing only informative features versus complete feature spaces including noise dimensions, we provide fundamental insights into the robustness and reliability of different calibration approaches. Our findings offer practical guidelines for selecting appropriate calibration methods based on dataset characteristics and computational constraints, bridging the gap between theoretical understanding and practical implementation in uncertainty quantification.

Class imbalance is also prevalent in graph-structured data. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically based on the assumption of class balance, often overlooking the issue of class imbalance. In our investigation, we identified a problem, which we term the Randomness Anomalous Connectivity Problem (RACP), where certain off-the-shelf models are affected by random seeds, leading to a significant performance degradation. To eliminate the influence of random factors in algorithms, we proposed PNS (Pure Node Sampling) to address the RACP in the node synthesis stage. Unlike existing approaches that design specialized algorithms to handle either quantity imbalance or topological imbalance, PNS is a novel plug-and-play module that operates directly during node synthesis to mitigate RACP. Moreover, PNS also alleviates performance degradation caused by abnormal distribution of node neighbors. We conduct a series of experiments to identify what factors are influenced by random seeds. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method, which not only eliminates the effect of unfavorable random seeds but also outperforms the baseline across various benchmark datasets with different GNN backbones.

In this paper, we propose a Virtual Nodes based Heterogeneous Graph Convolutional Network (VN-HGCN), which leverages virtual nodes to facilitate enhanced information flow within the graph. Virtual nodes are auxiliary nodes interconnected with all nodes of a specific type in the graph, facilitating efficient aggregation of long-range information across different types of nodes and edges. By incorporating virtual nodes into the graph structure, VN-HGCN achieves effective information aggregation with only $4$ layers. Additionally, we demonstrate that VN-HGCN can serve as a versatile framework that can be seamlessly applied to other HGNN models, showcasing its generalizability. Empirical evaluations validate the effectiveness of VN-HGCN, and extensive experiments conducted on three real-world heterogeneous graph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our model over several state-of-the-art baselines.",

To address this issue, we propose a 3x3 partition that cleanly separates training, validation, and test sets, eliminating leakage and better reflecting real-world applications. Building on this redefined setting, we introduce DRIK, a Distribution-Robust Inductive Kriging approach designed with the intrinsic properties of inductive kriging in mind to explicitly enhance OOD generalization, employing a three-tier strategy at the node, edge, and subgraph levels. DRIK perturbs node coordinates to capture continuous spatial relationships, drops edges to reduce ambiguity in information flow and increase topological diversity, and adds pseudo-labeled subgraphs to strengthen domain generalization.

        "summary": "Time series forecasting remains a critical challenge across numerous domains, yet the effectiveness of complex models often varies unpredictably across datasets. Recent studies highlight the surprising competitiveness of simple linear models, suggesting that their robustness and interpretability warrant deeper theoretical investigation. This paper presents a systematic study of linear models for time series forecasting, with a focus on the role of characteristic roots in temporal dynamics. We begin by analyzing the noise-free setting, where we show that characteristic roots govern long-term behavior and explain how design choices such as instance normalization and channel independence affect model capabilities. We then extend our analysis to the noisy regime, revealing that models tend to produce spurious roots. This leads to the identification of a key data-scaling property: mitigating the influence of noise requires disproportionately large training data, highlighting the need for structural regularization. To address these challenges, we propose two complementary strategies for robust root restructuring. The first uses rank reduction techniques, including Reduced-Rank Regression and Direct Weight Rank Reduction, to recover the low-dimensional latent dynamics. The second, a novel adaptive method called Root Purge, encourages the model to learn a noise-suppressing null space during training. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches, validating our theoretical insights and achieving state-of-the-art results in several settings. Our findings underscore the potential of integrating classical theories for linear systems with modern learning techniques to build robust, interpretable, and data-efficient forecasting models.",

        "summary": "Catastrophic forgetting remains a central obstacle for continual learning in neural models. Popular approaches -- replay and elastic weight consolidation (EWC) -- have limitations: replay requires a strong generator and is prone to distributional drift, while EWC implicitly assumes a shared optimum across tasks and typically uses a diagonal Fisher approximation. In this work, we study the gradient geometry of diffusion models, which can already produce high-quality replay data. We provide theoretical and empirical evidence that, in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, per-sample gradients become strongly collinear, yielding an empirical Fisher that is effectively rank-1 and aligned with the mean gradient. Leveraging this structure, we propose a rank-1 variant of EWC that is as cheap as the diagonal approximation yet captures the dominant curvature direction. We pair this penalty with a replay-based approach to encourage parameter sharing across tasks while mitigating drift. On class-incremental image generation datasets (MNIST, FashionMNIST, CIFAR-10, ImageNet-1k), our method consistently improves average FID and reduces forgetting relative to replay-only and diagonal-EWC baselines. In particular, forgetting is nearly eliminated on MNIST and FashionMNIST and is roughly halved on ImageNet-1k. These results suggest that diffusion models admit an approximately rank-1 Fisher. With a better Fisher estimate, EWC becomes a strong complement to replay: replay encourages parameter sharing across tasks, while EWC effectively constrains replay-induced drift.",

In particular, conventional approaches either maintain a growing list of per-domain task vectors, leading to scalability issues or rely solely on weight-space merging when old data is inaccessible, thereby losing crucial functional information. Our method overcomes these limitations by first fine-tuning the main model within its tangent space on domain-specific data; this linearization amplifies per-task weight disentanglement, effectively mitigating across-task interference. During merging, we leverage functional information from available optimizer states beyond mere parameter averages to avoid the need to revisit old data. Finally, a post-merging correction aligns the representation discrepancy between pre- and post-merged models, reducing bias and enhancing overall performance-all while operating under constant memory constraints without accessing historical data. Extensive experiments on standard class-incremental and domain-incremental benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only achieves competitive performance but also provides a scalable and efficient solution to the catastrophic forgetting problem.",

This work introduces SKETCHLORD, a method that simultaneously estimates both low-rank *and* diagonal components, targeting the broader class of Low-Rank *plus* Diagonal (LoRD) linear operators. We demonstrate theoretically and empirically that this joint estimation is superior also to any sequential variant (diagonal-then-low-rank or low-rank-then-diagonal). Then, we cast SKETCHLORD as a convex optimization problem, leading to a scalable algorithm. Comprehensive experiments on synthetic (approximate) LoRD matrices confirm SKETCHLORD's performance in accurately recovering these structures.

Constraint-based methods aim to recover conditional independence (CI) relations in a causal directed acyclic graph (DAG). Classical approaches such as PC and subsequent methods orient v-structures first and then propagate edge directions from these seeds, assuming perfect CI tests and exhaustive search of separating subsets -- assumptions often violated in practice, leading to cascading errors in the final graph. Recent work has explored using large language models (LLMs) as experts, prompting sets of nodes for edge directions, and could augment edge orientation when assumptions are not met. However, such methods implicitly assume perfect experts, which is unrealistic for hallucination-prone LLMs. We propose MosaCD, a causal discovery method that propagates edges from a high-confidence set of seeds derived from both CI tests and LLM annotations. To filter hallucinations, we introduce shuffled queries that exploit LLMs' positional bias, retaining only high-confidence seeds. We then apply a novel confidence-down propagation strategy that orients the most reliable edges first, and can be integrated with any skeleton-based discovery method. Across multiple real-world graphs, MosaCD achieves higher accuracy in final graph construction than existing constraint-based methods, largely due to the improved reliability of initial seeds and robust propagation strategies.",

While genomic sequencing enables rapid prediction of resistance phenotypes, current computational methods have limitations. Standard machine learning models treat the genome as an unordered collection of features, ignoring the sequential context of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). State-of-the-art sequence models like Transformers are often too data-hungry and computationally expensive for the moderately-sized datasets that are typical in this domain. To address these challenges, we propose AMR-EnsembleNet, an ensemble framework that synergistically combines sequence-based and feature-based learning. We developed a lightweight, custom 1D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to efficiently learn predictive sequence motifs from high-dimensional SNP data. This sequence-aware model was ensembled with an XGBoost model, a powerful gradient boosting system adept at capturing complex, non-local feature interactions. We trained and evaluated our framework on a benchmark dataset of 809 E. coli strains, predicting resistance across four antibiotics with varying class imbalance. Our 1D CNN-XGBoost ensemble consistently achieved top-tier performance across all the antibiotics, reaching a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.926 for Ciprofloxacin (CIP) and the highest Macro F1-score of 0.691 for the challenging Gentamicin (GEN) AMR prediction. We also show that our model consistently focuses on SNPs within well-known AMR genes like fusA and parC, confirming it learns the correct genetic signals for resistance. Our work demonstrates that fusing a sequence-aware 1D CNN with a feature-based XGBoost model creates a powerful ensemble, overcoming the limitations of using either an order-agnostic or a standalone sequence model.",

In this paper, we propose Information-disentangled Multimodal VAE (IDMVAE) to explicitly address this issue, with rigorous mutual information-based regularizations, including cross-view mutual information maximization for extracting shared variables, and a cycle-consistency style loss for redundancy removal using generative augmentations.

Despite progress in both areas, systematic evidence on optimizer-quantization interactions remains limited. To fill this gap, we study the impact of optimizer choice on model robustness under quantization, considering both post-training quantization (PTQ), and quantization-aware training (QAT). We first train full-precision models, ranging from 50M to 1.5B parameters, with six optimizers, to explore the hyperparameter landscape, and establish well-tuned baselines. We then apply PTQ to evaluate how model performance degrades when trained with different optimizers. We find that outlier-related metrics, such as the max-to-mean ratio (MMR) and Kurtosis, fail to predict the PTQ performance across different optimizers. We show analytically that this is due to the MMR capturing only isolated layer errors, while ignoring how quantization errors accumulate and propagate through the network. To study the QAT degradation, we train quantized models from scratch and compare them to our original-precision baselines. We find that optimizers performing well in the original pretraining setup may not remain optimal under QAT, and that models trained with Shampoo show the lowest accuracy degradation. Finally, we derive scaling laws for quantization-aware training under different optimizers, showing that Shampoo achieves the highest parameter efficiency of all tested optimizers.",

        "summary": "Missing values are common in real-world time series, and multivariate time series forecasting with missing values (MTSF-M) has become a crucial area of research for ensuring reliable predictions. To address the challenge of missing data, current approaches have developed an imputation-then-prediction framework that uses imputation modules to fill in missing values, followed by forecasting on the imputed data. However, this framework overlooks a critical issue: there is no ground truth for the missing values, making the imputation process susceptible to errors that can degrade prediction accuracy. In this paper, we conduct a systematic empirical study and reveal that imputation without direct supervision can corrupt the underlying data distribution and actively degrade prediction accuracy. To address this, we propose a paradigm shift that moves away from imputation and directly predicts from the partially observed time series. We introduce Consistency-Regularized Information Bottleneck (CRIB), a novel framework built on the Information Bottleneck principle. CRIB combines a unified-variate attention mechanism with a consistency regularization scheme to learn robust representations that filter out noise introduced by missing values while preserving essential predictive signals. Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CRIB, which predicts accurately even under high missing rates.

Our analysis shows that incorporating group-invariant structures introduces a group-dependent factor $\\delta_{G,\\Gamma,\\sigma} \\le 1$ into the approximation rate. When this factor is small, group invariance yields substantial improvements in approximation accuracy. On the estimation side, we establish that the Rademacher complexity of the group-invariant class is no larger than that of the non-invariant counterpart, implying that the estimation error remains unaffected by the incorporation of symmetry. Consequently, the generalization error can improve significantly when learning functions with inherent group symmetries. We further provide illustrative examples demonstrating both favorable cases, where $\\delta_{G,\\Gamma,\\sigma}\\approx |G|^{-1}$, and unfavorable ones, where $\\delta_{G,\\Gamma,\\sigma}\\approx 1$. Overall, our results offer a rigorous theoretical foundation showing that encoding group-invariant structures in neural networks leads to clear statistical advantages for symmetric target functions.",

        "summary": "The parameter-efficient fine-tuning paradigm has garnered significant attention with the advancement of foundation models. Although numerous methods have been proposed to reduce the number of trainable parameters, their substantial memory overhead remains a critical bottleneck that hinders practical deployment. In this paper, we observe that model activations constitute a major source of memory consumption, especially under large batch sizes and long context lengths; however, the rank of the activations remains consistently low. Motivated by this insight, we propose a memory-efficient fine-tuning approach Low-Rank Activation Compression (LoRAct). Unlike prior work, LoRAct provides a more flexible and versatile compressing strategy that can be applied online during the forward pass without the need for any calibration data. Moreover, LoRAct incorporates a novel sampling-based orthogonal decomposition algorithm specifically designed for low-rank matrices, offering improved computational efficiency and a tighter error bound compared to the widely used RSVD. Experiments on both vision and language tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of LoRAct. Notably, LoRAct further reduces activation memory by approximately 80% in comparison with the widely adopted LoRA method, while maintaining competitive performance.

This paper presents Drift-Adapter, a lightweight, learnable transformation layer designed to bridge embedding spaces between model versions. By mapping new queries into the legacy embedding space, Drift-Adapter enables the continued use of the existing ANN index, effectively deferring full re-computation. We systematically evaluate three adapter parameterizations: Orthogonal Procrustes, Low-Rank Affine, and a compact Residual MLP, trained on a small sample of paired old and new embeddings. Experiments on MTEB text corpora and a CLIP image model upgrade (1M items) show that Drift-Adapter recovers 95-99% of the retrieval recall (Recall@10, MRR) of a full re-embedding, adding less than 10 microseconds of query latency. Compared to operational strategies like full re-indexing or dual-index serving, Drift-Adapter reduces recompute costs by over 100 times and facilitates upgrades with near-zero operational interruption. We analyze robustness to varied model drift, training data size, scalability to billion-item systems, and the impact of design choices like diagonal scaling, demonstrating Drift-Adapter's viability as a pragmatic solution for agile model deployment.",

        "summary": "A common challenge in real-time operations is deciding whether to re-solve an optimization problem or continue using an existing solution. While modern data platforms may collect information at high frequencies, many real-time operations require repeatedly solving computationally intensive optimization problems formulated as Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs). Determining when to re-solve is, therefore, an economically important question. This problem poses several challenges: 1) How to characterize solution optimality and solving cost; 2) How to detect environmental changes and select beneficial samples for solving the MILP; 3) Given the large time horizon and non-MDP structure, vanilla reinforcement learning (RL) methods are not directly applicable and tend to suffer from value function explosion. Existing literature largely focuses on heuristics, low-data settings, and smooth objectives, with little focus on common NP-hard MILPs. We propose a framework called Proximal Policy Optimization with Change Point Detection (POC), which systematically offers a solution for balancing performance and cost when deciding appropriate re-solving times. Theoretically, we establish the relationship between the number of re-solves and the re-solving cost. To test our framework, we assemble eight synthetic and real-world datasets, and show that POC consistently outperforms existing baselines by 2%-17%. As a side benefit, our work fills the gap in the literature by introducing real-time MILP benchmarks and evaluation criteria.",

Existing population-based methods, like Policy-Space Response Oracles, PSRO, require storing explicit policy populations and constructing full payoff matrices, incurring quadratic computation and linear memory costs. We present Generative Evolutionary Meta-Solver (GEMS), a surrogate-free framework that replaces explicit populations with a compact set of latent anchors and a single amortized generator. Instead of exhaustively constructing the payoff matrix, GEMS relies on unbiased Monte Carlo rollouts, multiplicative-weights meta-dynamics, and a model-free empirical-Bernstein UCB oracle to adaptively expand the policy set. Best responses are trained within the generator using an advantage-based trust-region objective, eliminating the need to store and train separate actors. We evaluated GEMS in a variety of Two-player and Multi-Player games such as the Deceptive Messages Game, Kuhn Poker and Multi-Particle environment. We find that GEMS is up to ~6x faster, has 1.3x less memory usage than PSRO, while also reaps higher rewards simultaneously. These results demonstrate that GEMS retains the game theoretic guarantees of PSRO, while overcoming its fundamental inefficiencies, hence enabling scalable multi-agent learning in multiple domains.",

We validate PHASE on the biogeochemical (BGC) spin-up workflow of the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) Land Model (ELM), presenting-to our knowledge-the first scientifically validated AI-accelerated solution for this task. Using only the first 20 simulation years, PHASE infers a near-equilibrium state that otherwise requires more than 1,200 years of integration, yielding an effective reduction in required integration length by at least 60x. The framework is enabled by a pipeline for fusing heterogeneous scientific data and demonstrates strong generalization to higher spatial resolutions with minimal fine-tuning. These results indicate that PHASE captures governing physical regularities rather than surface correlations, enabling practical, physically consistent acceleration of land-surface modeling and other complex scientific workflows.",

Approximations such as Generalised Gauss-Newton (GGN) and Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (K-FAC) have been proposed to make influence computation tractable, yet it remains unclear how the departure from exactness impacts data attribution performance. Critically, given the restricted regime in which influence functions are derived, it is not necessarily clear better Hessian approximations should even lead to better data attribution performance. In this paper, we investigate the effect of Hessian approximation quality on influence-function attributions in a controlled classification setting. Our experiments show that better Hessian approximations consistently yield better influence score quality, offering justification for recent research efforts towards that end. We further decompose the approximation steps for recent Hessian approximation methods and evaluate each step's influence on attribution accuracy. Notably, the mismatch between K-FAC eigenvalues and GGN/EK-FAC eigenvalues accounts for the majority of the error and influence loss. These findings highlight which approximations are most critical, guiding future efforts to balance computational tractability and attribution accuracy.",

        "summary": "Transformers have proven highly effective across a wide range of modalities. However, the quadratic complexity of the standard softmax attention mechanism poses a fundamental barrier to scaling them to long context windows. A large body of work addresses this with linear attention, which reformulates attention as a kernel function and approximates it with finite feature maps to achieve linear-time computation. Orthogonal to computational scaling, most attention mechanisms -- both quadratic and linear -- produce row-normalized maps that can over-focus on a few tokens, degrading robustness and information flow. Enforcing doubly-stochastic attention alleviates this by balancing token participation across rows and columns, but existing doubly-stochastic attention mechanisms typically introduce substantial overhead, undermining scalability. We propose LOTFormer, a principled attention mechanism that is simultaneously linear-time and doubly-stochastic. Our approach exploits the connection between attention maps and transportation plans between query and key measures. The central idea is to constrain the transport plan to be low-rank by conditioning it on a learnable pivot measure with small support. Concretely, we solve two entropic optimal transport problems (queries $\\to$ pivot and pivot $\\to$ keys) and compose them into a conditional (glued) coupling. This yields an attention matrix that is provably doubly-stochastic, has rank at most $r \\ll n$, and applies to values in $O(nr)$ time without forming the full $n \\times n$ map. The pivot locations and masses are learned end-to-end. Empirically, LOTFormer achieves state-of-the-art results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, surpassing prior linear and transport-based attention methods in both accuracy and efficiency.",

However, existing neural solvers typically rely on predefined problem constraints or require per-problem fine-tuning, which substantially limits their zero-shot generalization ability to unseen VRP variants. To address this critical bottleneck, we propose URS, a unified neural routing solver capable of zero-shot generalization across a wide range of unseen VRPs using a single model without any fine-tuning. The key component of URS is the unified data representation (UDR), which replaces problem enumeration with data unification, thereby broadening the problem coverage and reducing reliance on domain expertise. In addition, we propose a Mixed Bias Module (MBM) to efficiently learn the geometric and relational biases inherent in various problems. On top of the proposed UDR, we further develop a parameter generator that adaptively adjusts the decoder and bias weights of MBM to enhance zero-shot generalization. Moreover, we propose an LLM-driven constraint satisfaction mechanism, which translates raw problem descriptions into executable stepwise masking functions to ensure solution feasibility. Extensive experiments demonstrate that URS can consistently produce high-quality solutions for more than 100 distinct VRP variants without any fine-tuning, which includes more than 90 unseen variants. To the best of our knowledge, URS is the first neural solver capable of handling over 100 VRP variants with a single model.",

To bridge this gap, we introduce PATCH, a hybrid sparsity framework that enables a continuous sparsity ratio between 0% and 50%. PATCH partitions weight matrices into tiles, assigning each tile to be either dense or 2:4 sparse via a learnable mask selection mechanism. This design provides fine-grained control over accuracy-acceleration tradeoffs and supports non-uniform sparsity across layers, leading to superior overall quality. Across models from 0.5B to 8B parameters, PATCH consistently narrows the gap to dense accuracy while delivering practical speedups. For instance, on LLaMA-2 7B with an A6000 GPU, PATCH achieves 1.18x-1.38x end-to-end speedup over dense baselines while improving accuracy by 0.37%-2.96% compared to the state-of-the-art 2:4 pruning method, MaskLLM.",

        "summary": "Diffusion language models have emerged as a powerful alternative to autoregressive models, enabling fast inference through flexible and parallel generation paths. This flexibility is enabled by new sampling strategies, or planners, that iteratively choose where to denoise along the sequence rather than sampling uniformly at random. However, by modifying reverse paths, planners introduce a mismatch between the uniformly random denoising paths used during training and the planning-based paths used at inference. In this work, we systematically investigate this mismatch and theoretically show that the standard discrete diffusion training evidence lower bound (ELBO) does not accurately describe a denoiser under non-uniform planning. To bridge this gap, we derive a new Planned Evidence Lower Bound (P-ELBO) that directly incorporates planner-based reverse dynamics into the training objective. Building on this, we propose Planner Aware Path Learning (PAPL), a simple and effective modification of the standard masked discrete diffusion loss that aligns training and inference under planned denoisers. Empirically, PAPL delivers consistent improvements across domains, including a 40% relative gain in protein sequence modeling, up to a 4x improvement in MAUVE for text generation, and a 23% relative gain in HumanEval pass@10 for code generation.",

        "summary": "Previous work shows that the chain of continuous thought (continuous CoT) improves the reasoning capability of large language models (LLMs) by enabling implicit parallel thinking, and a subsequent work provided theoretical insight by showing that a two-layer transformer equipped with continuous CoT can efficiently solve directed graph reachability by maintaining a superposition of multiple reasoning traces in the continuous thought. However, it remains unclear how the superposition mechanism is naturally learned from gradient-based training methods. To fill this gap, we theoretically analyze the training dynamics of a simplified two-layer transformer on the directed graph reachability problem to unveil how the superposition mechanism emerges during training in two training stages -- (i) a thought-generation stage that autoregressively expands the continuous thought, and (ii) a prediction stage that converts the thought into the final answer. Our analysis reveals that during training using continuous thought, the index-matching logit, an important quantity which reflects the strength of the model's local search ability, will first increase and then remain bounded under mild assumptions. The bounded index-matching logit effectively balances exploration and exploitation during the reasoning process: the model will exploit local problem structures to identify plausible search traces, and assign comparable weights to multiple such traces to explore when it is uncertain about which solution is correct, which results in superposition. Our experimental results tracking the growth of logits further validate our theory.",

We study the problem of Riemannian optimization over such manifolds when they are given only implicitly through the data distribution, and the standard manifold operations required by classical algorithms are unavailable. This formulation captures a broad class of data-driven design problems that are central to modern generative AI. Our key idea is to introduce a link function that connects the data distribution to the geometric operations needed for optimization. We show that this function enables the recovery of essential manifold operations, such as retraction and Riemannian gradient computation. Moreover, we establish a direct connection between our construction and the score function in diffusion models of the data distribution. This connection allows us to leverage well-studied parameterizations, efficient training procedures, and even pretrained score networks from the diffusion model literature to perform optimization. Building on this foundation, we propose two efficient inference-time algorithms -- Denoising Landing Flow (DLF) and Denoising Riemannian Gradient Descent (DRGD) -- and provide theoretical guarantees for both feasibility (approximate manifold adherence) and optimality (small Riemannian gradient norm). Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on finite-horizon reference tracking tasks in data-driven control, highlighting its potential for practical generative and design applications.",

We address this challenge by introducing a benchmark for SB on discrete spaces. Our construction yields pairs of probability distributions with analytically known SB solutions, enabling rigorous evaluation. As a byproduct of building this benchmark, we obtain two new SB algorithms, DLightSB and DLightSB-M, and additionally extend prior related work to construct the $\\alpha$-CSBM algorithm.

While causal representation learning (CRL) offers theoretically grounded approaches for uncovering latent concepts, existing methods cannot scale to LLMs' rich conceptual space due to inefficient computation. To bridge the gap, we introduce an identifiable temporal causal representation learning framework specifically designed for LLMs' high-dimensional concept space, capturing both time-delayed and instantaneous causal relations. Our approach provides theoretical guarantees and demonstrates efficacy on synthetic datasets scaled to match real-world complexity. By extending SAE techniques with our temporal causal framework, we successfully discover meaningful concept relationships in LLM activations.

However, the asynchronous sampling and irregular intervals inherent to IMTS pose two core challenges for existing methods: (1) how to accurately represent the raw information of irregular time series without introducing data distortion, and (2) how to effectively capture the complex dynamic dependencies between observation points. To address these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Spatio-Temporal Graph Interaction (ASTGI) framework. Specifically, the framework first employs a Spatio-Temporal Point Representation module to encode each discrete observation as a point within a learnable spatio-temporal embedding space. Second, a Neighborhood-Adaptive Graph Construction module adaptively builds a causal graph for each point in the embedding space via nearest neighbor search. Subsequently, a Spatio-Temporal Dynamic Propagation module iteratively updates information on these adaptive causal graphs by generating messages and computing interaction weights based on the relative spatio-temporal positions between points. Finally, a Query Point-based Prediction module generates the final forecast by aggregating neighborhood information for a new query point and performing regression. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ASTGI outperforms various state-of-the-art methods.",

Recently trials have predominantly focused on genomic prognostication tools, even though clinicopathological prognostication is less costly and more widely accessible. Machine learning (ML), transfer learning and ensemble integration offer opportunities to build robust prognostication frameworks. We evaluate this potential to improve survival prognostication in breast cancer by comparing de-novo ML, transfer learning from a pre-trained prognostic tool and ensemble integration. Data from the MA.27 trial was used for model training, with external validation on the TEAM trial and a SEER cohort. Transfer learning was applied by fine-tuning the pre-trained prognostic tool PREDICT v3, de-novo ML included Random Survival Forests and Extreme Gradient Boosting, and ensemble integration was realized through a weighted sum of model predictions. Transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration improved calibration in MA.27 over the pre-trained model (ICI reduced from 0.042 in PREDICT v3 to <=0.007) while discrimination remained comparable (AUC increased from 0.738 in PREDICT v3 to 0.744-0.799). Invalid PREDICT v3 predictions were observed in 23.8-25.8% of MA.27 individuals due to missing information. In contrast, ML models and ensemble integration could predict survival regardless of missing information. Across all models, patient age, nodal status, pathological grading and tumor size had the highest SHAP values, indicating their importance for survival prognostication. External validation in SEER, but not in TEAM, confirmed the benefits of transfer learning, RSF and ensemble integration. This study demonstrates that transfer learning, de-novo RSF, and ensemble integration can improve prognostication in situations where relevant information for PREDICT v3 is lacking or where a dataset shift is likely.",

        "summary": "It is often possible to perform reduced order modelling by specifying linear subspace which accurately captures the dynamics of the system. This approach becomes especially appealing when linear subspace explicitly depends on parameters of the problem. A practical way to apply such a scheme is to compute subspaces for a selected set of parameters in the computationally demanding offline stage and in the online stage approximate subspace for unknown parameters by interpolation. For realistic problems the space of parameters is high dimensional, which renders classical interpolation strategies infeasible or unreliable. We propose to relax the interpolation problem to regression, introduce several loss functions suitable for subspace data, and use a neural network as an approximation to high-dimensional target function. To further simplify a learning problem we introduce redundancy: in place of predicting subspace of a given dimension we predict larger subspace. We show theoretically that this strategy decreases the complexity of the mapping for elliptic eigenproblems with constant coefficients and makes the mapping smoother for general smooth function on the Grassmann manifold. Empirical results also show that accuracy significantly improves when larger-than-needed subspaces are predicted. With the set of numerical illustrations we demonstrate that subspace regression can be useful for a range of tasks including parametric eigenproblems, deflation techniques, relaxation methods, optimal control and solution of parametric partial differential equations.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) frequently memorize sensitive or personal information, raising significant privacy concerns. Existing variants of differential privacy stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) inject uniform noise into every gradient step, significantly extending training time and reducing model accuracy. We propose that concentrating noise primarily on gradients associated with sensitive tokens can substantially decrease DP training time, strengthen the protection of sensitive information, and simultaneously preserve the model's performance on non-sensitive data. We operationalize this insight through Adaptive Token-Weighted Differential Privacy (ATDP), a modification of vanilla DP-SGD that adaptively assigns different gradient weights to sensitive and non-sensitive tokens. By employing a larger noise scale at the early stage of training, ATDP rapidly disrupts memorization of sensitive content. As a result, ATDP only requires a few additional epochs of lightweight post-processing following standard fine-tuning, injecting targeted noise primarily on parameters corresponding to sensitive tokens, thus minimally affecting the model's general capabilities. ATDP can be seamlessly integrated into any existing DP-based fine-tuning pipeline or directly applied to non-private models as a fast privacy-enhancing measure. Additionally, combined with an initial redacted fine-tuning phase, ATDP forms a streamlined DP pipeline that achieves comparable canary protection to state-of-the-art DP-SGD methods, significantly reduces the computational overhead of DP fine-tuning, shortening training time by approximately 90 percent, while achieving comparable or superior privacy protection and minimal accuracy degradation.",

In wireless communications, where problems require precise manipulation of information-theoretic bounds, optimization constraints, and signal processing formulations, even state-of-the-art models struggle to achieve competent performance. We present WirelessMathLM, demonstrating that compact models (0.5B-7B parameters) can match or exceed much larger models through domain-specific reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. Our key insight is that wireless mathematics problems possess a unique property--verifiable correctness--that enables effective reinforcement learning without human feedback. We construct WirelessMathBench-XL, a comprehensive benchmark of 4,027 problems from 970 papers. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with binary verification rewards, we train models directly from base checkpoints without supervised warm-start. Our 7B model achieves 39.5% accuracy on WirelessMathBench-XL, approaching GPT-4o (40.4%) while using about 100 times fewer parameters than DeepSeek-R1 (671B, 57.4%). Remarkably, GRPO training nearly doubles performance across all model scales (0.5B +11%, 3B +103%, 7B +81%), with positive transfer to general mathematics benchmarks--our models gain +8.4 points on average across MATH, Minerva-Math, OlympiadBench, AMC, and AIME without any training on these tasks.",

        "summary": "In-Context Reinforcement Learning (ICRL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing agents that can rapidly adapt to new tasks by leveraging past experiences as context, without updating their parameters. Recent approaches train large sequence models on monotonic policy improvement data from online RL, aiming to a continue improved testing time performance. However, our experimental analysis reveals a critical flaw: these models cannot show a continue improvement like the training data during testing time. Theoretically, we identify this phenomenon as Contextual Ambiguity, where the model's own stochastic actions can generate an interaction history that misleadingly resembles that of a sub-optimal policy from the training data, initiating a vicious cycle of poor action selection. To resolve the Contextual Ambiguity, we introduce Context Value into training phase and propose Context Value Informed ICRL (CV-ICRL). CV-ICRL use Context Value as an explicit signal representing the ideal performance theoretically achievable by a policy given the current context. As the context expands, Context Value could include more task-relevant information, and therefore the ideal performance should be non-decreasing. We prove that the Context Value tightens the lower bound on the performance gap relative to an ideal, monotonically improving policy. We fruther propose two methods for estimating Context Value at both training and testing time. Experiments conducted on the Dark Room and Minigrid testbeds demonstrate that CV-ICRL effectively mitigates performance degradation and improves overall ICRL abilities across various tasks and environments.

        "summary": "The recent hardware-accelerated microscaling 4-bit floating-point formats such as MXFP4 and NVFP4, supported on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, promise to revolutionize large language model (LLM) inference. Yet, their practical benefits remain unproven. We present the first comprehensive study of MXFP4 and NVFP4 for post-training quantization, revealing gaps between their promise and real-world performance. Our analysis shows that state-of-the-art methods struggle with FP4, due to two key issues: (1) NVFP4's small group size provably neutralizes traditional outlier mitigation techniques; (2) MXFP4's power-of-two scale quantization severely degrades accuracy due to high induced error. To bridge this gap, we introduce Micro-Rotated-GPTQ (MR-GPTQ), a variant of the classic GPTQ quantization algorithm that tailors the quantization process to FP4's unique properties, by using block-wise Hadamard transforms and format-specific optimizations. We support our proposal with a set of high-performance GPU kernels that enable the MR-GPTQ format with negligible overhead, by rotation fusion into the weights, and fast online computation of the activations. This leads to speedups vs. FP16 of up to 3.6x layer-wise, and 2.2x end-to-end on NVIDIA B200, and of 6x layer-wise and 4x end-to-end on RTX5090. Our extensive empirical evaluation demonstrates that MR-GPTQ matches or outperforms state-of-the-art accuracy, significantly boosting MXFP4, to the point where it nears that of NVFP4. We conclude that, while FP4 is not an automatic upgrade over INT4, format-specialized methods like MR-GPTQ can unlock a new frontier of accuracy-performance trade-offs.",

Motivated by these considerations, we propose CoSIFL, a novel framework that integrates proactive alarming for robust security and local differential privacy (LDP) for inference attacks, together with a Stackelberg-based incentive scheme to encourage client participation and data sharing. Specifically, CoSIFL uses an active alarming mechanism and robust aggregation to defend against Byzantine and inference attacks, while a Tullock contest-inspired incentive module rewards honest clients for both data contributions and reliable alarm triggers. We formulate the interplay between the server and clients as a two-stage game: in the first stage, the server determines total rewards, selects participants, and fixes global iteration settings, whereas in the second stage, each client decides its mini-batch size, privacy noise scale, and alerting strategy. We prove that the server-client game admits a unique equilibrium, and analyze how clients' multi-dimensional attributes - such as non-IID degrees and privacy budgets - jointly affect system efficiency. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoSIFL outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in improving model robustness and reducing total server costs, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated design.",

However, pure entropy minimization can favor non-generalizable shortcuts, such as inflating the logit norm and driving all predictions to a dominant class to reduce entropy, risking collapsed solutions (e.g., constant one-hot outputs) that trivially minimize the objective without meaningful learning. In this paper, we introduce ZeroSiam, an efficient asymmetric Siamese architecture tailored for test-time entropy minimization. ZeroSiam prevents collapse through asymmetric divergence alignment, which is efficiently achieved by a learnable predictor and a stop-gradient operator before the classifier. We provide empirical and theoretical evidence that ZeroSiam not only prevents collapse solutions, but also absorbs and regularizes biased learning signals, enhancing performance even when no collapse occurs. Despite its simplicity, extensive results show that ZeroSiam performs more stably over prior methods using negligible overhead, demonstrating efficacy on both vision adaptation and large language model reasoning tasks across challenging test scenarios and diverse models, including tiny models that are particularly collapse-prone.",

We conduct the first systematic study of PEFT for pre-trained Large Operator Models (LOMs) obtained by scaling variants of Fourier Neural Operator. First, we observe that the widely used Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) yields markedly poorer performance on LOMs than Adapter tuning. Then, we further theoretically establish that stacked LoRA incurs a depth-amplified lower bound on approximation error within Fourier layers, whereas adapters retain universal approximation capacity and, by concentrating parameters on energy-dominant low-frequency modes, attain exponentially decaying error with bottleneck width in the Fourier domain. Motivated by the robust empirical gains of adapters and by our theoretical characterization of PDE solutions as spectrally sparse, we introduce Frequency-Adaptive Adapter (F-Adapter). F-Adapter allocates adapter capacity based on spectral complexity, assigning higher-dimension modules to low-frequency components and lower-dimension modules to high-frequency components. Our F-Adapters establish state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple challenging 3D Navier-Stokes benchmarks, markedly enhancing both generalization and spectral fidelity over LoRA and other PEFT techniques commonly used in LLMs. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to explore PEFT for scientific machine-learning and establishes F-Adapter as an effective paradigm for this domain.",

We propose ProtoTS, a novel interpretable forecasting framework that achieves both high accuracy and transparent decision-making through modeling prototypical temporal patterns. ProtoTS computes instance-prototype similarity based on a denoised representation that preserves abundant heterogeneous information. The prototypes are organized hierarchically to capture global temporal patterns with coarse prototypes while capturing finer-grained local variations with detailed prototypes, enabling expert steering and multi-level interpretability. Experiments on multiple realistic benchmarks, including a newly released LOF dataset, show that ProtoTS not only exceeds existing methods in forecast accuracy but also delivers expert-steerable interpretations for better model understanding and decision support.",

Our key contributions are two techniques to enhance model generalizability across participants: (1) routine-aware augmentation, which generates synthetic sequences by replacing each day with behaviorally similar alternatives, and (2) demographic personalization, which reweights training samples to emphasize those from individuals demographically similar to the test participant. Evaluated on 6-month data from 36 older adults, these techniques jointly improved the Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) of the model trained on sensing and demographic features from 0.637 to 0.766, highlighting the potential of scalable monitoring of cognitive impairment in aging populations with passive sensing.",

To aid the adoption of direct DFT signals in the materials design loop through online reinforcement learning (RL), we propose CrystalGym, an open-source RL environment for crystalline material discovery. Using CrystalGym, we benchmark common value- and policy-based reinforcement learning algorithms for designing various crystals conditioned on target properties. Concretely, we optimize for challenging properties like the band gap, bulk modulus, and density, which are directly calculated from DFT in the environment. While none of the algorithms we benchmark solve all CrystalGym tasks, our extensive experiments and ablations show different sample efficiencies and ease of convergence to optimality for different algorithms and environment settings. Additionally, we include a case study on the scope of fine-tuning large language models with reinforcement learning for improving DFT-based rewards. Our goal is for CrystalGym to serve as a test bed for reinforcement learning researchers and material scientists to address these real-world design problems with practical applications.

We argue that this limitation stems from a lack of informative critique signals during verifier training. To bridge this gap, we introduce Mirror-Critique, a framework that trains a verifier with informative critiques. Our key insight is to leverage the rich critique signal by contrasting model-generated solutions with ground-truth solutions. We deploy a small instruction-tuned model to synthesize high-quality critique data with rejection sampling that teaches the verifier not only what is wrong, but also why. The synthetic data is used to cold-start the LLMs in the RLVR process to further improve the verification ability. The resulting Mirror-Verifier is deployed to evaluate candidate solutions by generating multiple critiques per solution, aggregating them into a verify score used for weighted voting or selective abstention. The experimental results show that our Mirror-Verifier significantly outperforms majority voting in terms of solution accuracy and also improves the solver's honesty to recognize and abstain from answering beyond its capability boundaries.",

To resolve these problems, we propose the Temporal Mix of Experts (TMOE), a novel attention-level mechanism that reimagines key-value (K-V) pairs as local experts (each specialized in a distinct temporal context) and performs adaptive expert selection for each query via localized filtering of irrelevant timestamps. Complementing this local adaptation, a shared global expert preserves the Transformer's strength in capturing long-range dependencies. We then replace the vanilla attention mechanism in popular time-series Transformer frameworks (i.e., PatchTST and Timer) with TMOE, without extra structural modifications, yielding our specific version TimeExpert and general version TimeExpert-G.

We first present a unified view showing canonical non-adversarial methods explicitly or implicitly maximize the likelihood of expert behavior, which is equivalent to minimizing the expected return gap. This insight leads to our main contribution: Trust Region Reward Optimization (TRRO), a framework that guarantees monotonic improvement in this likelihood via a Minorization-Maximization process.

Its mask-aware objective builds trajectories only on missing entries while constraining predicted velocity to remain near zero on observed entries, using flexible nonlinear schedules. Impute-MACFM combines: (i) stability penalties on observed positions, (ii) consistency regularization enforcing local invariance, and (iii) time-decayed noise injection for numeric features. Inference uses constraint-preserving ordinary differential equation integration with per-step projection to fix observed values, optionally aggregating multiple trajectories for robustness. Across diverse benchmarks, Impute-MACFM achieves state-of-the-art results while delivering more robust, efficient, and higher-quality imputation than competing approaches, establishing flow matching as a promising direction for tabular missing-data problems, including longitudinal data.",

Like AdamW, Muon is stateful, requiring storage of both model weights and accumulated gradients. While 8-bit AdamW variants mitigate this overhead using blockwise quantization, they are typically stable only under dynamic quantization - which improves stability on linear quantization for extreme values. In this paper, we introduce the 8-bit Muon optimizer using blockwise quantization, supporting both linear and dynamic schemes. We demonstrate that 8-bit Muon maintains stability under both, while delivering $\\sim$74\\% reduction in memory footprint compared to full-precision Muon. In extensive experiments, 8-bit Muon closely matches the performance of Muon while outperforming AdamW and 8-bit AdamW in pre-training a 1.6B model on 4B FineWeb tokens. It also shows competitive results when fine-tuning the Llama 3.2 3B model on post-training data. We also provide a theoretical perspective to help explain this robustness under quantization.",

In this work, we propose an ensemble framework that integrates Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT), and Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) to enhance blockchain fraud detection. Using the real-world Elliptic dataset, our tuned soft voting ensemble achieves high recall of illicit transactions while maintaining a false positive rate below 1%, beating individual GNN models and baseline methods. The modular architecture incorporates quantum-ready design hooks, allowing seamless future integration of quantum feature mappings and hybrid quantum classical graph neural networks. This ensures scalability, robustness, and long-term adaptability as quantum computing technologies mature.

However, the full potential of these expressive actors is often bottlenecked by their critics, which typically learn a single, scalar estimate of the expected return. To address this limitation, we introduce the Distributional Flow Critic (DFC), a novel critic architecture that learns the complete state-action return distribution. Instead of regressing to a single value, DFC employs flow matching to model the distribution of return as a continuous, flexible transformation from a simple base distribution to the complex target distribution of returns. By doing so, DFC provides the expressive flow-based policy with a rich, distributional Bellman target, which offers a more stable and informative learning signal. Extensive experiments across D4RL and OGBench benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves strong performance, especially on tasks requiring multimodal action distributions, and excels in both offline and offline-to-online fine-tuning compared to existing methods.",

We address this by defining an odd sigmoid function class and, given any activation f in this class, proposing an initialization method tailored to f. The method selects a noise scale in closed form so that forward activations remain well dispersed up to a target layer, thereby avoiding collapse to zero or saturation. Empirically, the approach trains reliably without normalization layers, exhibits strong data efficiency, and enables learning for activations under which standard initialization methods (Xavier, He, Orthogonal) often do not converge reliably.",

        "summary": "The rise of deep learning has greatly advanced human behavior monitoring using wearable sensors, particularly human activity recognition (HAR). While deep models have been widely studied, most assume stationary data distributions - an assumption often violated in real-world scenarios. For example, sensor data from one subject may differ significantly from another, leading to distribution shifts. In continual learning, this shift is framed as a sequence of tasks, each corresponding to a new subject. Such settings suffer from catastrophic forgetting, where prior knowledge deteriorates as new tasks are learned. This challenge is compounded by the scarcity and inconsistency of labeled data in human studies. To address these issues, we propose CLAD-Net (Continual Learning with Attention and Distillation), a framework enabling wearable-sensor models to be updated continuously without sacrificing performance on past tasks. CLAD-Net integrates a self-supervised transformer, acting as long-term memory, with a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained via knowledge distillation for activity classification. The transformer captures global activity patterns through cross-attention across body-mounted sensors, learning generalizable representations without labels. Meanwhile, the CNN leverages knowledge distillation to retain prior knowledge during subject-wise fine-tuning. On PAMAP2, CLAD-Net achieves 91.36 percent final accuracy with only 8.78 percent forgetting, surpassing memory-based and regularization-based baselines such as Experience Replay and Elastic Weight Consolidation. In semi-supervised settings with only 10-20 percent labeled data, CLAD-Net still delivers strong performance, demonstrating robustness to label scarcity. Ablation studies further validate each module's contribution.",

However, this approach suffers from a fundamental flaw: standard evaluation metrics conflate a model's performance with the data's intrinsic unpredictability. To address this pressing challenge, we introduce a novel, predictability-aligned diagnostic framework grounded in spectral coherence. Our framework makes two primary contributions: the Spectral Coherence Predictability (SCP), a computationally efficient ($O(N\\log N)$) and task-aligned score that quantifies the inherent difficulty of a given forecasting instance, and the Linear Utilization Ratio (LUR), a frequency-resolved diagnostic tool that precisely measures how effectively a model exploits the linearly predictable information within the data. We validate our framework's effectiveness and leverage it to reveal two core insights. First, we provide the first systematic evidence of \"predictability drift\", demonstrating that a task's forecasting difficulty varies sharply over time. Second, our evaluation reveals a key architectural trade-off: complex models are superior for low-predictability data, whereas linear models are highly effective on more predictable tasks. We advocate for a paradigm shift, moving beyond simplistic aggregate scores toward a more insightful, predictability-aware evaluation that fosters fairer model comparisons and a deeper understanding of model behavior.",

It leverages training runs from a hyperparameter search to learn a latent representation of the training process. Given current training metrics, it predicts the future learning rate schedule with the best long-term validation performance. Our scheduler generalizes beyond previously observed training dynamics and creates specialized schedules that deviate noticeably from common parametric functions. It achieves SOTA results for image classification with CNN and ResNet models as well as for next-token prediction with a transformer model. The trained models are located in flatter regions of the loss landscape and thus provide better generalization than those trained with other schedules. Our method is computationally efficient, optimizer-agnostic, and can easily be layered on top of ML experiment-tracking platforms. An implementation of our scheduler will be made available after acceptance.",

To address this gap, we present the first systematic analysis of language prior through the lens of chain-of-embedding, which examines the layer-wise representation dynamics within LVLMs. Our analysis reveals a universal phenomenon: each model exhibits a Visual Integration Point (VIP), a critical layer at which visual information begins to meaningfully reshape hidden representations and influence decoding. Building on this observation, we introduce the Total Visual Integration (TVI) estimator, which aggregates representation distance beyond the VIP to quantify how strongly visual query influences response generation. Across 54 model-dataset combinations spanning 9 contemporary LVLMs and 6 benchmarks, we demonstrate that VIP consistently emerges, and that TVI reliably predicts the strength of language prior. This offers a principled toolkit for diagnosing and understanding language prior in LVLMs.",

A fundamental challenge in these systems is statistical heterogeneity-the fact that data distributions vary significantly across clients (e.g., different hospitals may treat distinct patient demographics). While current FL algorithms focus on aggregating model updates from these heterogeneous clients, the potential of the central server remains under-explored. This paper is motivated by a healthcare scenario: could a central server not only build a model but also guide a new patient to the hospital best equipped for their specific condition? We generalize this idea to propose a novel paradigm for FL systems where the server actively guides the allocation of new tasks or queries to the most appropriate client in the network. To enable this, we introduce an empirical likelihood-based framework that simultaneously addresses two goals: (1) learning effective local models on each client, and (2) finding the best matching client for a new query. Empirical results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness on benchmark datasets, showing improvements in both model accuracy and the precision of client guidance compared to standard FL approaches. This work opens a new direction for building more intelligent and resource-efficient federated systems that leverage heterogeneity as a feature, not just a bug.

Parallel Tempering (PT) improves mixing by swapping replicas across temperatures, yet each replica still relies on slow local updates to change its configuration. We introduce IsingFormer, a Transformer trained on equilibrium samples that can generate entire spin configurations resembling those from the target distribution. These uncorrelated samples are used as proposals for global moves within a Metropolis step in PT, complementing the usual single-spin flips. On 2D Ising models (sampling), IsingFormer reproduces magnetization and free-energy curves and generalizes to unseen temperatures, including the critical region. Injecting even a single proposal sharply reduces equilibration time, replacing thousands of local updates. On 3D spin glasses (optimization), PT enhanced with IsingFormer finds substantially lower-energy states, demonstrating how global moves accelerate search in rugged landscapes. Finally, applied to integer factorization encoded as Ising problems, IsingFormer trained on a limited set of semiprimes transfers successfully to unseen semiprimes, boosting success rates beyond the training distribution. Since factorization is a canonical hard benchmark, this ability to generalize across instances highlights the potential of learning proposals that move beyond single problems to entire families of instances. The IsingFormer demonstrates that Monte Carlo methods can be systematically accelerated by neural proposals that capture global structure, yielding faster sampling and stronger performance in combinatorial optimization.",

These vulnerabilities undermine the safety, reliability, and trustworthiness of LLM outputs, posing critical risks in domains such as healthcare, finance, and legal compliance. In this paper, we propose GuardNet, a hierarchical filtering framework that detects and filters jailbreak prompts prior to inference. GuardNet constructs structured graphs that combine sequential links, syntactic dependencies, and attention-derived token relations to capture both linguistic structure and contextual patterns indicative of jailbreak behavior. It then applies graph neural networks at two levels: (i) a prompt-level filter that detects global adversarial prompts, and (ii) a token-level filter that pinpoints fine-grained adversarial spans. Extensive experiments across three datasets and multiple attack settings show that GuardNet substantially outperforms prior defenses. It raises prompt-level F$_1$ scores from 66.4\\% to 99.8\\% on LLM-Fuzzer, and from 67-79\\% to over 94\\% on PLeak datasets.

In this paper, we propose a novel federated learning framework that integrates personalized differential privacy (DP) and adaptive model design. To protect training data, we leverage sample-level representations for knowledge sharing and apply a personalized DP strategy to resist reconstruction attacks.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first personalized DP solution tailored for representation-based FL with theoretical convergence guarantees. Our scheme achieves strong privacy guarantees for training data while significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods in model performance.

Our analysis demonstrates that the forgetting phenomenon can be quantified by the distance between partial-task aware (PTA) and all-task aware (ATA) setups.

For $k=0$ this recovers the graph Laplacian and its well-studied homophily bias. In higher gradings, however, the Hodge Laplacian's bias is more opaque and potentially even degenerate. In this essay, we position sheaf theory as a natural and principled formalism for modifying the Hodge Laplacian's diffusion-mediated interface between local and global descriptors toward more expressive message passing. The sheaf Laplacian's inductive bias correlates dimension-$k$ data features with dimension-$k$ $sheaf$ cohomology, a data-aware generalization of singular cohomology. We will contextualize and novelly extend prior theory on sheaf diffusion in graph learning ($k=0$) in such a light -- and explore how it fails to generalize to $k>0$ -- before developing novel theory and practice for the higher-order setting. Our exposition is accompanied by a self-contained introduction shepherding sheaves from the abstract to the applied.",

        "summary": "Sparse Mixtures of Experts (MoEs) are typically trained to operate at a fixed sparsity level, e.g. $k$ in a top-$k$ gating function. This global sparsity level determines an operating point on the accuracy/latency curve; currently, meeting multiple efficiency targets means training and maintaining multiple models. This practice complicates serving, increases training and maintenance costs, and limits flexibility in meeting diverse latency, efficiency, and energy requirements. We show that pretrained MoEs are more robust to runtime sparsity shifts than commonly assumed, and introduce MoE-PHDS ({\\bf P}ost {\\bf H}oc {\\bf D}eclared {\\bf S}parsity), a lightweight SFT method that turns a single checkpoint into a global sparsity control surface. PHDS mixes training across sparsity levels and anchors with a short curriculum at high sparsity, requiring no architectural changes. The result is predictable accuracy/latency tradeoffs from one model: practitioners can ``dial $k$'' at inference time without swapping checkpoints, changing architecture, or relying on token-level heuristics. Experiments on OLMoE-1B-7B-0125, Qwen1.5-MoE-A2.7B, and proprietary models fit on multiple operating points show that PHDS matches or exceeds well-specified oracle models, improves cross-sparsity agreement by up to 22\\% vs. well-specified oracle models, and enables simplified, flexible runtime MoE deployment by making global sparsity a first-class serving primitive.",

With consideration of this, a number of recent neural network models leverage inductive biases from classical mechanics to encourage model interpretability and ensure forecasted states are physical. However, in general, these models are designed to capture the dynamics of a single system with fixed physical parameters, from state-space measurements of a known configuration space. In this paper we introduce Symplectic Phase Space GAN (SPS-GAN) which can capture the dynamics of multiple systems, and generalize to unseen physical parameters from. Moreover, SPS-GAN does not require prior knowledge of the system configuration space. In fact, SPS-GAN can discover the configuration space structure of the system from arbitrary measurement types (e.g., state-space measurements, video frames). To achieve physically plausible generation, we introduce a novel architecture which embeds a Hamiltonian neural network recurrent module in a conditional GAN backbone. To discover the structure of the configuration space, we optimize the conditional time-series GAN objective with an additional physically motivated term to encourages a sparse representation of the configuration space. We demonstrate the utility of SPS-GAN for trajectory prediction, video generation and symmetry discovery. Our approach captures multiple systems and achieves performance on par with supervised models designed for single systems.",

We investigate whether incorporating variational methods into SAE architectures can improve feature organization and interpretability. We introduce the variational Sparse Autoencoder (vSAE), which replaces deterministic ReLU gating with stochastic sampling from learned Gaussian posteriors and incorporates KL divergence regularization toward a standard normal prior. Our hypothesis is that this probabilistic sampling creates dispersive pressure, causing features to organize more coherently in the latent space while avoiding overlap. We evaluate a Topk vSAE against a standard TopK SAE on Pythia-70M transformer residual steam activations using comprehensive benchmarks including SAE Bench, individual feature interpretability analysis, and global latent space visualization through t-SNE. The vSAE underperforms standard SAE across core evaluation metrics, though excels at feature independence and ablation metrics. The KL divergence term creates excessive regularization pressure that substantially reduces the fraction of living features, leading to observed performance degradation. While vSAE features demonstrate improved robustness, they exhibit many more dead features than baseline. Our findings suggest that naive application of variational methods to SAEs does not improve feature organization or interpretability.",

Multi-model serving further complicates these trade-offs; for example, in cascaded models, each early-exit decision balances latency reduction against potential accuracy loss. Despite the pervasiveness and importance of such trade-offs, current strategies remain largely heuristic and case-specific, limiting both their theoretical guarantees and general applicability. We present a general framework, T-Tamer, which formalizes this setting as a multi-stage decision process, where the objective is to determine both when to exit and which model to consult. Our main result shows that recall (i.e., the ability to revisit earlier models) is both necessary and sufficient for achieving provable performance guarantees. In particular, we prove that strategies without recall cannot obtain any constant-factor approximation to the optimal trade-off, whereas recall-based strategies provably attain the optimal trade-off in polynomial time. We validate our analysis through experiments on synthetic datasets and early-exit workloads for vision and NLP benchmarks. The results show that recall-based strategies consistently yield efficient accuracy-latency trade-offs. We hope this work provides a principled foundation for bridging heuristic practice with theoretical guarantees in the design of early-exit and cascaded models.",

In this work, we systematically integrate optimization expertise to improve formulation accuracy for mixed-integer linear programming, a key family of mathematical programs. Our approach first cleans training data through class-based error analysis to explicitly prevent common mistakes within each optimization class. We then develop multi-turn inference strategies that guide LLMs with class-specific error summaries and solver feedback, enabling iterative refinement.

Within this setting, the actor-critic (AC) framework has achieved strong empirical success. However, both the critic and actor learning is challenging for the off-policy AC methods: first of all, in addition to the classic \"deadly triad\" instability of off-policy evaluation, it also suffers from a \"moving target\" problem, where the policy being evaluated changes continually; secondly, actor learning becomes less efficient due to the difficulty of estimating the exact off-policy policy gradient. The first challenge essentially reduces the problem to repeatedly performing off-policy evaluation for changing policies. For the second challenge, the off-policy policy gradient theorem requires a complex and often impractical algorithm to estimate an additional emphasis critic, which is typically neglected in practice, thereby reducing to the on-policy policy gradient as an approximation. In this work, we introduce a novel concept of functional critic modeling, which leads to a new AC framework that addresses both challenges for actor-critic learning under the deadly triad setting. We provide a theoretical analysis in the linear function setting, establishing the provable convergence of our framework, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first convergent off-policy target-based AC algorithm. From a practical perspective, we further propose a carefully designed neural network architecture for the functional critic modeling and demonstrate its effectiveness through preliminary experiments on widely used RL tasks from the DeepMind Control Benchmark.",

Threats to the external validity of GenAI evaluations arise when the source sample of human raters and system outputs used to obtain a system quality estimate differs from the target distribution at deployment time. In this work, we propose a doubly-robust estimation framework designed to address this evaluation sampling bias. Key to our approach is the use of \"persona\" ratings produced by prompting an LLM evaluator (i.e., an LLM-as-a-judge) to behave as a human rater with specific sociodemographic characteristics. Our doubly-robust framework combines these informative yet imperfect persona ratings with human ratings obtained under evaluation sampling bias to produce statistically valid system quality estimates. In particular, we show that our approach yields valid system quality estimates when either (i) a model trained to predict human ratings using persona ratings and source data observed under sampling bias, or (ii) a reweighting model that corrects for sampling bias is of sufficient quality. We validate our framework theoretically and via a novel Persona Simulation Framework (PSF) designed to systematically manipulate persona quality and the degree of evaluation sampling bias present in source data.

We introduce SINQ to augment existing post-training quantizers with an additional second-axis scale factor and a fast Sinkhorn-Knopp-style algorithm that finds scales to normalize per-row and per-column variances, thereby minimizing a novel per-matrix proxy target for quantization: the matrix imbalance. Our method has no interactions between layers and can be trivially applied to new architectures to quantize any linear layers. We evaluate our method on the Qwen3 model family and DeepSeek-V2.5. SINQ improves WikiText2 and C4 perplexity significantly against uncalibrated uniform quantization baselines and can be further enhanced by combining it with calibration and non-uniform quantization levels.

Previous work has shown that decomposing training into a full-precision (FP) phase followed by a QAT phase yields superior accuracy compared to QAT alone. However, the optimal allocation of compute between the FP and QAT phases remains unclear. We conduct extensive experiments with various compute budgets, QAT bit widths, and model sizes from 86.0M to 2.2B to investigate how different QAT durations impact final performance. We demonstrate that, contrary to previous findings, the loss-optimal ratio of QAT to FP training increases with the total amount of compute. Moreover, the optimal fraction can be accurately predicted for a wide range of model sizes and quantization widths using the tokens-per-parameter-byte statistic. From experimental data, we derive a loss scaling law that predicts both optimal QAT ratios and final model performance across different QAT/FP compute allocation strategies and QAT bit widths. We use the scaling law to make further predictions, which we verify experimentally, including which QAT bit width is optimal under a given memory constraint and how QAT accuracy with different bit widths compares to full-precision model accuracy. Additionally, we propose a novel cooldown and QAT fusion approach that performs learning rate decay jointly with quantization-aware training, eliminating redundant full-precision model updates and achieving significant compute savings. These findings provide practical insights into efficient QAT planning and enable the training of higher-quality quantized models with the same compute budget.",

While recent work has begun exploring the integration of task-specific rewards into distillation processes, existing methods typically rely on ad-hoc reward weighting. We propose a principled optimization framework that maximizes task-specific rewards while constraining the divergence from the teacher model to remain below a specified threshold. Our approach adapts constrained state augmented reinforcement learning to the distillation setting, introducing a modified reward function that maintains theoretical guarantees of constraint satisfaction without requiring state augmentation or teacher model access during deployment and without the computational overhead of the dual Lagrangian methods. Through extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks, we demonstrate that our method achieves better constraint satisfaction rates and better reasoning compared to the soft Lagrangian relaxation baselines while maintaining competitive task performance. Our framework provides a theoretically grounded and practically efficient solution for reward-aware distillation in resource-constrained settings.",

        "summary": "While self-attention is known to learn relations among tokens, we lack a formal understanding of its capacity: how many distinct relations can a single layer reliably recover for a given budget? To formalize this, we introduce Relational Graph Recognition (RGR), where the key-query channel represents a graph on $m$ items with $m'$ directed edges, and, given a context of items, must recover the neighbors of each item. We measure resources by the total key dimension $D_K = h\\,d_k$. Within this framework, we analytically derive a capacity scaling law and validate it empirically. We show that $D_K = \\Theta(m' \\log m' / d_{\\text{model}})$ is both necessary (information-theoretic lower bound) and sufficient (explicit construction) in a broad class of graphs to recover $m'$ relations. This scaling law directly leads to a new, capacity-based rationale for multi-head attention that applies even when each item only attends to a single target. When embeddings are uncompressed ($m = d_{\\text{model}}$) and the graph is a permutation, a single head suffices. However, compression ($m > d_{\\text{model}}$) forces relations into overlapping subspaces, creating interference that a single large head cannot disentangle. Our analysis shows that allocating a fixed $D_K$ across many small heads mitigates this interference, increasing the number of recoverable relations. Controlled single-layer experiments mirror the theory, revealing a sharp performance threshold that matches the predicted capacity scaling and confirms the benefit of distributing $D_K$ across multiple heads. Altogether, these results provide a concrete scaling law for self-attention capacity and a principled design rule for allocating key-query budget across heads.",

Motivated by human memory studies, we investigate the retention characteristics of ICL in multitask settings and extend it to in-context continual learning (ICCL), where continual learning ability emerges through task scheduling and prompt rearrangement. Experiments on Markov-Chain benchmarks demonstrate that, for specific large-language models, ICCL benefits from distributed practice (DP) in a manner analogous to humans, consistently revealing a spacing \"sweet spot\" for retention. Beyond retention performance, we propose a human-retention similarity metric to quantify how closely a continual-learning (CL) method aligns with human retention dynamics. Using this metric, we show that linear-attention models such as MAMBA and RWKV exhibit particularly human-like retention patterns, despite their retention performance lagging behind that of Transformer-based LLMs. Overall, our results establish ICCL as both cognitively plausible and practically effective, providing an inference-only CL paradigm that mitigates catastrophic forgetting and addresses the stability-plasticity dilemma in conventional CL methods.",

This paper presents a comprehensive performance analysis of various causal inference operators on a modern NPU. We benchmark standard quadratic attention against several sub-quadratic alternatives, including structured state-space and linear attention models. Our analysis reveals that while sub-quadratic methods offer superior scalability, they introduce distinct computational bottlenecks on the NPU's specialized execution units. We identify that quadratic attention becomes severely memory-bound, suffering from cache inefficiency and pipeline stalls exceeding 95% at long contexts. In contrast, sub-quadratic models can become compute-bound on programmable vector cores.

We propose a different paradigm, one in which an agent learns to play by reasoning and planning. We introduce Cogito, ergo ludo (CEL), a novel agent architecture that leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to build an explicit, language-based understanding of its environment's mechanics and its own strategy. Starting from a tabula rasa state with no prior knowledge (except action set), CEL operates on a cycle of interaction and reflection. After each episode, the agent analyzes its complete trajectory to perform two concurrent learning processes: Rule Induction, where it refines its explicit model of the environment's dynamics, and Strategy and Playbook Summarization, where it distills experiences into an actionable strategic playbook. We evaluate CEL on diverse grid-world tasks (i.e., Minesweeper, Frozen Lake, and Sokoban), and show that the CEL agent successfully learns to master these games by autonomously discovering their rules and developing effective policies from sparse rewards. Ablation studies confirm that the iterative process is critical for sustained learning. Our work demonstrates a path toward more general and interpretable agents that not only act effectively but also build a transparent and improving model of their world through explicit reasoning on raw experience.",

        "summary": "Generative robot policies such as Flow Matching offer flexible, multi-modal policy learning but are sample-inefficient. Although object-centric policies improve sample efficiency, it does not resolve this limitation. In this work, we propose Multi-Stream Generative Policy (MSG), an inference-time composition framework that trains multiple object-centric policies and combines them at inference to improve generalization and sample efficiency. MSG is model-agnostic and inference-only, hence widely applicable to various generative policies and training paradigms. We perform extensive experiments both in simulation and on a real robot, demonstrating that our approach learns high-quality generative policies from as few as five demonstrations, resulting in a 95% reduction in demonstrations, and improves policy performance by 89 percent compared to single-stream approaches. Furthermore, we present comprehensive ablation studies on various composition strategies and provide practical recommendations for deployment. Finally, MSG enables zero-shot object instance transfer. We make our code publicly available at https://msg.cs.uni-freiburg.de.",

        "summary": "We introduce Fed-Span, a novel federated/distributed learning framework designed for low Earth orbit satellite constellations. By leveraging graph-theoretic principles, Fed-Span addresses critical challenges inherent to distributed learning in dynamic satellite networks, including intermittent satellite connectivity, heterogeneous computational capabilities of satellites, and time-varying satellites' datasets. At its core, Fed-Span builds upon minimum spanning tree (MST) and minimum spanning forest (MSF) topologies, enabling spanning model aggregation and dispatching processes for distributed learning. To formalize Fed-Span, we offer a fresh perspective on MST/MSF topologies by formulating them through a set of continuous constraint representations (CCRs), thereby devising graph-theoretical abstractions into an optimizable framework for satellite networks. Using these CCRs, we obtain the energy consumption and latency of operations in Fed-Span. Moreover, we derive novel convergence bounds for non-convex machine learning loss functions, accommodating the key system characteristics and degrees of freedom of Fed-Span. Finally, we propose a comprehensive optimization problem that jointly minimizes model prediction loss, energy consumption, and latency of Fed-Span. We unveil that this problem is NP-hard and develop a systematic approach to transform it into a geometric programming formulation, solved via successive convex optimization with performance guarantees. Through evaluations on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that Fed-Span outperforms existing methods, with faster model convergence, greater energy efficiency, and reduced latency. These results highlight Fed-Span as a novel solution for efficient distributed learning in satellite networks.",

In this work, we introduce a hierarchical framework that leverages code-generating vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with low-level diffusion policies to effectively imitate and generalize robotic behavior. Our key insight is to treat open-source robotic APIs not only as execution interfaces but also as sources of structured supervision: the associated subtask functions - when exposed - can serve as modular, semantically meaningful labels. We train a VLM to decompose task descriptions into executable subroutines, which are then grounded through a diffusion policy trained to imitate the corresponding robot behavior. To handle the non-Markovian nature of both code execution and certain real-world tasks, such as object swapping, our architecture incorporates a memory mechanism that maintains subtask context across time. We find that this design enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization when compared to flat policies and enables separate evaluation of high-level planning and low-level control.",

Weight decay induces an implicit nuclear-norm regularization, favoring low-rank query and key matrices. Leveraging this, we compare the standard factorized training of query and key matrices with a direct parameterization in which their product is trained element-wise, revealing the inductive bias introduced by the factorized form.

        "summary": "Score-based methods, such as diffusion models and Bayesian inverse problems, are often interpreted as learning the data distribution in the low-noise limit ($\\sigma \\to 0$). In this work, we propose an alternative perspective: their success arises from implicitly learning the data manifold rather than the full distribution. Our claim is based on a novel analysis of scores in the small-$\\sigma$ regime that reveals a sharp separation of scales: information about the data manifold is $\\Theta(\\sigma^{-2})$ stronger than information about the distribution. We argue that this insight suggests a paradigm shift from the less practical goal of distributional learning to the more attainable task of geometric learning, which provably tolerates $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ larger errors in score approximation. We illustrate this perspective through three consequences: i) in diffusion models, concentration on data support can be achieved with a score error of $o(\\sigma^{-2})$, whereas recovering the specific data distribution requires a much stricter $o(1)$ error; ii) more surprisingly, learning the uniform distribution on the manifold-an especially structured and useful object-is also $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ easier; and iii) in Bayesian inverse problems, the maximum entropy prior is $O(\\sigma^{-2})$ more robust to score errors than generic priors. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with preliminary experiments on large-scale models, including Stable Diffusion.",

A key reason is that global pooling creates an information bottleneck causing linear probes to misrepresent the embedding quality: The $\\texttt{cls}$-token discards crucial token information about dispersed, localized events in multi-label audio. This weakness is rooted in the mismatch between the pretraining objective (operating globally) and the downstream task (localized events). Across a comprehensive benchmark of 13 datasets and 6 spectrogram-based encoders, we first investigate the global pooling bottleneck. We then introduce binarized prototypical probes: a lightweight and simple pooling method that learns prototypes to perform class-wise information aggregation. Despite its simplicity, our method notably outperforms linear and attentive probing. Our work establishes probing as a competitive and efficient paradigm for evaluating audio SSL models, challenging the reliance on costly fine-tuning.",

        "summary": "The LogSumExp function, also known as the free energy, plays a central role in many important optimization problems, including entropy-regularized optimal transport and distributionally robust optimization (DRO). It is also the dual to the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is widely used in machine learning. In practice, when the number of exponential terms inside the logarithm is large or infinite, optimization becomes challenging since computing the gradient requires differentiating every term. Previous approaches that replace the full sum with a small batch introduce significant bias. We propose a novel approximation to LogSumExp that can be efficiently optimized using stochastic gradient methods. This approximation is rooted in a sound modification of the KL divergence in the dual, resulting in a new $f$-divergence called the safe KL divergence. The accuracy of the approximation is controlled by a tunable parameter and can be made arbitrarily small. Like the LogSumExp, our approximation preserves convexity. Moreover, when applied to an $L$-smooth function bounded from below, the smoothness constant of the resulting objective scales linearly with $L$. Experiments in DRO and continuous optimal transport demonstrate the advantages of our approach over state-of-the-art baselines and the effective treatment of numerical issues associated with the standard LogSumExp and KL.",

In this work, we introduce a set of novel data structures and algorithmic methods, a combination of which leads to an elegant, effective, and highly efficient solution to sparse ANNS. Our contributions range from a theoretically-grounded sketching algorithm for sparse vectors to reduce their effective dimensionality while preserving inner product-induced ranks; a geometric organization of the inverted index; and the blending of local and global information to improve the efficiency and efficacy of ANNS.

While the greedy selection strategy is desirable for its constant-factor approximation guarantee to the optimal solution, it requires knowledge of the true error at each step, which is generally unavailable in practice. We address this by proposing an approximate greedy router that efficiently mimics a greedy approach to solver selection.

While generative data augmentation is a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine, Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled data spectrum for this tuning process. Applying CIFT to policy architectures such as $\\pi_0$ and Diffusion Policy improves OOD success rates by over 54\\%. These results indicate that fidelity-aware composition, beyond data synthesis alone, is an important component for developing robust, general-purpose robots.",

The central idea is that noise manifests as low magnitude variation in off-manifold directions in contrast to the relevant variation of the desired distribution which is mostly confined to on-manifold directions. We introduce the notion of an extended score and show that, in a simplified setting, it can be used to reduce small variations to zero, while leaving large variations mostly unchanged.

While these approaches make more realistic motions possible, they are limited by the amount of available motion data, and do not incorporate prior knowledge about the physical laws governing the system and its interactions with the environment. Thus they may violate such laws, leading to divergent trajectories and sliding contacts which limit real-world stability. We address such limitations via a two-pronged learning strategy which leverages the known physics of the system and fundamental control principles. First, we encode physics priors during supervised imitation learning to promote trajectory feasibility. Second, we minimize drift at inference time by applying a proportional-integral controller directly to the generated output state. We validate our method on various locomotion behaviors for the ergoCub humanoid robot, where a physics-informed loss encourages zero contact foot velocity.

We derive information-theoretic lower bounds and optimal strategies with matching upper bounds, showing regret typically scales as the square root of rounds. As an application, we reframe quantum state tomography to both learn the state efficiently and minimize measurement disturbance. For pure states and continuous actions, we achieve polylogarithmic regret using a sample-optimal algorithm based on a weighted online least squares estimator. The algorithm relies on the optimistic principle and controls the eigenvalues of the design matrix. We also apply our framework to quantum recommender systems and thermodynamic work extraction from unknown states. In this last setting, our results demonstrate an exponential advantage in work dissipation over tomography-based protocols.",

In the complex video game Minecraft, the world model accurately predicts object interactions and game mechanics, outperforming previous world models by a large margin. The world model achieves real-time interactive inference on a single GPU through a shortcut forcing objective and an efficient transformer architecture. Moreover, the world model learns general action conditioning from only a small amount of data, allowing it to extract the majority of its knowledge from diverse unlabeled videos. We propose the challenge of obtaining diamonds in Minecraft from only offline data, aligning with practical applications such as robotics where learning from environment interaction can be unsafe and slow. This task requires choosing sequences of over 20,000 mouse and keyboard actions from raw pixels.

A final active learning phase ensures model completeness. Extensive experiments on diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our interactive refinement phase is crucial for achieving high target model coverage and overall model accuracy from limited examples, doing so with manageable query complexity.

A key component of these systems is the shared function library, a collection of software tools that agents use to process sensor data and navigate complex driving environments. Despite its critical role in agent decision-making, the function library remains an under-explored vulnerability. In this paper, we introduce FuncPoison, a novel poisoning-based attack targeting the function library to manipulate the behavior of LLM-driven multi-agent autonomous systems. FuncPoison exploits two key weaknesses in how agents access the function library: (1) agents rely on text-based instructions to select tools; and (2) these tools are activated using standardized command formats that attackers can replicate. By injecting malicious tools with deceptive instructions, FuncPoison manipulates one agent s decisions--such as misinterpreting road conditions--triggering cascading errors that mislead other agents in the system. We experimentally evaluate FuncPoison on two representative multi-agent autonomous driving systems, demonstrating its ability to significantly degrade trajectory accuracy, flexibly target specific agents to induce coordinated misbehavior, and evade diverse defense mechanisms. Our results reveal that the function library, often considered a simple toolset, can serve as a critical attack surface in LLM-based autonomous driving systems, raising elevated concerns on their reliability.",

Two classes of distortion measures are considered: (i) outage-based metrics, suitable for tasks tolerating occasional packet losses, such as real-time control or monitoring; and (ii) bounded distortion metrics, relevant to semantic-rich tasks like text or video transmission. We propose two zero-delay compression algorithms leveraging online conformal prediction to provide per-sequence guarantees on the distortion of reconstructed sequences over error-free and packet-erasure channels with feedback. For erasure channels, we introduce a doubly-adaptive conformal update to compensate for channel-induced errors and derive sufficient conditions on erasure statistics to ensure distortion constraints. Experiments on semantic text compression validate the approach, showing significant bit rate reductions while strictly meeting distortion guarantees compared to state-of-the-art prediction-powered compression methods.",

Built upon the insight that many CQs are integrals of regression functions, our framework models the regression function with a Gaussian Process. For the distribution component, we explore both a baseline using explicit density estimators and a more integrated method using conditional mean embeddings in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. This latter approach offers key advantages: it bypasses explicit density estimation, operates within the same function space as the GP, and adaptively refines the distributional model after each update. Our framework enables the principled derivation of acquisition strategies from the CQ's posterior uncertainty; we instantiate this principle with two utility functions based on information gain and total variance reduction.

The numerical analysis of non-Newtonian fluids presents significant challenges, as traditional algorithms designed for Newtonian fluids with constant viscosity often struggle to converge when applied to non-Newtonian cases, where rheological properties vary dynamically with flow conditions. Among these, power-law fluids exhibit viscosity that decreases exponentially as the shear rate increases, making numerical simulations particularly difficult. The complexity further escalates in free surface flow scenarios, where computational challenges intensify. In such cases, particle-based methods like smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) provide advantages over traditional grid-based techniques, such as the finite element method (FEM). Building on this approach, we introduce a novel GNN-based numerical model to enhance the computational efficiency of non-Newtonian power-law fluid flow simulations. Our model is trained on SPH simulation data, learning the effects of particle accelerations in the presence of SPH interactions based on the fluid's power-law parameters. The GNN significantly accelerates computations while maintaining reliable accuracy in benchmark tests, including dam-break and droplet impact simulations.

Owing to their high similarity, most of the existing approaches face challenges in differentiating between DBPs and RBPs leading to high cross-prediction errors. Moreover, identifying proteins which bind to both DNA and RNA (DRBPs) is also quite a challenging task. In this regard, we propose a novel framework viz. LAMP-PRo which is based on pre-trained protein language model (PLM), attention mechanisms and multi-label learning to mitigate these issues. First, pre-trained PLM such ESM-2 is used for embedding the protein sequences followed by convolutional neural network (CNN). Subsequently multi-head self-attention mechanism is applied for the contextual information while label-aware attention is used to compute class-specific representations by attending to the sequence in a way that is tailored to each label (DBP, RBP and non-NABP) in a multi-label setup. We have also included a novel cross-label attention mechanism to explicitly capture dependencies between DNA- and RNA-binding proteins, enabling more accurate prediction of DRBP. Finally, a linear layer followed by a sigmoid function are used for the final prediction. Extensive experiments are carried out to compare LAMP-PRo with the existing methods wherein the proposed model shows consistent competent performance. Furthermore, we also provide visualization to showcase model interpretability, highlighting which parts of the sequence are most relevant for a predicted label.

As a result, RLVR often distills existing capabilities rather than discovering new reasoning strategies. To overcome this, we introduce a Risk-Sensitive Reinforcement Learning framework. Our approach employs a risk-seeking objective that interpolates between mean and maximum rewards, leading to a novel algorithm, Risk-Sensitive GRPO (RS-GRPO), which drives deeper exploration by amplifying learning from challenging prompts. Remarkably, RS-GRPO is simple to implement, requiring only minor code modifications.

We present VeriLLM, a publicly verifiable protocol for decentralized LLM inference that (i) achieves security under a one-honest-verifier assumption, (ii) attains near-negligible verification cost (about 1% of the underlying inference) via a lightweight verification algorithm designed explicitly for LLMs, and (iii) enforces honest checking through a peer-prediction mechanism that mitigates lazy verification in naive voting. We further introduce an isomorphic inference-verification network that multiplexes both roles on the same set of GPU workers. This architecture (i) increases GPU utilization and thereby improves end-to-end throughput for both inference and verification, (ii) expands the effective pool of available validators, strengthening robustness and security, and (iii) enforces task indistinguishability at the worker boundary to prevent job-type-conditioned behavior. Finally, we provide a formal game-theoretic analysis and prove that, under our incentives, honest inference and verification constitute a Nash equilibrium, ensuring incentive compatibility against rational adversaries. To our knowledge, this is the first decentralized inference verification protocol with an end-to-end game-theoretic security proof.",

Prior work shows that such telemetry can be highly identifying and reflect broad user traits, often aligning with intuitive \"folk theories\" of body language. However, it remains unclear to what extent motion kinematics encode more nuanced cognitive states, such as confusion, hesitation, and readiness, which lack clear correlates with motion. To investigate this, we introduce a novel dataset of head and hand motion with frame-level annotations of these states collected during structured decision-making tasks. Our findings suggest that deep temporal models can infer subtle cognitive states from motion alone, achieving comparable performance with human observers. This work demonstrates that standard VR telemetry contains strong patterns related to users' internal cognitive processes, which opens the door for a new generation of adaptive virtual environments. To enhance reproducibility and support future work, we will make our dataset and modeling framework publicly available.",

Collaborative tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90 percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline mitigation strategies.",

        "summary": "Foundation models pretrained on various and unlabeled data have demonstrated significant success in natural language and vision, but their application to electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenged due to the signal's unique properties. Existing brain foundation models that inherit architectures designed for text or images lead to three limitations in pre-training: 1) conflating time-domain waveform patterns with frequency-domain rhythmic features in a single processing stream, 2) ignoring the critical spatial topology of electrodes with different standards, and 3) reliance on the inflexible, dense network to process functionally distinct EEG patterns. To address these challenges, we introduce the Unified Neural Topological Foundation Model (Uni-NTFM), which is designed based on neuroscience principles to produce universal and interpretable representations. Uni-NTFM integrates three core innovations: 1) a decoupled architecture parallelly encodes time, frequency, and raw signal representations before performing cross-domain feature integration; 2) a topological embedding mechanism to unify electrodes from different international standards and generate structured input sequences for brain regions; and 3) a Mixture-of-Experts neural Transformer that efficiently scales model capacity by routing signal patterns to specialized subnetworks. The largest model, Uni-NTFM$_{large}$, has a record-breaking 1.9B parameters and was pretrained on over 28,000 hours of diverse EEG data via a dual-domain masked reconstruction objective. Uni-NTFM significantly outperforms existing task-specific methods and foundation models across nine distinct downstream tasks under both linear probing and fine-tuning settings, demonstrating a superior ability to learn universal representations of brain activity.",

Deploying LLMs/VLMs for motion planning, however, faces two key obstacles: (i) symbolic plans are rarely grounded in scene geometry and object physics, and (ii) model outputs can vary for identical prompts, undermining execution reliability. We propose ViReSkill, a framework that pairs vision-grounded replanning with a skill memory for accumulation and reuse. When a failure occurs, the replanner generates a new action sequence conditioned on the current scene, tailored to the observed state. On success, the executed plan is stored as a reusable skill and replayed in future encounters without additional calls to LLMs/VLMs. This feedback loop enables autonomous continual learning: each attempt immediately expands the skill set and stabilizes subsequent executions. We evaluate ViReSkill on simulators such as LIBERO and RLBench as well as on a physical robot. Across all settings, it consistently outperforms conventional baselines in task success rate, demonstrating robust sim-to-real generalization.",

Many systems require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs, (ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii) contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning. Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.",

Empirical results show that our method consistently outperforms baselines in predictive accuracy and ranking alignment, achieving the highest Spearman correlation with return-based similarity.

This approach, when combined with intra-cluster fitness sharing and the protection of particles not included in a cluster, effectively prevents premature convergence in multimodal environments while maintaining estimate compactness. We validate our approach in a multimodal robotics simulation and a real-world multimodal indoor environment. We compare the performance to several diversity maintenance algorithms from the literature, including Deterministic Resampling and Particle Gaussian Mixtures.

Its training combines three advances: (i) DUETQA, a 5K-sample dataset generated via multi-agent self-play that enforces strict web-search dependence and heterogeneous source grounding; (ii) RAPO, a zero-overhead extension of GRPO that stabilizes multi-turn Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards through curriculum pruning, reward-aware advantage scaling, and per-prompt replay buffers; and (iii) a steerable step-level reward that classifies each tool call by cognitive behavior and marginal utility, enabling explicit control over search trajectory breadth, depth, and horizon. These improvements enable reliable extension of tool-calling beyond 20 calls when warranted. The second is Fathom-Synthesizer-4B, trained from Qwen3-4B, which converts multi-turn DeepSearch traces into structured, citation-dense DeepResearch Reports for comprehensive synthesis.

To bridge this gap, we develop a stable and efficient algorithm that computes the full solution path of the regularized RKHS conformal optimization problem, at essentially the same cost as a single kernel quantile fit. Our path-tracing framework simultaneously tunes hyperparameters, providing smoothness control and data-adaptive calibration.

Starting from a non-convex constrained optimization problem as a motivation, we provide a geometric reformulation and associated algorithm for computing the nonconformity score and associated split conformal prediction sets in O(K) time for K-class problems. Using this score in split conformal prediction leads to our proposed Singleton-Optimized Conformal Prediction (SOCOP) method. We evaluate our method in experiments on image classification and LLM multiple-choice question-answering, comparing with standard nonconformity scores such as the (negative) label probability estimates and their cumulative distribution function; both of which are motivated by optimizing length. The results show that SOCOP increases singleton frequency (sometimes by over 20%) compared to the above scores, with minimal impact on average set size.",

These surrogates are employed within Krylov subspace methods to compute coarse steady and unsteady-states, while also providing Jacobian information in a matrix-free manner. Krylov-Arnoldi iterations then approximate the dominant eigenspectrum, yielding reduced models that capture the open-loop slow dynamics without explicit Jacobian assembly.

Methods: Our method selects a subset of adversarial inputs with a high likelihood of exposing model faults, without relying on architecture-specific characteristics or formal verification, making it adaptable across diverse DNNs. Results: Our results demonstrate that the proposed LBT method consistently surpasses baseline approaches in prioritizing fault-revealing inputs and accelerating fault detection. By efficiently organizing test permutations, it uncovers all potential faults significantly faster across various datasets, model architectures, and adversarial attack techniques. Conclusion: Beyond improving fault detection, our method preserves input diversity and provides effective guidance for model retraining, further enhancing robustness.

In a white-box study on compact Transformers under small $L_0$ budgets, influence guidance finds label-flip inputs more efficiently than a FIFO baseline and maintains steady progress on deeper networks. Aggregating successful attack instances with a SHAP-based critical decision path analysis reveals recurring, compact decision logic shared across attacks.

We address this by introducing surrogate latent spaces: non-parametric, low-dimensional Euclidean embeddings that can be extracted from any generative model without additional training. The axes in the Euclidean space can be defined via examples, providing a simple and interpretable approach to define custom latent spaces that both express intended features and are convenient to use in downstream tasks. The representation is Euclidean and has controllable dimensionality, permitting direct application of standard optimisation algorithms to traverse the outputs of generative models.

One example is playing technique on the violin, which affords its distinct palette of timbres for maximal emotional impact. Here, we propose \\textbf{VioPTT} (Violin Playing Technique-aware Transcription), a lightweight, end-to-end model that directly transcribes violin playing technique in addition to pitch onset and offset. Furthermore, we release \\textbf{MOSA-VPT}, a novel, high-quality synthetic violin playing technique dataset to circumvent the need for manually labeled annotations. Leveraging this dataset, our model demonstrated strong generalization to real-world note-level violin technique recordings in addition to achieving state-of-the-art transcription performance. To our knowledge, VioPTT is the first to jointly combine violin transcription and playing technique prediction within a unified framework.",

        "summary": "Training large language models with Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) exhibits a set of distinctive and puzzling behaviors that remain poorly understood, including a two-stage learning curve, V-shaped response-length trajectories, and a pronounced vulnerability to catastrophic forgetting. In this work, we propose that these seemingly disparate phenomena can be explained using a single unifying theory: the model's reasoning process maps to the self-organization of a semantic complex network whose topology remains persistently sparse, with the average degree pinned close to two. This topology imposes a fundamental mechanism for forgetting and learning: it first drives the system into a maximally frustrated state where ``skill islands'' form, slow-learning happens, and forgetting is induced; then it enters a sharp growth phase where the new skills are ``bolted on'', driven by phase-transition-like learning at the web's frontier. Equipped with the theory, we propose \\textit{Annealed-RLVR}, a principled algorithm that introduces an SFT-based ``heating'' step at the point of maximal frustration to resolve the competitive bottleneck and enhance the reasoning capability of the model. Experiments on a 1.5B-parameter model demonstrate that the approach outperforms standard RLVR on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks. By recasting RLVR from black-box optimization into a predictable process of structural self-organization, our work provides a new physical intuition for engineering the emergent reasoning capabilities of future AI systems.",

        "summary": "Non-ideal communication links, especially delays, critically affect fast networked controls in power systems, such as the wide-area damping control (WADC). Traditionally, a delay estimation and compensation approach is adopted to address this cyber-physical coupling, but it demands very high accuracy for the fast WADC and cannot handle other cyber concerns like link failures or {cyber perturbations}. Hence, we propose a new risk-constrained framework that can target the communication delays, yet amenable to general uncertainty under the cyber-physical couplings. Our WADC model includes the synchronous generators (SGs), and also voltage source converters (VSCs) for additional damping capabilities. To mitigate uncertainty, a mean-variance risk constraint is introduced to the classical optimal control cost of the linear quadratic regulator (LQR). Unlike estimating delays, our approach can effectively mitigate large communication delays by improving the worst-case performance. A reinforcement learning (RL)-based algorithm, namely, stochastic gradient-descent with max-oracle (SGDmax), is developed to solve the risk-constrained problem. We further show its guaranteed convergence to stationarity at a high probability, even using the simple zero-order policy gradient (ZOPG). Numerical tests on the IEEE 68-bus system not only verify SGDmax's convergence and VSCs' damping capabilities, but also demonstrate that our approach outperforms conventional delay compensator-based methods under estimation error. While focusing on performance improvement under large delays, our proposed risk-constrained design can effectively mitigate the worst-case oscillations, making it equally effective for addressing other communication issues and cyber perturbations.",

These networks typically consist of multiple serially connected layers between input and output layers--a configuration we term spatially series AONNs, with deep neural networks (DNNs) being the most prominent examples. However, such series architectures suffer from progressive signal degradation during information propagation and critically require additional nonlinearity designs to model complex relationships effectively. Here we propose a spatially parallel architecture for all-optical neural networks (SP-AONNs). Unlike series architecture that sequentially processes information through consecutively connected optical layers, SP-AONNs divide the input signal into identical copies fed simultaneously into separate optical layers. Through coherent interference between these parallel linear sub-networks, SP-AONNs inherently enable nonlinear computation without relying on active nonlinear components or iterative updates. We implemented a modular 4F optical system for SP-AONNs and evaluated its performance across multiple image classification benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that increasing the number of parallel sub-networks consistently enhances accuracy, improves noise robustness, and expands model expressivity. Our findings highlight spatial parallelism as a practical and scalable strategy for advancing the capabilities of optical neural computing.",

While leveraging all cliques in a network to handle higher-order interactions is intuitive, it often leads to computational inefficiencies due to overlapping information between higher-order and lower-order cliques. To address this issue, we propose an augmented maximal clique strategy. Although using only maximal cliques can reduce unnecessary overlap and provide a concise representation of the network, certain nodes may still appear in multiple maximal cliques, resulting in imbalanced training data. Therefore, our augmented maximal clique approach selectively includes some non-maximal cliques to mitigate the overrepresentation of specific nodes and promote more balanced learning across the network. Comparative analyses on synthetic networks and real-world citation datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms approaches based on pairwise interactions, all cliques, or only maximal cliques. Finally, by integrating this strategy into GNN-based semi-supervised learning, we establish a link between maximal clique-based methods and GNNs, showing that incorporating higher-order structures improves predictive accuracy. As a result, the augmented maximal clique strategy offers a computationally efficient and effective solution for higher-order network learning.",

Classical units, including Hodgkin-Huxley, Izhikevich, and the Random Neural Network, map poorly to these needs. We introduce Network-Optimised Spiking (NOS), a compact two-variable unit whose state encodes normalised queue occupancy and a recovery resource. The model uses a saturating nonlinearity to enforce finite buffers, a service-rate leak, and graph-local inputs with delays and optional per link gates. It supports two differentiable reset schemes for training and deployment. We give conditions for equilibrium existence and uniqueness, local stability tests from the Jacobian trace and determinant, and a network threshold that scales with the Perron eigenvalue of the coupling matrix. The analysis yields an operational rule g* ~ k* rho(W) linking damping and offered load, shows how saturation enlarges the stable region, and explains finite-size smoothing of synchrony onsets. Stochastic arrivals follow a Poisson shot-noise model aligned with telemetry smoothing. Against queueing baselines, NOS matches M/M/1 mean by calibration while truncating deep tails under bursty input. In closed loop it gives, low-jitte with short settling. In zero-shot, label-free forecasting NOS is calibrated per node from arrival statistics. Its NOS dynamics yield high AUROC/AUPRC, enabling timely detection of congestion onsets with few false positives. Under a train-calibrated residual protocol across chain, star, and scale-free topologies, NOS improves early-warning F1 and detection latency over MLP, RNN, GRU, and tGNN. We provide guidance for data-driven initialisation, surrogate-gradient training with a homotopy on reset sharpness, and explicit stability checks with topology-aware bounds for resource constrained deployments.",

Excessive trust can lead users to accept AI-generated outputs without question, overlooking critical flaws, while insufficient trust may result in disregarding valuable insights from AI systems, hindering performance. Despite its importance, there is currently no definitive and objective method for measuring trust calibration between humans and AI. Current approaches lack standardization and consistent metrics that can be broadly applied across various contexts, and they don't distinguish between the formation of opinions and subsequent human decisions. In this work, we propose a novel and objective method for dynamic trust calibration, introducing a standardized trust calibration measure and an indicator. By utilizing Contextual Bandits-an adaptive algorithm that incorporates context into decision-making-our indicator dynamically assesses when to trust AI contributions based on learned contextual information. We evaluate this indicator across three diverse datasets, demonstrating that effective trust calibration results in significant improvements in decision-making performance, as evidenced by 10 to 38% increase in reward metrics. These findings not only enhance theoretical understanding but also provide practical guidance for developing more trustworthy AI systems supporting decisions in critical domains, for example, disease diagnoses and criminal justice.",

We evaluate our approach on simulated manipulation tasks in {RLBench}, as well as real-world tasks such as occluded object picking, in-hand spoon reorientation, and puzzle insertion, where it significantly outperforms feature-concatenation baselines on scenarios requiring multimodal reasoning.

We address this issue by introducing Flow Matching Corrected Posterior Estimation (FMCPE), a framework that leverages the flow matching paradigm to refine simulation-trained posterior estimators using a small set of real calibration samples. Our approach proceeds in two stages: first, a posterior approximator is trained on abundant simulated data; second, flow matching transports its predictions toward the true posterior supported by real observations, without requiring explicit knowledge of the misspecification. This design enables FMCPE to combine the scalability of SBI with robustness to distributional shift. Across synthetic benchmarks and real-world datasets, we show that our proposal consistently mitigates the effects of misspecification, delivering improved inference accuracy and uncertainty calibration compared to standard SBI baselines, while remaining computationally efficient.",

It extends the classical Google PageRank model to a tensor-based formulation, leading to a nonlinear system that captures multi-way dependencies between states. Newton-based methods can achieve local quadratic convergence for this problem, but they require solving a large linear system at each iteration, which becomes too costly for large-scale applications.

We introduce CrediBench: a large-scale data processing pipeline for constructing temporal web graphs that jointly model textual content and hyperlink structure for misinformation detection. Unlike prior work, our approach captures the dynamic evolution of general misinformation domains, including changes in both content and inter-site references over time. Our processed one-month snapshot extracted from the Common Crawl archive in December 2024 contains 45 million nodes and 1 billion edges, representing the largest web graph dataset made publicly available for misinformation research to date. From our experiments on this graph snapshot, we demonstrate the strength of both structural and webpage content signals for learning credibility scores, which measure source reliability.

To address this issue, we investigate the Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) paradigm and its impact to transitive relation learning. We theoretically analyze the MTP paradigm using a Transformer architecture composed of a shared output head and a transfer layer. Our analysis reveals that the transfer layer gradually learns the multi-step adjacency information, which in turn enables the backbone model to capture unobserved transitive reachability relations beyond those directly present in the training data, albeit with some inevitable noise in adjacency estimation. Building on this foundation, we propose two strategies to enhance the transfer layer and overall learning quality: Next-Token Injection (NTI) and a Transformer-based transfer layer. Our experiments on both synthetic graphs and the Blocksworld planning benchmark validate our theoretical findings and demonstrate that the improvements significantly enhance the model's path-planning capability. These findings deepen our understanding of how Transformers with MTP learn in complex planning tasks, and provide practical strategies to overcome the transitivity bottleneck, paving the way toward structurally aware and general-purpose planning models.",

This paper introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that integrates artificial intelligence (AI) optimization with legacy device coexistence. We first develop a dynamic backoff selection mechanism that adapts to real-time channel conditions through access deferral events while maintaining full compatibility with conventional CSMA/CA operations. Second, we introduce a fairness quantification metric aligned with enhanced distributed channel access (EDCA) principles to ensure equitable medium access opportunities. Finally, we propose a centralized training decentralized execution (CTDE) architecture incorporating neighborhood activity patterns as observational inputs, optimized via constrained multi-agent proximal policy optimization (MAPPO) to jointly minimize collisions and guarantee fairness. Experimental results demonstrate that our solution significantly reduces collision probability compared to conventional BEB while preserving backward compatibility with commercial Wi-Fi devices.

Constructing reliable conditional distributions from limited data is notoriously difficult, motivating a series of optimal-transport-based proposals that address this uncertainty in a distributionally robust manner. Yet these approaches remain fragmented, each constrained by its own limitations: some rely on point estimates or restrictive structural assumptions, others apply only to narrow classes of risk measures, and their structural connections are unclear. We introduce a universal framework for distributionally robust conditional risk minimization, built on a novel union-ball formulation in optimal transport. This framework offers three key advantages: interpretability, by subsuming existing methods as special cases and revealing their deep structural links; tractability, by yielding convex reformulations for virtually all major risk functionals studied in the literature; and scalability, by supporting cutting-plane algorithms for large-scale conditional risk problems. Applications to portfolio optimization with rank-dependent expected utility highlight the practical effectiveness of the framework, with conditional models converging to optimal solutions where unconditional ones clearly do not.",

With these enhancements, we surprisingly find that increasing the dropout rate and the number of trees grown in parallel at each iteration substantially enhances signal recovery and overall performance. Our resulting algorithms enjoy similar CLTs, which we use to construct built-in confidence intervals, prediction intervals, and rigorous hypothesis tests for assessing variable importance. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our algorithms perform well, interpolate between regularized boosting and random forests, and confirm the validity of their built-in statistical inference procedures.",

        "summary": "In WSN/IoT, node localization is essential to long-running applications for accurate environment monitoring and event detection, often covering a large area in the field. Due to the lower time resolution of typical WSN/IoT platforms (e.g., 1 microsecond on ESP32 platforms) and the jitters in timestamping, packet-level localization techniques cannot provide meter-level resolution. For high-precision localization as well as world-wide interoperability via 2.4-GHz ISM band, a new variant of LoRa, called LoRa 2.4 GHz, was proposed by semtech, which provides a radio frequency (RF) time of flight (ToF) ranging method for meter-level localization. However, the existing datasets reported in the literature are limited in their coverages and do not take into account varying environmental factors such as temperature and humidity. To address these issues, LoRa 2.4 GHz RF ToF ranging data was collected on a sports field at the XJTLU south campus, where three LoRa nodes logged samples of ranging with a LoRa base station, together with temperature and humidity, at reference points arranged as a 3x3 grid covering 400 square meter over three weeks and uploaded all measurement records to the base station equipped with an ESP32-based transceiver for machine and user communications. The results of a preliminary investigation based on a simple deep neural network (DNN) model demonstrate that the environmental factors, including the temperature and humidity, significantly affect the accuracy of ranging, which calls for advanced methods of compensating for the effects of environmental factors on LoRa RF ToF ranging outdoors.",

To address these issues, we propose a novel indoor localization and navigation framework integrating Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting, LiDAR-based simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) navigation based on an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m. In contrast, the mean 2D errors of Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting reach up to 1.3404 m in areas with severe signal interference, and those of LiDAR/IMU localization are between 0.6233 m and 2.8803 m due to cumulative drift.",

To address these challenges, we propose FedBit, a hardware/software co-designed framework optimized for the Brakerski-Fan-Vercauteren (BFV) scheme.

To address this challenge, we propose the Sparse Deep Additive Model with Interactions (SDAMI), a framework that combines sparsity driven feature selection with deep subnetworks for flexible function approximation. Unlike conventional deep learning models, which often function as black boxes, SDAMI explicitly disentangles main effects and interaction effects to enhance interpretability. At the same time, its deep additive structure achieves higher predictive accuracy than classical additive models. Central to SDAMI is the concept of an Effect Footprint, which assumes that higher order interactions project marginally onto main effects. Guided by this principle, SDAMI adopts a two stage strategy: first, identify strong main effects that implicitly carry information about important interactions. second, exploit this information through structured regularization such as group lasso to distinguish genuine main effects from interaction effects. For each selected main effect, SDAMI constructs a dedicated subnetwork, enabling nonlinear function approximation while preserving interpretability and providing a structured foundation for modeling interactions. Extensive simulations with comparisons confirm SDAMI$'$s ability to recover effect structures across diverse scenarios, while applications in reliability analysis, neuroscience, and medical diagnostics further demonstrate its versatility in addressing real-world high-dimensional modeling challenges.",

Existing studies have primarily examined personality prompting or multi-agent interactions, leaving open the question of how post-training influences the risk behavior of LLMs. In this work, we propose a new pipeline for eliciting, steering, and modulating LLMs' risk profiles, drawing on tools from behavioral economics and finance. Using utility-theoretic models, we compare pre-trained, instruction-tuned, and RLHF-aligned LLMs, and find that while instruction-tuned models exhibit behaviors consistent with some standard utility formulations, pre-trained and RLHF-aligned models deviate more from any utility models fitted. We further evaluate modulation strategies, including prompt engineering, in-context learning, and post-training, and show that post-training provides the most stable and effective modulation of risk preference. Our findings provide insights into the risk profiles of different classes and stages of LLMs and demonstrate how post-training modulates these profiles, laying the groundwork for future research on behavioral alignment and risk-aware LLM design.",

        "summary": "In machine learning, uncertainty quantification helps assess the reliability of model predictions, which is important in high-stakes scenarios. Traditional approaches often emphasize predictive accuracy, but there is a growing focus on incorporating uncertainty measures. This paper addresses localized uncertainty quantification in random forests. While current methods often rely on quantile regression or Monte Carlo techniques, we propose a new approach using naturally occurring test sets and similarity measures (proximities) typically viewed as byproducts of random forests. Specifically, we form localized distributions of OOB errors around nearby points, defined using the proximities, to create prediction intervals for regression and trust scores for classification. By varying the number of nearby points, our intervals can be adjusted to achieve the desired coverage while retaining the flexibility that reflects the certainty of individual predictions. For classification, excluding points identified as unclassifiable by our method generally enhances the accuracy of the model and provides higher accuracy-rejection AUC scores than competing methods.",

We define a means of imputing missing values conditional upon labels, the method being guided by powerful, existing supervised models designed for high accuracy in this task. From each model, we extract a tree-based proximity measure from which imputation can be applied.

A key challenge, especially in high-dimensional settings, is to determine the mixture order and estimate the mixture parameters. We study the problem of approximating a target measure, available only through finitely many of its moments, by a mixture of distributions from a parametric family (e.g., Gaussian, exponential, Poisson), with approximation quality measured by the 2-Wasserstein or the total variation distance. Unlike many existing approaches, the parameter set is not assumed to be finite; it is modeled as a compact basic semi-algebraic set. We introduce a hierarchy of semidefinite relaxations with asymptotic convergence to the desired optimal value. In addition, when a certain rank condition is satisfied, the convergence is even finite and recovery of an optimal mixing measure is obtained. We also present an application to clustering, where our framework serves either as a stand-alone method or as a preprocessing step that yields both the number of clusters and strong initial parameter estimates, thereby accelerating convergence of standard (local) clustering algorithms.",

Such settings arise naturally in federated learning, where training takes place on smartphones and other heterogeneous edge devices. In addition to varying computation speeds, these devices often hold data from different distributions. However, existing asynchronous SGD methods struggle in such heterogeneous settings and face two key limitations. First, many rely on unrealistic assumptions of similarity across workers' data distributions. Second, methods that relax this assumption still fail to achieve theoretically optimal performance under heterogeneous computation times. We introduce Ringleader ASGD, the first asynchronous SGD algorithm that attains the theoretical lower bounds for parallel first-order stochastic methods in the smooth nonconvex regime, thereby achieving optimal time complexity under data heterogeneity and without restrictive similarity assumptions. Our analysis further establishes that Ringleader ASGD remains optimal under arbitrary and even time-varying worker computation speeds, closing a fundamental gap in the theory of asynchronous optimization.",

It is thus important to have a profound understanding of the properties of the functions computed by such networks. Recently, there has been increasing interest in the (parameterized) computational complexity of determining these properties. In this work, we close several gaps and resolve an open problem posted by Froese et al. [COLT '25] regarding the parameterized complexity of various problems related to network verification. In particular, we prove that deciding positivity (and thus surjectivity) of a function $f\\colon\\mathbb{R}^d\\to\\mathbb{R}$ computed by a 2-layer ReLU network is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $d$. This result also implies that zonotope (non-)containment is W[1]-hard with respect to $d$, a problem that is of independent interest in computational geometry, control theory, and robotics. Moreover, we show that approximating the maximum within any multiplicative factor in 2-layer ReLU networks, computing the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant for $p\\in(0,\\infty]$ in 2-layer networks, and approximating the $L_p$-Lipschitz constant in 3-layer networks are NP-hard and W[1]-hard with respect to $d$. Notably, our hardness results are the strongest known so far and imply that the naive enumeration-based methods for solving these fundamental problems are all essentially optimal under the Exponential Time Hypothesis.",

Predicting end-to-end training time for multi-billion parameter models distributed across hundreds of GPUs remains challenging due to complex interactions between transformer components, parallelism strategies(data, model, pipeline, tensor), and multi-tier communication. Learned models require costly sampling, while analytical models often struggle with real-world network and hardware complexities. We address this by decomposing LLMs into core computational primitives and modeling them with: (1) operator-level decomposition for fine-grained analysis; (2) lightweight sampling based hardware-aware prediction models for key operations; (3) an end-to-end prediction system integrating these components across complex parallelization strategies. Crucially, our methodology has been validated on two large-scale HPC systems. Our framework achieves low average prediction errors-4.98\\% on Perlmutter(A100) and 9.38\\% on Vista(GH200)-for models up to 20B parameters across 128 GPUs. Importantly, it runs entirely on CPUs, enabling rapid iteration over hardware configurations and training strategies without costly on-cluster experimentation.",

Formal theorem proving systems such as Lean 4 offer automated verification with complete accuracy, motivating recent efforts to build specialized prover LLMs that generate verifiable proofs in formal languages. However, a significant gap remains: current prover LLMs solve substantially fewer problems than general-purpose LLMs operating in natural language. We introduce Hilbert, an agentic framework that bridges this gap by combining the complementary strengths of informal reasoning and formal verification. Our system orchestrates four components: an informal LLM that excels at mathematical reasoning, a specialized prover LLM optimized for Lean 4 tactics, a formal verifier, and a semantic theorem retriever. Given a problem that the prover is unable to solve, Hilbert employs recursive decomposition to split the problem into subgoals that it solves with the prover or reasoner LLM. It leverages verifier feedback to refine incorrect proofs as necessary. Experimental results demonstrate that Hilbert substantially outperforms existing approaches on key benchmarks, achieving 99.2% on miniF2F, 6.6% points above the best publicly available method. Hilbert achieves the best known result on PutnamBench. It solves 462/660 problems (70.0%), outperforming proprietary approaches like SeedProver (50.4%) and achieving a 422% improvement over the best publicly available baseline. Thus, Hilbert effectively narrows the gap between informal reasoning and formal proof generation.",

        "summary": "Open-source software projects are foundational to modern software ecosystems, with the Linux kernel standing out as a critical exemplar due to its ubiquity and complexity. Although security patches are continuously integrated into the Linux mainline kernel, downstream maintainers often delay their adoption, creating windows of vulnerability. A key reason for this lag is the difficulty in identifying security-critical patches, particularly those addressing exploitable vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds (OOB) accesses and use-after-free (UAF) bugs. This challenge is exacerbated by intentionally silent bug fixes, incomplete or missing CVE assignments, delays in CVE issuance, and recent changes to the CVE assignment criteria for the Linux kernel. While fine-grained patch classification approaches exist, they exhibit limitations in both coverage and accuracy. In this work, we identify previously unexplored opportunities to significantly improve fine-grained patch classification. Specifically, by leveraging cues from commit titles/messages and diffs alongside appropriate code context, we develop DUALLM, a dual-method pipeline that integrates two approaches based on a Large Language Model (LLM) and a fine-tuned small language model. DUALLM achieves 87.4% accuracy and an F1-score of 0.875, significantly outperforming prior solutions. Notably, DUALLM successfully identified 111 of 5,140 recent Linux kernel patches as addressing OOB or UAF vulnerabilities, with 90 true positives confirmed by manual verification (many do not have clear indications in patch descriptions). Moreover, we constructed proof-of-concepts for two identified bugs (one UAF and one OOB), including one developed to conduct a previously unknown control-flow hijack as further evidence of the correctness of the classification.",

We propose a noisy two-state gradient descent algorithm that ensures $\\rho$-zero-concentrated differential privacy by injecting carefully calibrated noise into the gradient updates. Our analysis establishes finite-sample convergence rates for the proposed method, showing that the algorithm achieves consistency while preserving privacy. In particular, we derive precise bounds quantifying the trade-off among privacy parameters, sample size, and iteration-complexity.

This enables us to derive mean and covariance for different types of CAVs, leading to a unified theoretical view.

Given a query or input, VB-Score enumerates plausible interpretations, assigns probabilities, and evaluates output by expected success penalized by variance, rewarding consistent performance across intents. We provide a formal analysis of VB-Score, establishing range, monotonicity, and stability properties, and relate it to risk-sensitive measures such as mean-variance utility. Experiments on ambiguous queries and entity-centric retrieval tasks show that VB-Score surfaces robustness differences hidden by conventional metrics.

The methodology follows a dual approach: on the one hand, surveys are conducted using specialized staff from various public entities; on the other, AI-based models (including neural networks and transformer architectures) are used to estimate the DT level of the organizations automatically. Our approach has been applied to a real-world case study involving local public administrations in the Valencian Community (Spain) and shown effective performance in assessing DT. While the proposed methodology has been validated in a specific local context, its modular structure and dual-source data foundation support its international scalability, acknowledging that administrative, regulatory, and DT maturity factors may condition its broader applicability. The experiments carried out in this work include (i) the creation of a domain-specific corpus derived from the surveys and websites of several organizations, used to train the proposed models; (ii) the use and comparison of diverse AI methods; and (iii) the validation of our approach using real data. The integration of technologies such as the IoT, sensor networks, and AI-based analytics can significantly support resilient, agile urban environments and the transition towards more effective and sustainable Smart City models.",

However, traditional heuristic-based governors are increasingly inadequate for managing the complexity of heterogeneous System-on-Chip designs and diverse application workloads. Although reinforcement learning approaches offer improved performance, their poor generalization capability and reliance on extensive retraining for each hardware and application combination leads to significant deployment costs. In this work, we observe that device and application metadata inherently encapsulate valuable knowledge for DVFS, presenting an opportunity to overcome these limitations. We formulate DVFS for heterogeneous devices and applications as a multi-task reinforcement learning problem. We introduce MetaDVFS, which is a metadata-guided framework that systematically leverages metadata to discover and transfer shared knowledge across DVFS tasks. MetaDVFS can output a set of DVFS models with significant generalization capability for various applications of heterogeneous devices. Evaluations on five Google Pixel devices running six applications show that MetaDVFS achieves up to 17% improvement in Performance-Power Ratio and up to 26% improvement in Quality of Experience. Compared to state-of-the-art methods, MetaDVFS delivers 70.8% faster adaptation and 5.8-27.6% higher performance over standalone device-application specific training, while avoiding negative transfer effects. These results establish MetaDVFS as an effective and scalable solution for DVFS deployment in heterogeneous mobile environments.",

        "summary": "Online controlled experiments (A/B tests) are fundamental to data-driven decision-making in the digital economy. However, their real-world application is frequently compromised by two critical shortcomings: the use of statistically flawed heuristics like \"p-value peeking\", which inflates false positive rates, and an over-reliance on proxy metrics like conversion rates, which can lead to decisions that inadvertently harm core business profitability. This paper addresses these challenges by introducing a comprehensive and scalable Bayesian decision framework designed for profit optimization in multi-variant (A/B/n) experiments. We propose a hierarchical Bayesian model that simultaneously estimates the probability of conversion (using a Beta-Bernoulli model) and the monetary value of that conversion (using a robust Bayesian model for the mean transaction value). Building on this, we employ a decision-theoretic stopping rule based on Expected Loss, enabling experiments to be concluded not only when a superior variant is identified but also when it becomes clear that no variant offers a practically significant improvement (stopping for futility). The framework successfully navigates \"revenue traps\" where a variant with a higher conversion rate would have resulted in a net financial loss, correctly terminates futile experiments early to conserve resources, and maintains strict statistical integrity throughout the monitoring process. Ultimately, this work provides a practical and principled methodology for organizations to move beyond simple A/B testing towards a mature, profit-driven experimentation culture, ensuring that statistical conclusions translate directly to strategic business value.",

        "summary": "Survival analysis is central to clinical research, informing patient prognoses, guiding treatment decisions, and optimising resource allocation. Accurate time-to-event predictions not only improve quality of life but also reveal risk factors that shape clinical practice. For these models to be relevant in healthcare, interpretability is critical: predictions must be traceable to patient-specific characteristics, and risk factors should be identifiable to generate actionable insights for both clinicians and researchers. Traditional survival models often fail to capture non-linear interactions, while modern deep learning approaches, though powerful, are limited by poor interpretability. We propose a Pipeline for Interpretable Survival Analysis (PISA) - a pipeline that provides multiple survival analysis models that trade off complexity and performance. Using multiple-feature, multi-objective feature engineering, PISA transforms patient characteristics and time-to-event data into multiple survival analysis models, providing valuable insights into the survival prediction task. Crucially, every model is converted into simple patient stratification flowcharts supported by Kaplan-Meier curves, whilst not compromising on performance. While PISA is model-agnostic, we illustrate its flexibility through applications of Cox regression and shallow survival trees, the latter avoiding proportional hazards assumptions. Applied to two clinical benchmark datasets, PISA produced interpretable survival models and intuitive stratification flowcharts whilst achieving state-of-the-art performances. Revisiting a prior departmental study further demonstrated its capacity to automate survival analysis workflows in real-world clinical research.",

By optimizing the transmission through the lens of the desired goal, the energy consumption of transmissions can also be reduced, and the latency can be improved.

In particular, we investigate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) handover framework that takes advantage of GenAI and semantic communication to maintain reliable connectivity. To that end, we propose a framework in which a lightweight MobileBERT language model, fine-tuned using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), is deployed on the UAV. This model processes multi-attribute flight and radio measurements and performs multi-label classification to determine appropriate handover action. Concurrently, the model identifies an appropriate set of contextual \"Reason Tags\" that elucidate the decision's rationale. Our model, evaluated on a rule-based synthetic dataset of UAV handover scenarios, demonstrates the model's high efficacy in learning these rules, achieving high accuracy in predicting the primary handover decision. The model also shows strong performance in identifying supporting reasons, with an F1 micro-score of approximately 0.9 for reason tags.",

However, as these models become increasingly more complex - often involving coupled differential equations describing the effect of specific deformation modes - their associated computational costs can become prohibitive, particularly in optimization or uncertainty quantification tasks that require numerous model evaluations. To address this challenge, surrogate constitutive models that balance accuracy and computational efficiency are highly desirable. Data-driven surrogate models, that learn the constitutive relation directly from data, have emerged as a promising solution. In this work, we develop two local surrogate models for the viscoplastic response of a steel: a piecewise response surface method and a mixture of experts model. These surrogates are designed to adapt to complex material behavior, which may vary with material parameters or operating conditions. The surrogate constitutive models are applied to creep simulations of HT-9 steel, an alloy of considerable interest to the nuclear energy sector due to its high tolerance to radiation damage, using training data generated from viscoplastic self-consistent (VPSC) simulations. We define a set of test metrics to numerically assess the accuracy of our surrogate models for predicting viscoplastic material behavior, and show that the mixture of experts model outperforms the piecewise response surface method in terms of accuracy.",

This architecture specializes general densely connected GNNs so that the model focuses more heavily on local information to prevent over smoothing. To support training large GNNs we compiled a massive new dataset of weather data, land use information, and mosquito trap results across Illinois.

In particular, we design message-passing architectures that enforce infrared and collinear (IRC) safety, as well as E(2) and O(2) equivariance in the rapidity-azimuth plane. Using simulated jet datasets, we compare these networks against unconstrained baselines in terms of classification performance, robustness to soft emissions, and latent representation structures. Our analysis shows that physics-aware networks are more stable across training instances and distribute their latent variance across multiple interpretable directions. By regressing Energy Flow Polynomials onto the leading principal components, we establish a direct correspondence between learned representations and established IRC-safe jet observables. These results demonstrate that embedding symmetry and safety constraints not only improves robustness but also grounds network representations in known QCD structures, providing a principled approach toward interpretable deep learning in collider physics.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we introduce a simple training-free technique to improve the performance of drafter-based speculative decoding (SpD) methods that incorporates language modeling head (LM head) during drafting process. A drafter-based speculative decoding leverages one or more smaller language models, a.k.a. drafters or draft models, to sample a draft sequence or tree consisting of multiple tokens, followed by verification by a base LLM, a target model, accepting a subset as its valid generation. As it is usually considered that the speculative decoding requires one-to-one mapping between vocabularies of the target model and the draft model, it has been natural to share the vocabulary between them, or even share the LM head as in EAGLE or Medusa. We first identify that this draft token sampling scheme inherently contains an unnecessary inference overhead in drafting, especially for some target LLMs with very large vocabularies. Then, we propose a simple technique, VocabTrim, to mitigate the drafting overhead to improve the generation speed in memory-bound environment. VocabTrim reconstructs the drafter LM head to contain only a limited set of tokens, selected by the most frequently sampled from the vocabulary of the target model. While limiting the vocabulary in drafting slightly degrades the acceptance rate, it significantly reduces the drafting latency in memory-bound process which is often the case on edge devices, resulting in higher memory-bound speed up (MBSU). We show that our method can boost the memory-bound speed-up for Llama-3 models on Spec-Bench, specifically by 16% for Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct.",

        "summary": "Recent studies have suggested that large language models (LLMs) underperform on mathematical and computer science tasks when these problems are translated from Romanian into English, compared to their original Romanian format. Accurate translation is critical for applications ranging from automatic translations in programming competitions to the creation of high-quality educational materials, as well as minimizing errors or fraud in human translations. This study shows that robust large language models (LLMs) can maintain or even enhance their performance in translating less common languages when given well-structured prompts. Our findings suggest that LLMs, with appropriate supervision, can be reliably used for the automatic translation of IOI (International Olympiad in Informatics)-style tasks. We evaluate several translation methods across multiple LLMs, including OpenRoLLM, Llama 3.1 8B, Llama 3.2 3B and GPT-4o, assessing their translation accuracy and performance stability through repeated runs. Additionally, we augment the OJI (Romanian County-Level Informatics Olympiad) Romanian dataset with accurate English translations, enhancing its utility for future LLM training and evaluation. Through detailed syntactic and semantic analyses, we confirm that with human oversight, LLMs can serve as a viable solution for multilingual problem-solving. We also compare the translation quality of LLMs against human translators, as evaluated by a certified expert, underscoring the potential of LLMs in realworld scenarios.",

However, the inherent biases and vulnerabilities of LLM-generated judgments raise concerns, underscoring the urgent need for distinguishing them in sensitive scenarios like academic peer reviewing. In this work, we propose and formalize the task of judgment detection and systematically investigate the detectability of LLM-generated judgments. Unlike LLM-generated text detection, judgment detection relies solely on judgment scores and candidates, reflecting real-world scenarios where textual feedback is often unavailable in the detection process. Our preliminary analysis shows that existing LLM-generated text detection methods perform poorly given their incapability to capture the interaction between judgment scores and candidate content -- an aspect crucial for effective judgment detection. Inspired by this, we introduce \\textit{J-Detector}, a lightweight and transparent neural detector augmented with explicitly extracted linguistic and LLM-enhanced features to link LLM judges' biases with candidates' properties for accurate detection. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of \\textit{J-Detector} and show how its interpretability enables quantifying biases in LLM judges. Finally, we analyze key factors affecting the detectability of LLM-generated judgments and validate the practical utility of judgment detection in real-world scenarios.",

        "summary": "Shaping powerful LLMs to be beneficial and safe is central to AI alignment. We argue that post-training alignment is fundamentally a unified Preference Learning problem, involving two modalities: demonstrated preferences (e.g., Supervised Fine-Tuning, SFT) and comparative preferences (e.g., Reinforcement Learning, RL).The standard sequential pipeline-SFT followed by RL-is flawed due to a critical distributional mismatch: SFT uses static expert data, but as the policy evolves, its generation distribution drifts, making SFT knowledge brittle. Subsequent RL then explores without direct access to the rich, ground-truth knowledge in expert demonstrations, leading to inefficient, ungrounded updates. This separation prevents mutual regularization between data sources. To address this, we reframe alignment as a constrained optimization problem and propose Unified Adversarial Preference Learning (UniAPL),a novel framework that dynamically aligns the policy's distribution with the expert's. UniAPL implements a single-stage unified training objective, jointly learning from mixed batches of SFT and preference data. In every gradient step, dense expert demonstrations directly ground and regularize online exploration, inherently resolving distributional mismatch and maximizing data synergy.We evaluate UniAPL on instruction-following tasks using Qwen3-235B-Instruct-2507 as the teacher. Our models match or exceed strong GRPO baselines: +5.77% on Qwen3-0.6B (matching a 32B model) and +3.75% on Qwen3-4B,even outperforming the teacher. Analyses of response length and log-probability distributions confirm that UniAPL outputs closely mimic expert demonstrations, achieving both stronger performance and better behavioral alignment.",

While the underlying computational principles are still debated, we hypothesize that a crucial factor is a deficit in visually-grounded serial processing. To test this hypothesis, we compared human and VLM performance across tasks designed to vary serial processing demands in three distinct domains: geometric reasoning, perceptual enumeration, and mental rotation. Tasks within each domain varied serial processing load by manipulating factors such as geometric concept complexity, perceptual individuation load, and transformation difficulty. Across all domains, our results revealed a consistent pattern: decreased VLM accuracy was strongly correlated with increased human reaction time (used as a proxy for serial processing load). As tasks require more demanding serial processing -- whether composing concepts, enumerating items, or performing mental transformations -- the VLM-human performance gap widens reliably. These findings support our hypothesis, indicating that limitations in serial, visually grounded reasoning represent a fundamental bottleneck that distinguishes current VLMs from humans.",

A key challenge in scaling such post-training is lack of high-quality downstream agentic task datasets with tasks that are diverse, feasible, and verifiable. Existing approaches for task generation rely heavily on human annotation or prompting MLLM with limited downstream environment information, which is either costly or poorly scalable as it yield tasks with limited coverage. To remedy this, we present AutoPlay, a scalable pipeline for task generation that explicitly explores interactive environments to discover possible interactions and current state information to synthesize environment-grounded tasks. AutoPlay operates in two stages: (i) an exploration phase, where an MLLM explorer agent systematically uncovers novel environment states and functionalities, and (ii) a task generation phase, where a task generator leverages exploration trajectories and a set of task guideline prompts as context to synthesize diverse, executable, and verifiable tasks. We show AutoPlay generates 20k tasks across 20 Android applications and 10k tasks across 13 applications Ubuntu applications to train mobile-use and computer-use agents. AutoPlay generated tasks enable large-scale task demonstration synthesis without human annotation by employing an MLLM task executor and verifier. This data enables training MLLM-based UI agents that improve success rates up to $20.0\\%$ on mobile-use and $10.9\\%$ on computer-use scenarios. In addition, AutoPlay generated tasks combined with MLLM verifier-based rewards enable scaling reinforcement learning training of UI agents, leading to an additional $5.7\\%$ gain. coverage. These results establish AutoPlay as a scalable approach for post-training capable MLLM agents reducing reliance on human annotation.",

        "summary": "Recently, online Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has become a key paradigm for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing methods typically treat all training samples uniformly, overlooking the vast differences in problem difficulty relative to the model's current capabilities. This uniform training strategy leads to inefficient exploration of problems the model has already mastered, while concurrently lacking effective guidance on problems that are challenging its abilities the most, limiting both learning efficiency and upper-bound performance. To address this, we propose CLPO (Curriculum-guided Learning for Policy Optimization), a novel algorithm that creates a dynamic pedagogical feedback loop within the policy optimization process. The core of CLPO leverages the model's own rollout performance to conduct real-time difficulty assessment, thereby constructing an Online Curriculum. This curriculum then guides an Adaptive Problem Restructuring mechanism, where the model acts as its own teacher: it diversifies medium-difficulty problems to promote generalization and simplifies challenging problems to make them more attainable. Our approach transforms the static training procedure into a dynamic process that co-evolves with the model's capabilities. Experiments show that CLPO achieves state-of-the-art performance across eight challenging mathematical and general reasoning benchmarks, with an average pass@1 improvement of 6.96% over other methods, demonstrating its potential for more efficiently training more capable reasoning models.",

We test SciExplorer on a broad set of models spanning mechanical dynamical systems, wave evolution, and quantum many-body physics. Despite using a minimal set of tools, primarily based on code execution, we observe impressive performance on tasks such as recovering equations of motion from observed dynamics and inferring Hamiltonians from expectation values.

        "summary": "With the tremendous advancement of deep learning and communication technology, Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) cooperative perception has the potential to address limitations in sensing distant objects and occlusion for a single-agent perception system. V2X cooperative perception systems are software systems characterized by diverse sensor types and cooperative agents, varying fusion schemes, and operation under different communication conditions. Therefore, their complex composition gives rise to numerous operational challenges. Furthermore, when cooperative perception systems produce erroneous predictions, the types of errors and their underlying causes remain insufficiently explored. To bridge this gap, we take an initial step by conducting an empirical study of V2X cooperative perception. To systematically evaluate the impact of cooperative perception on the ego vehicle's perception performance, we identify and analyze six prevalent error patterns in cooperative perception systems. We further conduct a systematic evaluation of the critical components of these systems through our large-scale study and identify the following key findings: (1) The LiDAR-based cooperation configuration exhibits the highest perception performance; (2) Vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) and vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication exhibit distinct cooperative perception performance under different fusion schemes; (3) Increased cooperative perception errors may result in a higher frequency of driving violations; (4) Cooperative perception systems are not robust against communication interference when running online. Our results reveal potential risks and vulnerabilities in critical components of cooperative perception systems. We hope that our findings can better promote the design and repair of cooperative perception systems.",

We employ adaptive deep kernel Gaussian processes, meta-learning a kernel on synthetic data generated from a normative theory. This Theory-Informed Kernel specifies a probabilistic model representing the theory predictions -- usable for both fitting data and rigorously validating the theory. As a demonstration, we apply our framework to the early visual system, using efficient coding as our normative theory. We show improved response prediction accuracy in ex vivo recordings of mouse retinal ganglion cells stimulated by natural scenes compared to conventional data-driven baselines, while providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and interpretable representations. Using exact Bayesian model selection, we also show that our informed kernel can accurately infer the degree of theory-match from data, confirming faithful encapsulation of theory structure.

        "summary": "The integration of visual understanding and generation into unified multimodal models represents a significant stride toward general-purpose AI. However, a fundamental question remains unanswered by existing benchmarks: does this architectural unification actually enable synergetic interaction between the constituent capabilities? Existing evaluation paradigms, which primarily assess understanding and generation in isolation, are insufficient for determining whether a unified model can leverage its understanding to enhance its generation, or use generative simulation to facilitate deeper comprehension. To address this critical gap, we introduce RealUnify, a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate bidirectional capability synergy. RealUnify comprises 1,000 meticulously human-annotated instances spanning 10 categories and 32 subtasks. It is structured around two core axes: 1) Understanding Enhances Generation, which requires reasoning (e.g., commonsense, logic) to guide image generation, and 2) Generation Enhances Understanding, which necessitates mental simulation or reconstruction (e.g., of transformed or disordered visual inputs) to solve reasoning tasks. A key contribution is our dual-evaluation protocol, which combines direct end-to-end assessment with a diagnostic stepwise evaluation that decomposes tasks into distinct understanding and generation phases. This protocol allows us to precisely discern whether performance bottlenecks stem from deficiencies in core abilities or from a failure to integrate them. Through large-scale evaluations of 12 leading unified models and 6 specialized baselines, we find that current unified models still struggle to achieve effective synergy, indicating that architectural unification alone is insufficient. These results highlight the need for new training strategies and inductive biases to fully unlock the potential of unified modeling.",

Its architecture features three synergistic studios: a Visual Studio to interpret diagrams, a Logic Studio to formulate solutions, and a Review Studio to perform dual-stage verification. The system coevolves through an iterative refinement loop where feedback from the Review Studio continuously guides the Logic Studio, enabling the system to self-correct and converge towards the ground truth. Evaluated on the HiPhO benchmark spanning 7 latest physics Olympiads, PhysicsMinions delivers three major breakthroughs: (i) Strong generalization: it consistently improves both open-source and closed-source models of different sizes, delivering clear benefits over their single-model baselines; (ii) Historic breakthroughs: it elevates open-source models from only 1-2 to 6 gold medals across 7 Olympiads, achieving the first-ever open-source gold medal in the latest International Physics Olympiad (IPhO) under the average-score metric; and (iii) Scaling to human expert: it further advances the open-source Pass@32 score to 26.8/30 points on the latest IPhO, ranking 4th of 406 contestants and far surpassing the top single-model score of 22.7 (ranked 22nd).

Existing methods uncover global capability circuits (e.g., indirect object identification), but not why the model answers a specific input query in a particular way. We introduce query circuits, which directly trace the information flow inside a model that maps a specific input to the output. Unlike surrogate-based approaches (e.g., sparse autoencoders), query circuits are identified within the model itself, resulting in more faithful and computationally accessible explanations. To make query circuits practical, we address two challenges. First, we introduce Normalized Deviation Faithfulness (NDF), a robust metric to evaluate how well a discovered circuit recovers the model's decision for a specific input, and is broadly applicable to circuit discovery beyond our setting. Second, we develop sampling-based methods to efficiently identify circuits that are sparse yet faithfully describe the model's behavior. Across benchmarks (IOI, arithmetic, MMLU, and ARC), we find that there exist extremely sparse query circuits within the model that can recover much of its performance on single queries. For example, a circuit covering only 1.3% of model connections can recover about 60% of performance on an MMLU questions. Overall, query circuits provide a step towards faithful, scalable explanations of how language models process individual inputs.",

However, existing multimodal time series datasets mostly remain at the level of surface alignment and question answering, without reaching the depth of genuine reasoning. The absence of well-defined tasks that genuinely require time series reasoning, along with the scarcity of high-quality data, has limited progress in building practical time series reasoning models (TSRMs). To this end, we introduce Time Series Reasoning Suite (TSR-Suite), which formalizes four atomic tasks that span three fundamental capabilities for reasoning with time series: (1) perception, acquired through scenario understanding and causality discovery; (2) extrapolation, realized via event-aware forecasting; and (3) decision-making, developed through deliberation over perception and extrapolation. TSR-Suite is the first comprehensive time series reasoning suite that supports not only thorough evaluation but also the data pipeline and training of TSRMs. It contains more than 23K samples, of which 2.3K are carefully curated through a human-guided hierarchical annotation process. Building on this foundation, we introduce TimeOmni-1, the first unified reasoning model designed to address diverse real-world problems demanding time series reasoning. The model is trained in multiple stages, integrating a mixture of task scenarios, novel reward functions, and tailored optimizations. Experiments show that TimeOmni-1 delivers strong out-of-distribution generalization across all tasks and achieves a high rate of valid responses. It significantly improves causality discovery accuracy (64.0% vs. 35.9% with GPT-4.1) and raises the valid response rate by over 6% compared to GPT-4.1 on the event-aware forecasting task.",

        "summary": "Logical reasoning is a fundamental capability of large language models (LLMs). However, existing studies largely overlook the interplay between logical complexity and semantic complexity, resulting in methods that struggle to address challenging scenarios involving abstract propositions, ambiguous contexts, and conflicting stances, which are central to human reasoning. For this gap, we propose LogicAgent, a semiotic-square-guided framework designed to jointly address logical complexity and semantic complexity. LogicAgent explicitly performs multi-perspective deduction in first-order logic (FOL), while mitigating vacuous reasoning through existential import checks that incorporate a three-valued decision scheme (True, False, Uncertain) to handle boundary cases more faithfully. Furthermore, to overcome the semantic simplicity and low logical complexity of existing datasets, we introduce RepublicQA, a benchmark that reaches college-level difficulty (FKGL = 11.94) and exhibits substantially greater lexical and structural diversity than prior benchmarks. RepublicQA is grounded in philosophical concepts, featuring abstract propositions and systematically organized contrary and contradictory relations, making it the most semantically rich resource for evaluating logical reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that LogicAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance on RepublicQA, with a 6.25% average gain over strong baselines, and generalizes effectively to mainstream logical reasoning benchmarks including ProntoQA, ProofWriter, FOLIO, and ProverQA, achieving an additional 7.05% average gain. These results highlight the strong effectiveness of our semiotic-grounded multi-perspective reasoning in boosting LLMs' logical performance.",

        "summary": "The main approach to evaluating communication is by assessing how well it facilitates coordination. If two or more individuals can coordinate through communication, it is generally assumed that they understand one another. We investigate this assumption in a signaling game where individuals develop a new vocabulary of signals to coordinate successfully. In our game, the individuals do not have common observations besides the communication signal and outcome of the interaction, i.e. received reward. This setting is used as a proxy to study communication emergence in populations of agents that perceive their environment very differently, e.g. hybrid populations that include humans and artificial agents. Agents develop signals, use them, and refine interpretations while not observing how other agents are using them. While populations always converge to optimal levels of coordination, in some cases, interacting agents interpret and use signals differently, converging to what we call successful misunderstandings. However, agents of population that coordinate using misaligned interpretations, are unable to establish successful coordination with new interaction partners. Not leading to coordination failure immediately, successful misunderstandings are difficult to spot and repair. Having at least three agents that all interact with each other are the two minimum conditions to ensure the emergence of shared interpretations. Under these conditions, the agent population exhibits this emergent property of compensating for the lack of shared observations of signal use, ensuring the emergence of shared interpretations.",

When it comes to learning subjective tasks-where there is an evident scarcity of data-this capacity needs to be recreated. In this work, we propose an intuitive human-agent teaching architecture in which the human can teach an agent how to perform a task by providing demonstrations, i.e., examples. To have an intuitive interaction, we argue that the agent should be able to learn incrementally from a few single examples. To allow for this, our objective is to broaden the agent's task understanding using domain knowledge. Then, using a learning method to enable the agent to learn efficiently from a limited number of examples. Finally, to optimize how human can select the most representative and less redundant examples to provide the agent with. We apply our proposed method to the subjective task of ingredient substitution, where the agent needs to learn how to substitute ingredients in recipes based on human examples. We replicate human input using the Recipe1MSubs dataset. In our experiments, the agent achieves half its task performance after only 100 examples are provided, compared to the complete training set of 50k examples. We show that by providing examples in strategic order along with a learning method that leverages external symbolic knowledge, the agent can generalize more efficiently.",

Centering on contextual coherence between chain-of-thought (CoT) steps, our approach is realized through a novel data annotation and training framework, which enhances the model's generalization capabilities across diverse domains. For instance, our resulting model, ContextPRM, achieves a notable 6.5% average accuracy improvement over the majority voting baseline via weighted majority voting across nine non-mathematical domains in MMLU-Pro, including law, history, and philosophy, significantly surpassing the 2.2% improvement from VersaPRM and 0.5% gains from other mathematics-focused PRMs, demonstrating consistent performance across both mathematical and non-mathematical domains.",

With the growing popularity of the Internet of Things, Artificial Intelligence, machine learning, and real-time big data analytics, there is a unique opportunity for efficient predictive maintenance to forecast equipment failures for real-time intervention and optimize maintenance actions, as traditional reactive and preventive maintenance practices are often inadequate to meet the requirements for the industry to provide quality-of-services of operations. Central to this evolution is digital twin technology, an adaptive virtual replica that continuously monitors and integrates sensor data to simulate and improve asset performance. Despite remarkable progress in digital twin implementations, such as considering DT in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering. This paper aims to address this void. We perform a retrospective analysis of the temporal evolution of the digital twin in predictive maintenance for industrial engineering to capture the applications, middleware, and technological requirements that led to the development of the digital twin from its inception to the AI-enabled digital twin and its self-learning models. We provide a layered architecture of the digital twin technology, as well as a taxonomy of the technology-enabled industrial engineering applications systems, middleware, and the used Artificial Intelligence algorithms. We provide insights into these systems for the realization of a trustworthy and efficient smart digital-twin industrial engineering ecosystem.

Our analysis reveals that the single strategy cannot adapt to problem-specific requirements and thus overlooks the trade-off between effectiveness and efficiency. To address these issues, we propose Planning and Routing through Instance-Specific Modeling (PRISM), a novel framework that decouples mathematical reasoning into two stages: strategy planning and targeted execution. Specifically, we first curate a multi-strategy preference dataset, which we call MathStrat, capturing correctness, process quality, and computational efficiency for each problem--strategy pair. Then, we train a lightweight Strategy Adapter based on the dataset to obtain confidence distributions over the mentioned four reasoning strategies. At inference time, an adaptive routing policy dynamically tailors the reasoning approach based on predictor confidence. It directs the model to use single-strategy execution for high-confidence predictions, dual-strategy verification for competitive scenarios, or comprehensive multi-strategy exploration for uncertain cases. Extensive experiments across five mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that PRISM consistently outperforms individual strategies and ensemble baselines, achieving improvements ranging from 0.9% to 7.6% across different base models. The adaptive routing approach shows particularly strong benefits for mathematical reasoning tasks across diverse model architectures. Our code is released at https://github.com/reml-group/PRISM.",

        "summary": "The quality of process data plays a key role in training a Process Reward Model (PRM), which can enhance the complex mathematical reasoning capability of large language models. Existing methods estimate the quality of reasoning steps based on a fixed-budget sampling strategy and navigate a vast search space to perform path expansion during the automated data generation process, resulting in their inefficiency and inflexibility. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Monte Carlo Search (AMCS), a framework that transforms data generation from fixed, static to adaptive, dynamic search at the level of node value estimation and path expansion. On one hand, AMCS adaptively refines estimation by allocating more samples to uncertain reasoning steps while using fewer samples for those that are easier to estimate. On the other hand, it enhances the path expansion through a Monte Carlo algorithm with a temporally adaptive policy that begins with broad exploration and gradually shifts toward exploiting the most promising directions. With AMCS, we construct a large-scale dataset MathSearch-200K of about 200K process supervision examples for training PRMs. To verify the effectiveness of our method, we conduct extensive experiments on four mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS achieves up to 76.2% accuracy on MATH500 with GLM-4-9B, outperforming all baseline PRMs. Notably, a 7B model supervised by Qwen2.5-Math-7B-PRM-AMCS surpasses a 72B model with weaker supervision.

The novel Fin-Vault dataset, consisting of 1,417 annotated multi-turn dialogues, enables Fin-Ally to extend beyond basic account management to provide personalized budgeting, real-time expense tracking, and automated financial planning.

This highlights the need for clinical reasoning agents that constrain stochasticity and hallucination while producing auditable decision flows. We introduce MedMMV, a controllable multimodal multi-agent framework for reliable and verifiable clinical reasoning. MedMMV stabilizes reasoning through diversified short rollouts, grounds intermediate steps in a structured evidence graph under the supervision of a Hallucination Detector, and aggregates candidate paths with a Combined Uncertainty scorer. On six medical benchmarks, MedMMV improves accuracy by up to 12.7% and, more critically, demonstrates superior reliability.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning but remain limited by static and incomplete parametric knowledge. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) mitigates this by incorporating external knowledge, yet existing RAGs struggle with knowledge-intensive tasks due to fragmented information and weak modeling of knowledge structure. Graphs offer a natural way to model relationships within knowledge, but LLMs are inherently unstructured and cannot effectively reason over graph-structured data. Recent graph-enhanced RAG (GraphRAG) attempts to bridge this gap by constructing tailored graphs and enabling LLMs to reason on them. However, these methods often depend on ad-hoc graph designs, heuristic search, or costly agent pipelines, which hinder scalability and generalization. To address these challenges, we present G-reasoner, a unified framework that integrates graph and language foundation models for reasoning over diverse graph-structured knowledge. Central to our approach is QuadGraph, a standardized four-layer abstraction that unifies heterogeneous knowledge sources into a common graph representation. Building on this, we introduce a 34M-parameter graph foundation model (GFM) that jointly captures graph topology and textual semantics, and is integrated with LLMs to enhance reasoning in downstream applications. To ensure scalability and efficiency, mixed-precision training and distributed message-passing are implemented to scale GFM with more GPUs. Extensive experiments on six benchmarks show that G-reasoner consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, significantly enhances LLM reasoning, and achieves strong efficiency and cross-graph generalization.",

Recent studies underscore the potential of LLMs in handling graph reasoning tasks, but their performance is underwhelming. In this work, we point out issues with existing methods and benchmarks, and rethink the direction that LLMs for graph reasoning should strive toward. We find that base models, e.g., GPT-4o-mini, are largely underestimated due to improper reasoning focus. Base models with reasoning focus redirected from replicating graph algorithms to designing them can easily solve most graph reasoning tasks in existing benchmarks. To truly evaluate the graph reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we construct a more challenging GraphAlgorithm benchmark, comprising 239 different graph problems and 3,041 test instances collected from 4 competition platforms. Finally, we introduce a simple and strong baseline Simple-Reasoning-Then-Coding (Simple-RTC)-which guides LLMs to design graph algorithms first and then code to address graph reasoning tasks. Simple-RTC achieves near-perfect accuracy on existing benchmarks and significantly outperforms GPT-4o-mini and all prior methods on the GraphAlgorithm benchmark.

        "summary": "We study empirical scaling laws for language model merging measured by cross-entropy. Despite its wide practical use, merging lacks a quantitative rule that predicts returns as we add experts or scale the model size. We identify a compact power law that links model size and expert number: the size-dependent floor decreases with model capacity, while the merging tail exhibits clear diminishing returns in the number of experts. The law holds in-domain and cross-domain, tightly fits measured curves across diverse architectures and methods (Average, TA, TIES, DARE), and explains two robust regularities: most gains arrive early, and variability shrinks as more experts are included. Building on this, we present a simple theory that explains why gains fall roughly as 1/k and links the floor and tail to properties of the base model and the diversity across domains. This law enables predictive planning: estimate how many experts are needed to reach a target loss, decide when to stop adding experts, and trade off scaling the base model versus adding experts under a fixed budget--turning merging from heuristic practice into a computationally efficient, planable alternative to multitask training. This suggests a scaling principle for distributed generative AI: predictable gains can be achieved by composing specialists, offering a complementary path toward AGI-level systems.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) enable intelligent multi-robot collaboration but face fundamental trade-offs: declarative methods lack adaptability in dynamic environments, while iterative methods incur prohibitive computational costs that scale poorly with team size and task complexity. In this paper, we propose ELHPlan, a novel framework that introduces Action Chains--sequences of actions explicitly bound to sub-goal intentions--as the fundamental planning primitive. ELHPlan operates via a cyclical process: 1) constructing intention-bound action sequences, 2) proactively validating for conflicts and feasibility, 3) refining issues through targeted mechanisms, and 4) executing validated actions. This design balances adaptability and efficiency by providing sufficient planning horizons while avoiding expensive full re-planning. We further propose comprehensive efficiency metrics, including token consumption and planning time, to more holistically evaluate multi-agent collaboration. Our experiments on benchmark TDW-MAT and C-WAH demonstrate that ELHPlan achieves comparable task success rates while consuming only 24% of the tokens required by state-of-the-art methods. Our research establishes a new efficiency-effectiveness frontier for LLM-based multi-agent planning systems.",

        "summary": "Online alignment (e.g., GRPO) is generally more performant than offline alignment (e.g., DPO) -- but why? Drawing on prospect theory from behavioral economics, we propose a human-centric explanation. We prove that online on-policy sampling better approximates the human-perceived distribution of what the model can produce, and PPO/GRPO-style clipping -- originally introduced to just stabilize training -- recovers a perceptual bias in how humans perceive probability. In this sense, PPO/GRPO act as perceptual losses already. Our theory further suggests that the online/offline dichotomy is itself incidental to maximizing human utility, since we can achieve the same effect by selectively training on any data in a manner that mimics human perception, rather than restricting ourselves to online on-policy data. Doing so would allow us to post-train more quickly, cheaply, and flexibly without sacrificing performance. To this end, we propose a design pattern that explicitly incorporates perceptual distortions of probability into objectives like DPO/KTO/GRPO, creating humanline variants of them. Surprisingly, we find that these humanline variants, even when trained with offline off-policy data, can match the performance of their online counterparts on both verifiable and unverifiable tasks.",

        "summary": "Standard human preference-based alignment methods, such as Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), are a cornerstone technology for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with human values. However, these methods are all underpinned by a critical, yet flawed assumption: human preferences are homogeneous (representing a single, unified preference) and the collected data is noiseless (free from error). In reality, neither is true since human preference is pluralistic and annotators can make mistakes. This creates a discrepancy between the recorded data and the ground-truth preferences, which can misguide the model and degrade its performance. To address this challenge, we introduce Robust Preference Optimization (RPO). RPO employs an Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm to infer the posterior probability of each label's correctness, which is used to adaptively re-weigh each data point in the training loss to mitigate noise. We further generalize this approach by establishing a theoretical link between arbitrary preference losses and their corresponding probabilistic models. This generalization enables the systematic transformation of existing alignment algorithms into their robust counterparts, elevating RPO from a specific algorithm to a meta-framework for robust preference alignment. Theoretically, we prove that under the condition of a perfectly calibrated model, RPO is guaranteed to converge to the true noise level of the dataset. Our experiments demonstrate RPO's effectiveness as a meta-framework, consistently enhancing four state-of-the-art alignment algorithms (DPO, IPO, SimPO, and CPO). When applied to Mistral and Llama 3 models, the RPO-enhanced methods achieve substantial win rate gains on AlpacaEval 2 and Arena-Hard, with improvements of up to 7.0% and 5.4%, respectively.",

        "summary": "This article presents a modular, component-based architecture for developing and evaluating AI agents that bridge the gap between natural language interfaces and complex enterprise data warehouses. The system directly addresses core challenges in data accessibility by enabling non-technical users to interact with complex data warehouses through a conversational interface, translating ambiguous user intent into precise, executable database queries to overcome semantic gaps. A cornerstone of the design is its commitment to transparent decision-making, achieved through a multi-layered reasoning framework that explains the \"why\" behind every decision, allowing for full interpretability by tracing conclusions through specific, activated business rules and data points. The architecture integrates a robust quality assurance mechanism via an automated evaluation framework that serves multiple functions: it enables performance benchmarking by objectively measuring agent performance against golden standards, and it ensures system reliability by automating the detection of performance regressions during updates. The agent's analytical depth is enhanced by a statistical context module, which quantifies deviations from normative behavior, ensuring all conclusions are supported by quantitative evidence including concrete data, percentages, and statistical comparisons. We demonstrate the efficacy of this integrated agent-development-with-evaluation framework through a case study on an insurance claims processing system. The agent, built on a modular architecture, leverages the BigQuery ecosystem to perform secure data retrieval, apply domain-specific business rules, and generate human-auditable justifications. The results confirm that this approach creates a robust, evaluable, and trustworthy system for deploying LLM-powered agents in data-sensitive, high-stakes domains.",

From a modality perspective, we review LLM-based techniques for (i) structured data (e.g., table question answering for relational data and NL2GQL for graph data), (ii) semi-structured data (e.g., markup languages understanding and semi-structured table modeling), (iii) unstructured data (e.g., chart understanding, document understanding, programming languages vulnerable detection), and (iv) heterogeneous data (e.g., data retrieval and modality alignment for data lakes).

        "summary": "Scientific discovery is often slowed by the manual development of computational tools needed to analyze complex experimental data. Building such tools is costly and time-consuming because scientists must iteratively review literature, test modeling and scientific assumptions against empirical data, and implement these insights into efficient software. Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in synthesizing literature, reasoning with empirical data, and generating domain-specific code, offering new opportunities to accelerate computational method development. Existing LLM-based systems either focus on performing scientific analyses using existing computational methods or on developing computational methods or models for general machine learning without effectively integrating the often unstructured knowledge specific to scientific domains. Here, we introduce TusoAI , an agentic AI system that takes a scientific task description with an evaluation function and autonomously develops and optimizes computational methods for the application. TusoAI integrates domain knowledge into a knowledge tree representation and performs iterative, domain-specific optimization and model diagnosis, improving performance over a pool of candidate solutions. We conducted comprehensive benchmark evaluations demonstrating that TusoAI outperforms state-of-the-art expert methods, MLE agents, and scientific AI agents across diverse tasks, such as single-cell RNA-seq data denoising and satellite-based earth monitoring. Applying TusoAI to two key open problems in genetics improved existing computational methods and uncovered novel biology, including 9 new associations between autoimmune diseases and T cell subtypes and 7 previously unreported links between disease variants linked to their target genes.

We propose an evolutionary machine learning approach, called \\ourmodel, to automatically determine whether a paper retrieved from a literature search process is relevant. \\ourmodel builds an interpretable rule-based classifier using grammar-guided genetic programming. The use of a grammar to define the syntax and the structure of the rules allows \\ourmodel to easily combine the usual textual information with other bibliometric data not considered by state-of-the-art methods.

Fibring of neural networks uses the (pre-)activations of a trained network to evaluate a fibring function computing the weights of another network whose outputs are injected back into the original network. However, the exact correspondence between fibring of neural networks and fibring of modal logics was never formally established. In this paper, we close this gap by formalizing the idea of fibred models \\emph{compatible} with fibred neural networks. Using this correspondence, we then derive non-uniform logical expressiveness results for Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), Graph Attention Networks (GATs) and Transformer encoders.

But outcome based rewards may cause reward miscalibration which means it might mistakenly allocate positive reward to flawed middle steps which is regarded as the key reason making the bad actions being reinforced during training. However we reveal that outcome based reward ensures expected negative advantage for those flawed middle steps, which means the flawed actions should be punished during training. Even accounting for the ``squeezing effect\", the probability mass of good actions should increase and the actor should gradually get rid of harmful actions. This shows that flawed actions should be punished during training. We further identify gradient coupling between similar samples as a key issue in agentic RL, the input prompt is extremely similar and the output action space is limited, therefore during training, gradients from well-performing samples can inadvertently strengthen suboptimal or incorrect actions due to similar input observation and output actions. We show that with gradient coupling, some flawed actions might be enhanced. To address this, we propose training the actor to classify good or bad actions to separate the embedding of good/bad actions and alleviate the gradient interference, extensive experiments shows its effectiveness.",

AgentGuard operates as an inspection layer that observes an agent's raw I/O and abstracts it into formal events corresponding to transitions in a state model.

        "summary": "Existing methods for evaluating the harmfulness of content generated by large language models (LLMs) have been well studied. However, approaches tailored to multimodal large language models (MLLMs) remain underdeveloped and lack depth. This work highlights the crucial role of visual information in moderating content in visual question answering (VQA), a dimension often overlooked in current research. To bridge this gap, we introduce Falcon, a large-scale vision-language safety dataset containing 57,515 VQA pairs across 13 harm categories. The dataset provides explicit annotations for harmful attributes across images, instructions, and responses, thereby facilitating a comprehensive evaluation of the content generated by MLLMs. In addition, it includes the relevant harm categories along with explanations supporting the corresponding judgments. We further propose FalconEye, a specialized evaluator fine-tuned from Qwen2.5-VL-7B using the Falcon dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that FalconEye reliably identifies harmful content in complex and safety-critical multimodal dialogue scenarios. It outperforms all other baselines in overall accuracy across our proposed Falcon-test dataset and two widely-used benchmarks-VLGuard and Beavertail-V, underscoring its potential as a practical safety auditing tool for MLLMs.",

To address these challenges, we introduce GUI-Shepherd, a Process Reward Model that provides dense, step-by-step feedback to guide agents. GUI-Shepherd is trained on a diverse large-scale data set of $52$k interactions that features human-annotated scores and GPT-4o generated rationales, enabling it to serve both as a reward provider for RL training and as a verifier for inference. As far as we know, we are the first to conduct a systematic study of process supervision in GUI agents, across diverse settings from online long-horizon tasks to offline single-step prediction. On the online AndroidWorld benchmark, GUI-Shepherd improves success rate by $7.7$ points via multi-turn online PPO, significantly outperforming Outcome Reward Model based competitors. When used as an inference verifier, it brings $5.1$ points improvements. The benefits generalize to the offline AndroidControl benchmark, with gains of $2.2$ points as a reward provider and $4.3$ points as a verifier. Collectively, our results establish that high-fidelity process supervision is critical for building more capable GUI agents and present a generalizable solution.",

        "summary": "Agentic systems consisting of multiple LLM-driven agents coordinating through tools and structured interactions, are increasingly deployed for complex reasoning and problem-solving tasks. At the same time, emerging low-code and template-based agent development platforms (e.g., Dify) enable users to rapidly build and orchestrate agentic systems, which we refer to as platform-orchestrated agentic systems. However, these systems are also fragile and it remains unclear how to systematically identify their potential failure root cause. This paper presents a study of root cause identification of these platform-orchestrated agentic systems. To support this initiative, we construct a dataset AgentFail containing 307 failure logs from ten agentic systems, each with fine-grained annotations linking failures to their root causes. We additionally utilize counterfactual reasoning-based repair strategy to ensure the reliability of the annotation. Building on the dataset, we develop a taxonomy that characterizes failure root causes and analyze their distribution across different platforms and task domains. Furthermore, we introduce a benchmark that leverages LLMs for automatically identifying root causes, in which we also utilize the proposed taxonomy as guidance for LLMs. Results show that the taxonomy can largely improve the performance, thereby confirming its utility. Nevertheless, the accuracy of root cause identification reaches at most 33.6%, which indicates that this task still remains challenging. In light of these results, we also provide actionable guidelines for building such agentic systems. In summary, this paper provides a reliable dataset of failure root cause for platform-orchestrated agentic systems, corresponding taxonomy and benchmark, which serves as a foundation for advancing the development of more reliable agentic systems.",

Existing methods primarily rely on outcome-based supervision to strengthen internal LLM reasoning, often leading to inefficient exploration and sparse rewards. To mitigate this issue, we propose Expert-Assisted Policy Optimization (EAPO), a novel RL framework that enhances exploration by incorporating multi-turn interactions with external experts during training. Unlike prior methods, where policies reason in isolation, EAPO incentivizes the policy to adaptively determine when and how to consult experts, yielding richer reward signals and more reliable reasoning trajectories. External assistance ultimately internalizes expert knowledge into the policy model, amplifying the model's inherent reasoning capabilities. During evaluation, the policy model has been well-optimized to solve questions independently, producing improved reasoning paths and more accurate solutions. Experiments on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and AIMO 2025, show that EAPO consistently outperforms expert-assisted workflow, expert-distilled models, and RL baselines, with an average gain of 5 points over self-exploratory models.",

To address this, we propose \\textsc{MedLA}, a logic-driven multi-agent framework built on large language models. Each agent organizes its reasoning process into an explicit logical tree based on syllogistic triads (major premise, minor premise, and conclusion), enabling transparent inference and premise-level alignment. Agents engage in a multi-round, graph-guided discussion to compare and iteratively refine their logic trees, achieving consensus through error correction and contradiction resolution. We demonstrate that \\textsc{MedLA} consistently outperforms both static role-based systems and single-agent baselines on challenging benchmarks such as MedDDx and standard medical QA tasks.

SAE features are typically characterized by examining their activating examples, which are often \"monosemantic\" and align with human interpretable concepts. However, these examples don't reveal feature sensitivity: how reliably a feature activates on texts similar to its activating examples. In this work, we develop a scalable method to evaluate feature sensitivity. Our approach avoids the need to generate natural language descriptions for features; instead we use language models to generate text with the same semantic properties as a feature's activating examples. We then test whether the feature activates on these generated texts. We demonstrate that sensitivity measures a new facet of feature quality and find that many interpretable features have poor sensitivity. Human evaluation confirms that when features fail to activate on our generated text, that text genuinely resembles the original activating examples. Lastly, we study feature sensitivity at the SAE level and observe that average feature sensitivity declines with increasing SAE width across 7 SAE variants. Our work establishes feature sensitivity as a new dimension for evaluating both individual features and SAE architectures.",

It teaches Small Language Models (SLMs) to mimic surface-level patterns rather than the underlying algorithmic structure of thought, resulting in a critical lack of logical robustness. We argue that instead of cloning text, distillation should transfer this algorithmic structure directly. We introduce Reasoning Scaffolding}, a framework that reframes reasoning as a structured generation process. Our method first abstracts the teacher's thought process into a sequence of discrete, interpretable semantic signals (e.g., Contrast, Addition) that act as a scaffold. The student model is then trained via a multi-task objective to both (1)predict the next semantic signal, anticipating the reasoning flow, and (2)generate the corresponding step, conditioned on that signal. This multi-task scheme acts as a powerful regularizer, compelling the student to internalize the computational patterns of coherent reasoning. On a suite of challenging reasoning benchmarks, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art distillation in both accuracy and logical consistency, providing a path towards creating smaller models that are genuine reasoners, not just fluent mimics.",

Despite recent advances, existing guardrails suffer from two fundamental limitations: (i) they apply uniform guardrail policies to all users, ignoring that the same agent behavior can harm some users while being safe for others; (ii) they check each response in isolation, missing how risks evolve and accumulate across multiple interactions. To solve these issues, we propose PSG-Agent, a personalized and dynamic system for LLM-based agents. First, PSG-Agent creates personalized guardrails by mining the interaction history for stable traits and capturing real-time states from current queries, generating user-specific risk thresholds and protection strategies. Second, PSG-Agent implements continuous monitoring across the agent pipeline with specialized guards, including Plan Monitor, Tool Firewall, Response Guard, Memory Guardian, that track cross-turn risk accumulation and issue verifiable verdicts. Finally, we validate PSG-Agent in multiple scenarios including healthcare, finance, and daily life automation scenarios with diverse user profiles. It significantly outperform existing agent guardrails including LlamaGuard3 and AGrail, providing an executable and auditable path toward personalized safety for LLM-based agents.",

        "summary": "Artificial intelligence technology plays a crucial role in recommending prescriptions for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). Previous studies have made significant progress by focusing on the symptom-herb relationship in prescriptions. However, several limitations hinder model performance: (i) Insufficient attention to patient-personalized information such as age, BMI, and medical history, which hampers accurate identification of syndrome and reduces efficacy. (ii) The typical long-tailed distribution of herb data introduces training biases and affects generalization ability. (iii) The oversight of the 'monarch, minister, assistant and envoy' compatibility among herbs increases the risk of toxicity or side effects, opposing the 'treatment based on syndrome differentiation' principle in clinical TCM. Therefore, we propose a novel hierarchical structure-enhanced personalized recommendation model for TCM formulas based on knowledge graph diffusion guidance, namely TCM-HEDPR. Specifically, we pre-train symptom representations using patient-personalized prompt sequences and apply prompt-oriented contrastive learning for data augmentation. Furthermore, we employ a KG-guided homogeneous graph diffusion method integrated with a self-attention mechanism to globally capture the non-linear symptom-herb relationship. Lastly, we design a heterogeneous graph hierarchical network to integrate herbal dispensing relationships with implicit syndromes, guiding the prescription generation process at a fine-grained level and mitigating the long-tailed herb data distribution problem. Extensive experiments on two public datasets and one clinical dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of TCM-HEDPR. In addition, we incorporate insights from modern medicine and network pharmacology to evaluate the recommended prescriptions comprehensively. It can provide a new paradigm for the recommendation of modern TCM.",

However, it also raises significant ethical concerns, including bias issues. Although numerous efforts have been made to quantify and mitigate social bias in AI models, geographic bias (in short, geo-bias) receives much less attention, which presents unique challenges. While previous work has explored ways to quantify geo-bias, these measures are model-specific (e.g., mean absolute deviation of LLM ratings) or spatially implicit (e.g., average fairness scores of all spatial partitions). We lack a model-agnostic, universally applicable, and spatially explicit geo-bias evaluation framework that allows researchers to fairly compare the geo-bias of different AI models and to understand what spatial factors contribute to the geo-bias. In this paper, we establish an information-theoretic framework for geo-bias evaluation, called GeoBS (Geo-Bias Scores). We demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed framework by showing how to interpret and analyze existing geo-bias measures under this framework. Then, we propose three novel geo-bias scores that explicitly take intricate spatial factors (multi-scalability, distance decay, and anisotropy) into consideration. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on 3 tasks, 8 datasets, and 8 models to demonstrate that both task-specific GeoAI models and general-purpose foundation models may suffer from various types of geo-bias. This framework will not only advance the technical understanding of geographic bias but will also establish a foundation for integrating spatial fairness into the design, deployment, and evaluation of AI systems.",

This work proposes ViTSP, a novel framework that leverages pre-trained vision language models (VLMs) to visually guide the solution process for large-scale TSPs. The VLMs function to identify promising small-scale subproblems from a visualized TSP instance, which are then efficiently optimized using an off-the-shelf solver to improve the global solution. ViTSP bypasses the dedicated model training at the user end while maintaining effectiveness across diverse instances. Experiments on real-world TSP instances ranging from 1k to 88k nodes demonstrate that ViTSP consistently achieves solutions with average optimality gaps below 0.2%, outperforming existing learning-based methods. Under the same runtime budget, it surpasses the best-performing heuristic solver, LKH-3, by reducing its gaps by 12% to 100%, particularly on very-large-scale instances with more than 10k nodes. Our framework offers a new perspective in hybridizing pre-trained generative models and operations research solvers in solving combinatorial optimization problems, with practical implications for integration into more complex logistics systems.

        "summary": "Binary code similarity detection is a core task in reverse engineering. It supports malware analysis and vulnerability discovery by identifying semantically similar code in different contexts. Modern methods have progressed from manually engineered features to vector representations. Hand-crafted statistics (e.g., operation ratios) are interpretable, but shallow and fail to generalize. Embedding-based methods overcome this by learning robust cross-setting representations, but these representations are opaque vectors that prevent rapid verification. They also face a scalability-accuracy trade-off, since high-dimensional nearest-neighbor search requires approximations that reduce precision. Current approaches thus force a compromise between interpretability, generalizability, and scalability. We bridge these gaps using a language model-based agent to conduct structured reasoning analysis of assembly code and generate features such as input/output types, side effects, notable constants, and algorithmic intent. Unlike hand-crafted features, they are richer and adaptive. Unlike embeddings, they are human-readable, maintainable, and directly searchable with inverted or relational indexes. Without any matching training, our method respectively achieves 42% and 62% for recall@1 in cross-architecture and cross-optimization tasks, comparable to embedding methods with training (39% and 34%). Combined with embeddings, it significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art, demonstrating that accuracy, scalability, and interpretability can coexist.",

        "summary": "Despite the impressive performance of LLM-powered agents, their adoption for Electronic Health Record (EHR) data access remains limited by the absence of benchmarks that adequately capture real-world clinical data access flows. In practice, two core challenges hinder deployment: query ambiguity from vague user questions and value mismatch between user terminology and database entries. To address this, we introduce EHR-ChatQA an interactive database question answering benchmark that evaluates the end-to-end workflow of database agents: clarifying user questions, using tools to resolve value mismatches, and generating correct SQL to deliver accurate answers. To cover diverse patterns of query ambiguity and value mismatch, EHR-ChatQA assesses agents in a simulated environment with an LLM-based user across two interaction flows: Incremental Query Refinement (IncreQA), where users add constraints to existing queries, and Adaptive Query Refinement (AdaptQA), where users adjust their search goals mid-conversation. Experiments with state-of-the-art LLMs (e.g., o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-Flash) over five i.i.d. trials show that while agents achieve high Pass@5 of 90-95% (at least one of five trials) on IncreQA and 60-80% on AdaptQA, their Pass^5 (consistent success across all five trials) is substantially lower by 35-60%. These results underscore the need to build agents that are not only performant but also robust for the safety-critical EHR domain. Finally, we provide diagnostic insights into common failure modes to guide future agent development.",

However, models employing TIR often display suboptimal behaviors, such as insufficient or excessive tool usage and overthinking after tool calls. The challenge of incentivizing LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately, while stabilizing the reasoning process, remains an open question. In this paper, we start by exploring the impact of tool calls on model reasoning from the perspective of information entropy. Our findings indicate that tool call results lead to a distinct change in the information entropy of subsequent reasoning, with the overall entropy of the reasoning chain varying based on the number of tool calls. Building on these insights, we propose Tool-Light, a framework designed to encourage LLMs to perform TIR efficiently and accurately. Our framework includes dataset construction and multi-stage fine-tuning. For dataset construction, we employ continuous self-evolved sampling using the fine-tuned model, integrating both vanilla sampling and entropy-guided sampling. Besides, we establish strict criteria for selecting positive-negative pairs during sampling. The training process involves a two-stage approach, comprising Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Self-Evolved Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Experimental results on 10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Tool-Light, significantly improving the model's efficiency in executing TIR tasks.",

Through theoretical derivation and simulation analysis, we find that the introduction of AI agents can significantly increase aggregate social output. When considering network effects among agents, this increase exhibits nonlinear growth far exceeding the simple sum of individual contributions. Under the same resource inputs, treating agents as independent producers provides higher long-term growth potential; introducing network effects further demonstrates strong characteristics of increasing returns to scale.",

        "summary": "Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents powered by Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) show significant potential for automating tasks. However, they often struggle with long-horizon tasks, leading to frequent failures. Process Reward Models (PRMs) are a promising solution, as they can guide these agents with crucial process signals during inference. Nevertheless, their application to the GUI domain presents unique challenges. When processing dense artificial inputs with long history data, PRMs suffer from a \"lost in the middle\" phenomenon, where the overwhelming historical context compromises the evaluation of the current step. Furthermore, standard PRMs lacks GUI changing awareness, providing static evaluations that are disconnected from the dynamic consequences of actions, a critical mismatch with the inherently dynamic nature of GUI tasks. In response to these challenges, we introduce GUI-PRA (Process Reward Agent for GUI Tasks), a judge agent designed to better provide process reward than standard PRM by intelligently processing historical context and actively perceiving UI state changes. Specifically, to directly combat the ``lost in the middle'' phenomenon, we introduce a dynamic memory mechanism consisting of two core components: a Relevance-based Retrieval Module to actively fetch pertinent information from long histories and a Progressive Summarization Module to dynamically condense growing interaction data, ensuring the model focuses on relevant context. Moreover, to address the lack of UI changing awareness, we introduce an Aadaptive UI Perception mechanism. This mechanism enables the agent to reason about UI state changes and dynamically select the most appropriate tool to gather grounded visual evidence, ensuring its evaluation is always informed by the current UI context.",

This integration with edge computing has led to the development of Mobile Edge General Intelligence (MEGI), which brings real-time, privacy-preserving reasoning to the network edge. However, deploying LLM-based agentic AI reasoning in MEGI environments poses significant challenges due to the high computational demands of reasoning and the limited resources of edge devices. To address these challenges, we propose a joint optimization framework for efficient LLM reasoning deployment in MEGI. First, we review methods that enhance LLM reasoning capabilities, such as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), and Mixture of Experts (MoE). Next, we present a distributed framework that addresses two correlated aspects: reasoning enhancement through adaptive CoT prompting and scalable deployment through distributed MoE architecture. The framework dynamically activates expert networks and adjusts reasoning depth based on task complexity and device capabilities. We further conduct experimental evaluations in mobile edge environments. Experimental results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in balancing reasoning quality with resource efficiency, validating the practical viability of deploying sophisticated LLM reasoning capabilities in resource-constrained MEGI environments.",

While learning-based methods offer automation, they suffer from prohibitive sample complexity and poor generalization.

AutoEP's core innovation lies in a tight synergy between two components: (1) an online Exploratory Landscape Analysis (ELA) module that provides real-time, quantitative feedback on the search dynamics, and (2) a multi-LLM reasoning chain that interprets this feedback to generate adaptive hyperparameter strategies. This approach grounds high-level reasoning in empirical data, mitigating hallucination. Evaluated on three distinct metaheuristics across diverse combinatorial optimization benchmarks, AutoEP consistently outperforms state-of-the-art tuners, including neural evolution and other LLM-based methods.

We present SysMoBench, a benchmark that evaluates AI's ability to formally model large, complex systems. We focus on concurrent and distributed systems, which are keystones of today's critical computing infrastructures, encompassing operating systems and cloud infrastructure. We use TLA+, the it de facto specification language for concurrent and distributed systems, though the benchmark can be extended to other specification languages. We address the primary challenge of evaluating AI-generated models by automating metrics like syntactic and runtime correctness, conformance to system code, and invariant correctness. SysMoBench currently includes nine diverse system artifacts: the Raft implementation of Etcd and Redis, the Spinlock and Mutex in Asterinas OS, etc.; more artifacts are being actively added.

        "summary": "This study offers a novel approach for benchmarking complex cognitive behavior in artificial systems. Almost universally, Large Language Models (LLMs) perform best on tasks which may be included in their training data and can be accomplished solely using natural language, limiting our understanding of their emergent sophisticated cognitive capacities. In this work, we created dozens of novel items of a classic mental imagery task from cognitive psychology. A task which, traditionally, cognitive psychologists have argued is solvable exclusively via visual mental imagery (i.e., language alone would be insufficient). LLMs are perfect for testing this hypothesis. First, we tested several state-of-the-art LLMs by giving text-only models written instructions and asking them to report the resulting object after performing the transformations in the aforementioned task. Then, we created a baseline by testing 100 human subjects in exactly the same task. We found that the best LLMs performed significantly above average human performance. Finally, we tested reasoning models set to different levels of reasoning and found the strongest performance when models allocate greater amounts of reasoning tokens. These results provide evidence that the best LLMs may have the capability to complete imagery-dependent tasks despite the non-pictorial nature of their architectures. Our study not only demonstrates an emergent cognitive capacity in LLMs while performing a novel task, but it also provides the field with a new task that leaves lots of room for improvement in otherwise already highly capable models. Finally, our findings reignite the debate over the formats of representation of visual imagery in humans, suggesting that propositional reasoning (or at least non-imagistic reasoning) may be sufficient to complete tasks that were long-thought to be imagery-dependent.",

Its asymmetry of information and reliance on theory-of-mind reasoning mirror real-world multi-agent scenarios, making it a useful testbed for evaluating the social intelligence of large language models (LLMs). To support a systematic study, we introduce Mini-Mafia: a simplified four-player variant with one mafioso, one detective, and two villagers. We set the mafioso to kill a villager and the detective to investigate the mafioso during the night, reducing the game to a single day phase of discussion and voting. This setup isolates three interactive capabilities through role-specific win conditions: the mafioso must deceive, the villagers must detect deception, and the detective must effectively disclose information. To measure these skills, we have LLMs play against each other, creating the Mini-Mafia Benchmark: a two-stage framework that first estimates win rates within fixed opponent configurations, then aggregates performance across them using standardized scoring. Built entirely from model interactions without external data, the benchmark evolves as new models are introduced, with each one serving both as a new opponent and as a subject of evaluation. Our experiments reveal counterintuitive results, including cases where smaller models outperform larger ones. Beyond benchmarking, Mini-Mafia enables quantitative study of emergent multi-agent dynamics such as name bias and last-speaker advantage. It also contributes to AI safety by generating training data for deception detectors and by tracking models' deception capabilities against human baselines.",

However, sometimes new data and associated hypotheses derived from data are not consistent with existing theory because the existing theory is incomplete or incorrect. Automating abductive inference to close this gap remains open. We propose a solution: an algebraic geometry-based system that, given an incomplete axiom system and a hypothesis that it cannot explain, automatically generates a minimal set of missing axioms that suffices to derive the axiom, as long as axioms and hypotheses are expressible as polynomial equations. We formally establish necessary and sufficient conditions for the successful retrieval of such axioms.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong persuasive capabilities comparable to those of humans, offering promising benefits while raising societal concerns about their deployment. However, systematically evaluating the persuasive capabilities of LLMs is inherently challenging, as the effectiveness of persuasion among humans varies significantly across different domains. In this paper, we take a theory-driven approach to provide a scalable and principled framework for measuring the persuasive capabilities of LLMs. Grounded in the Bayesian Persuasion (BP) framework, we repurpose existing human-human persuasion datasets to construct environments for evaluating and training LLMs in strategic persuasion. Our results reveal that frontier models can consistently achieve high persuasion gains and exhibit sophisticated persuasion strategies that align with theoretical predictions. Building on this, we use reinforcement learning to train LLMs for strategic persuasion in our environments. Our results also demonstrate that even small LLMs can obtain significantly higher persuasion gains through reinforcement learning.",

        "summary": "This study explores whether large language models can exhibit behavioral patterns similar to human gambling addictions. As LLMs are increasingly utilized in financial decision-making domains such as asset management and commodity trading, understanding their potential for pathological decision-making has gained practical significance. We systematically analyze LLM decision-making at cognitive-behavioral and neural levels based on human gambling addiction research. In slot machine experiments, we identified cognitive features of human gambling addiction, such as illusion of control, gambler's fallacy, and loss chasing. When given the freedom to determine their own target amounts and betting sizes, bankruptcy rates rose substantially alongside increased irrational behavior, demonstrating that greater autonomy amplifies risk-taking tendencies. Through neural circuit analysis using a Sparse Autoencoder, we confirmed that model behavior is controlled by abstract decision-making features related to risky and safe behaviors, not merely by prompts. These findings suggest LLMs can internalize human-like cognitive biases and decision-making mechanisms beyond simply mimicking training data patterns, emphasizing the importance of AI safety design in financial applications.",

        "summary": "Urban railway systems increasingly rely on communication based train control (CBTC) systems, where optimal deployment of access points (APs) in tunnels is critical for robust wireless coverage. Traditional methods, such as empirical model-based optimization algorithms, are hindered by excessive measurement requirements and suboptimal solutions, while machine learning (ML) approaches often struggle with complex tunnel environments. This paper proposes a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) driven framework that integrates parabolic wave equation (PWE) channel modeling, conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) based data augmentation, and a dueling deep Q network (Dueling DQN) for AP placement optimization. The PWE method generates high-fidelity path loss distributions for a subset of AP positions, which are then expanded by the cGAN to create high resolution path loss maps for all candidate positions, significantly reducing simulation costs while maintaining physical accuracy. In the DRL framework, the state space captures AP positions and coverage, the action space defines AP adjustments, and the reward function encourages signal improvement while penalizing deployment costs. The dueling DQN enhances convergence speed and exploration exploitation balance, increasing the likelihood of reaching optimal configurations. Comparative experiments show that the proposed method outperforms a conventional Hooke Jeeves optimizer and traditional DQN, delivering AP configurations with higher average received power, better worst-case coverage, and improved computational efficiency. This work integrates high-fidelity electromagnetic simulation, generative modeling, and AI-driven optimization, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for next-generation CBTC systems in complex tunnel environments.",

We leverage a Gaussian assumption to draw curves showing how moving on a Pareto surface helps administer such a trade-off better than simply relying on optimal rate-distortion compression and hoping that compressed signals can be distinguished from each other.",

        "summary": "The very expressiveness of Bayesian networks can introduce fresh challenges due to the large number of relationships they often model. In many domains, it is thus often essential to supplement any available data with elicited expert judgements. This in turn leads to two key challenges: the cognitive burden of these judgements is often very high, and there are a very large number of judgements required to obtain a full probability model. We can mitigate both issues by introducing assumptions such as independence of causal influences (ICI) on the local structures throughout the network, restricting the parameter space of the model. However, the assumption of ICI is often unjustified and overly strong. In this paper, we introduce the surjective independence of causal influences (SICI) model which relaxes the ICI assumption and provides a more viable, practical alternative local structure model that facilitates efficient Bayesian network parameterisation.",

        "summary": "To automatically tune configurations for the best possible system performance (e.g., runtime or throughput), much work has been focused on designing intelligent heuristics in a tuner. However, existing tuner designs have mostly ignored the presence of complex performance requirements (e.g., the latency shall ideally be 2 seconds), but simply assume that better performance is always more preferred. This would not only waste valuable information in a requirement but might also consume extensive resources to tune for a goal with little gain. Yet, prior studies have shown that simply incorporating the requirement as a tuning objective is problematic since the requirement might be too strict, harming convergence; or its highly diverse satisfactions might lead to premature convergence. In this paper, we propose CoTune, a tool that takes the information of a given target performance requirement into account through co-evolution. CoTune is unique in the sense that it creates an auxiliary performance requirement to be co-evolved with the configurations, which assists the target performance requirement when it becomes ineffective or even misleading, hence allowing the tuning to be guided by the requirement while being robust to its harm. Experiment results on 162 cases (nine systems and 18 requirements) reveal that CoTune considerably outperforms existing tuners, ranking as the best for 90% cases (against the 0%--35% for other tuners) with up to 2.9x overall improvements, while doing so under a much better efficiency.",

        "summary": "Geofences have attracted significant attention in the design of spatial and virtual regions for managing and engaging spatiotemporal events. By using geofences to monitor human activity across their boundaries, content providers can create spatially triggered events that include notifications about points of interest within a geofence by pushing spatial information to the devices of users. Traditionally, geofences were hand-crafted by providers. In addition to the hand-crafted approach, recent advances in collecting human mobility data through mobile devices can accelerate the automatic and data-driven design of geofences, also known as the geofence design problem. Previous approaches assume circular shapes; thus, their flexibility is insufficient, and they can only handle geofence-based applications for large areas with coarse resolutions. A challenge with using circular geofences in urban and high-resolution areas is that they often overlap and fail to align with political district boundaries and road segments, such as one-way streets and median barriers. In this study, we address the problem of extracting arbitrary shapes as geofences from human mobility data to mitigate this problem. In our formulation, we cast the existing optimization problems for circular geofences to 0-1 integer programming problems to represent arbitrary shapes. Although 0-1 integer programming problems are computationally hard, formulating them as quadratic (unconstrained) binary optimization problems enables efficient approximation of optimal solutions, because this allows the use of specialized quadratic solvers, such as the quantum annealing, and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We then develop and compare different formulation methods to extract discrete geofences. We confirmed that our new modeling approach enables flexible geofence design.",

They combine structural topology with node attributes through message passing and pooling. However, their robustness or lack of thereof with respect to different perturbations and targeted attacks in conjunction with community detection tasks is not well understood. To shed light into latent mechanisms behind GNN sensitivity on community detection tasks, we conduct a systematic computational evaluation of six widely adopted GNN architectures: GCN, GAT, Graph- SAGE, DiffPool, MinCUT, and DMoN. The analysis covers three perturbation categories: node attribute manipulations, edge topology distortions, and adversarial attacks. We use element-centric similarity as the evaluation metric on synthetic benchmarks and real-world citation networks. Our findings indicate that supervised GNNs tend to achieve higher baseline accuracy, while unsupervised methods, particularly DMoN, maintain stronger resilience under targeted and adversarial pertur- bations. Furthermore, robustness appears to be strongly influenced by community strength, with well-defined communities reducing performance loss. Across all models, node attribute perturba- tions associated with targeted edge deletions and shift in attribute distributions tend to cause the largest degradation in community recovery. These findings highlight important trade-offs between accuracy and robustness in GNN-based community detection and offer new insights into selecting architectures resilient to noise and adversarial attacks.",

Building upon this foundation, PoseDiff extends naturally to video-to-action inverse dynamics: by conditioning on sparse video keyframes generated by world models, it produces smooth and continuous long-horizon action sequences through an overlap-averaging strategy. This unified design enables scalable and efficient integration of perception and control.

Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in task-solving performance on complex real-world robotic tasks, showcasing effective self-regulation of VLMs, coherent tool collaboration, and adaptive evolution of the framework during execution.

This modular, agent-based approach allows for robust data processing, deep theoretical understanding, creative composition, and realistic audio synthesis, culminating in a system capable of generating sophisticated and contextually appropriate higher-voice harmonies for given melodies.",

These statements purport to establish risk thresholds and safety procedures for the development and deployment of highly capable AI. Understanding which AI risks are covered and what actions are allowed, refused, demanded, encouraged, or discouraged by these statements is vital for assessing how these frameworks actually govern AI development and deployment. We draw on affordance theory to analyse the OpenAI 'Preparedness Framework Version 2' (April 2025) using the Mechanisms & Conditions model of affordances and the MIT AI Risk Repository. We find that this safety policy requests evaluation of a small minority of AI risks, encourages deployment of systems with 'Medium' capabilities for what OpenAI itself defines as 'severe harm' (potential for >1000 deaths or >$100B in damages), and allows OpenAI's CEO to deploy even more dangerous capabilities. These findings suggest that effective mitigation of AI risks requires more robust governance interventions beyond current industry self-regulation. Our affordance analysis provides a replicable method for evaluating what safety frameworks actually permit versus what they claim.",

        "summary": "Generative planners based on flow matching (FM) can produce high-quality paths in one or a few ODE steps, but their sampling dynamics offer no formal safety guarantees and can yield incomplete paths near constraints. We present SafeFlowMatcher, a planning framework that couples FM with control barrier functions (CBFs) to achieve both real-time efficiency and certified safety. SafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a prediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a candidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path with a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program that minimally perturbs the vector field. We prove a barrier certificate for the resulting flow system, establishing forward invariance of a robust safe set and finite-time convergence to the safe set. By enforcing safety only on the executed path (rather than on all intermediate latent paths), SafeFlowMatcher avoids distributional drift and mitigates local trap problems. Across maze navigation and locomotion benchmarks, SafeFlowMatcher attains faster, smoother, and safer paths than diffusion- and FM-based baselines. Extensive ablations corroborate the contributions of the PC integrator and the barrier certificate.",

Data-driven approaches have emerged as a solution to this bottleneck, replacing costly simulations with rapid neural network evaluations and enabling near-instant design for meta-atoms. Despite advances, implementing a new optical function still requires building and training a task-specific network, along with exhaustive searches for suitable architectures and hyperparameters. Pre-trained large language models (LLMs), by contrast, sidestep this laborious process with a simple fine-tuning technique. However, applying LLMs to the design of nanophotonic devices, particularly for arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces, is still in its early stages; as such tasks often require graphical networks. Here, we show that an LLM, fed with descriptive inputs of arbitrarily shaped metasurface geometries, can learn the physical relationships needed for spectral prediction and inverse design. We further benchmarked a range of open-weight LLMs and identified relationships between accuracy and model size at the billion-parameter level. We demonstrated that 1-D token-wise LLMs provide a practical tool to designing 2-D arbitrarily shaped metasurfaces. Linking natural-language interaction to electromagnetic modelling, this \"chat-to-chip\" workflow represents a step toward more user-friendly data-driven nanophotonics.",

        "summary": "Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.",

        "summary": "Active vision (AV) has been in the spotlight of robotics research due to its emergence in numerous applications including agricultural tasks such as precision crop monitoring and autonomous harvesting to list a few. A major AV problem that gained popularity is the 3D reconstruction of targeted environments using 2D images from diverse viewpoints. While collecting and processing a large number of arbitrarily captured 2D images can be arduous in many practical scenarios, a more efficient solution involves optimizing the placement of available cameras in 3D space to capture fewer, yet more informative, images that provide sufficient visual information for effective reconstruction of the environment of interest. This process termed as view planning (VP), can be markedly challenged (i) by noise emerging in the location of the cameras and/or in the extracted images, and (ii) by the need to generalize well in other unknown similar agricultural environments without need for re-optimizing or re-training. To cope with these challenges, the present work presents a novel VP framework that considers a reconstruction quality-based optimization formulation that relies on the notion of `structure-from-motion' to reconstruct the 3D structure of the sought environment from the selected 2D images. With no analytic expression of the optimization function and with costly function evaluations, a Bayesian optimization approach is proposed to efficiently carry out the VP process using only a few function evaluations, while accounting for different noise cases. Numerical tests on both simulated and real agricultural settings signify the benefits of the advocated VP approach in efficiently estimating the optimal camera placement to accurately reconstruct 3D environments of interest, and generalize well on similar unknown environments.",

While recent advances in Software Engineering agents have shown promise in automated bug fixing, existing benchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness and fail to evaluate agents' abilities to identify and resolve non-functional issues like performance bugs. We introduce PerfBench, a benchmark comprising 81 real-world performance bug-fixing tasks from popular .NET repositories on GitHub. Unlike existing benchmarks that rely on pre-existing test suites, PerfBench features a novel evaluation harness that allows agents to generate their own performance benchmarks and validates fixes by comparing execution metrics collected for developer fix and agent fix. Each task in PerfBench is derived from actual developer fixes linked to performance-related issues, which are then verified by human experts, ensuring real-world relevance. Our evaluation reveals that current state-of-the-art coding agents struggle with performance optimization tasks, with baseline OpenHands agent achieving only a ~3% success rate on our benchmark. We develop OpenHands-Perf-Agent, which incorporates performance-aware tooling and instructions and achieves a ~20% success rate on the benchmark. We show that by ensuring the agent has proper instructions to benchmark its changes and tooling for benchmark output processing, we can improve the agent performance significantly, but room for improvement still remains. PerfBench provides a challenging test set for furthering the capabilities of agents in fixing performance issues.",

Existing approaches based on multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), safety filtering, or Model Predictive Control (MPC) either lack strict safety guarantees, suffer from conservatism, or fail to scale effectively. We propose MAD-PINN, a decentralized physics-informed machine learning framework for solving the multi-agent state-constrained optimal control problem (MASC-OCP). Our method leverages an epigraph-based reformulation of SC-OCP to simultaneously capture performance and safety, and approximates its solution via a physics-informed neural network. Scalability is achieved by training the SC-OCP value function on reduced-agent systems and deploying them in a decentralized fashion, where each agent relies only on local observations of its neighbours for decision-making. To further enhance safety and efficiency, we introduce an Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability-based neighbour selection strategy to prioritize safety-critical interactions, and a receding-horizon policy execution scheme that adapts to dynamic interactions while reducing computational burden. Experiments on multi-agent navigation tasks demonstrate that MAD-PINN achieves superior safety-performance trade-offs, maintains scalability as the number of agents grows, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",

While such strategies can be used directly for networks with varied connectivity and dynamic conditions, developing generalizable approaches that are effective on scenarios significantly different from the training environment remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a framework to address the challenge of generalizability by (i) developing a generalizable base model considering diverse mobile network scenarios, and (ii) using the generalizable base model for new scenarios, and when needed, fine-tuning the base model using a small amount of data from the new scenarios. To support this framework, we first design new features to characterize network variation and feature quality, thereby improving the information used in DRL-based forwarding decisions. We then develop a continual learning (CL) approach able to train DRL models across diverse network scenarios without ``catastrophic forgetting.'' Using extensive evaluation, including real-world scenarios in two cities, we show that our approach is generalizable to unseen mobility scenarios. Compared to a state-of-the-art heuristic forwarding strategy, it leads to up to 78% reduction in delay, 24% improvement in delivery rate, and comparable or slightly higher number of forwards.",

Despite their dual nature, prior work has addressed them independently. In this paper we propose a unified framework that jointly models EPR and APT by disentangling note-level score content and global performance style representations from both paired and unpaired data. Our framework is built on a transformer-based sequence-to-sequence architecture and is trained using only sequence-aligned data, without requiring fine-grained note-level alignment. To automate the rendering process while ensuring stylistic compatibility with the score, we introduce an independent diffusion-based performance style recommendation module that generates style embeddings directly from score content. This modular component supports both style transfer and flexible rendering across a range of expressive styles. Experimental results from both objective and subjective evaluations demonstrate that our framework achieves competitive performance on EPR and APT tasks, while enabling effective content-style disentanglement, reliable style transfer, and stylistically appropriate rendering.

The key advantages of this work are: (1) the proposal of a multi-level retrieval scheme, with products and attribute values as distinct hierarchical levels in PAVI domain (2) attribute value generation of large language model to significantly alleviate the OOD problem and (3) its successful deployment in a real-world industrial environment.

These hallucinations can be exploited in software supply chain attacks, where malicious attackers exploit them to register harmful packages. It is critical to test LLMs for package hallucinations to mitigate package hallucinations and defend against potential attacks. Although researchers have proposed testing frameworks for fact-conflicting hallucinations in natural language generation, there is a lack of research on package hallucinations. To fill this gap, we propose HFUZZER, a novel phrase-based fuzzing framework to test LLMs for package hallucinations. HFUZZER adopts fuzzing technology and guides the model to infer a wider range of reasonable information based on phrases, thereby generating enough and diverse coding tasks. Furthermore, HFUZZER extracts phrases from package information or coding tasks to ensure the relevance of phrases and code, thereby improving the relevance of generated tasks and code. We evaluate HFUZZER on multiple LLMs and find that it triggers package hallucinations across all selected models. Compared to the mutational fuzzing framework, HFUZZER identifies 2.60x more unique hallucinated packages and generates more diverse tasks. Additionally, when testing the model GPT-4o, HFUZZER finds 46 unique hallucinated packages. Further analysis reveals that for GPT-4o, LLMs exhibit package hallucinations not only during code generation but also when assisting with environment configuration.",

To address this challenge, researchers have proposed various techniques for automating unit test generation, including traditional heuristic-based methods and more recent approaches that leverage large language models (LLMs).

As a result, they often struggle to achieve adequate coverage, particularly for deep or complex execution paths. In this work, we present a path-sensitive framework, JUnitGenie, to fill this gap by combining code knowledge with the semantic capabilities of LLMs in guiding context-aware unit test generation. After extracting code knowledge from Java projects, JUnitGenie distills this knowledge into structured prompts to guide the generation of high-coverage unit tests. We evaluate JUnitGenie on 2,258 complex focal methods from ten real-world Java projects. The results show that JUnitGenie generates valid tests and improves branch and line coverage by 29.60% and 31.00% on average over both heuristic and LLM-based baselines.

First, we train massive scale RL on procedurally generated robots with aggressive domain randomization. Second, in contrast to previous policies that are myopic with short context lengths, we extend context by orders of magnitude to span episode boundaries. We deploy the same LocoFormer to varied robots and show robust control even with large disturbances such as weight change and motor failures. In extreme scenarios, we see emergent adaptation across episodes, LocoFormer learns from falls in early episodes to improve control strategies in later ones. We believe that this simple, yet general recipe can be used to train foundation models for other robotic skills in the future. Videos at generalist-locomotion.github.io.",

        "summary": "Guidance methods have demonstrated significant improvements in cross-modal audio generation, including text-to-audio (T2A) and video-to-audio (V2A) generation. The popularly adopted method, classifier-free guidance (CFG), steers generation by emphasizing condition alignment, enhancing fidelity but often at the cost of diversity. Recently, autoguidance (AG) has been explored for audio generation, encouraging the sampling to faithfully reconstruct the target distribution and showing increased diversity. Despite these advances, they usually rely on a single guiding principle, e.g., condition alignment in CFG or score accuracy in AG, leaving the full potential of guidance for audio generation untapped. In this work, we explore enriching the composition of the guidance method and present a mixture-of-guidance framework, AudioMoG. Within the design space, AudioMoG can exploit the complementary advantages of distinctive guiding principles by fulfilling their cumulative benefits. With a reduced form, AudioMoG can consider parallel complements or recover a single guiding principle, without sacrificing generality. We experimentally show that, given the same inference speed, AudioMoG approach consistently outperforms single guidance in T2A generation across sampling steps, concurrently showing advantages in V2A, text-to-music, and image generation. These results highlight a \"free lunch\" in current cross-modal audio generation systems: higher quality can be achieved through mixed guiding principles at the sampling stage without sacrificing inference efficiency.

However, increasing heterogeneity in model architectures exacerbates pipeline bubbles, thereby reducing training efficiency. Existing approaches overlook the co-optimization of model partition, model placement, and workload scheduling, resulting in limited efficiency improvement or even performance degradation. To respond, we propose AdaPtis, an LLM training system that supports adaptive pipeline parallelism. First, we develop a pipeline performance model to accurately estimate training throughput. Second, AdaPtis jointly optimizes model partition, model placement, and workload scheduling policies guided by this performance model. Third, we design a unified pipeline executor that efficiently supports the execution of diverse pipeline strategies. Extensive experiments show that AdaPtis achieves an average speedup of 1.42x (up to 2.14x) over Megatron-LM I-1F1B across various LLM architectures and scales.",

This paper propose a secure and spectral efficient ISAC framework for multi-UAV networks, and a two-stage optimization approach is developed to jointly design hybrid beamforming (HBF), artificial noise (AN) injection, and UAV trajectories. Aiming at maximizing the sum secrecy rate, the first stage employs Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize digital beamformers and trajectories, and the second stage decomposes the digital solution into analog and digital components via low-complexity matrix factorization.

Efficiency is largely neglected in existing studies and agent products, and this paper fills the gap by introducing an inference-time trajectory reduction approach to reduce the cost of agents. Through analyzing existing agent trajectories, we demonstrate that useless, redundant, and expired information is widespread in all trajectories, which can be identified and reduced without harming the agent's performance. We then design a simple yet effective trajectory reduction approach, AgentDiet, which automatically removes such waste information. We implement AgentDiet on a top-performing coding agent, and the evaluation on two LLMs and two benchmarks shows that AgentDiet can reduce input tokens by 39.9% ~ 59.7%, or the final computational cost by 21.1% ~ 35.9%, while maintaining the same agent performance. This indicates that trajectory reduction is a promising direction for agent systems.",

In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections, we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for enhancing threat analysis. However, their effectiveness in real-world blue team threat-hunting scenarios remains insufficiently explored. This paper presents CyberTeam, a benchmark designed to guide LLMs in blue teaming practice. CyberTeam constructs a standardized workflow in two stages. First, it models realistic threat-hunting workflows by capturing the dependencies among analytical tasks from threat attribution to incident response. Next, each task is addressed through a set of operational modules tailored to its specific analytical requirements. This transforms threat hunting into a structured sequence of reasoning steps, with each step grounded in a discrete operation and ordered according to task-specific dependencies. Guided by this framework, LLMs are directed to perform threat-hunting tasks through modularized steps. Overall, CyberTeam integrates 30 tasks and 9 operational modules to guide LLMs through standardized threat analysis. We evaluate both leading LLMs and state-of-the-art cybersecurity agents, comparing CyberTeam against open-ended reasoning strategies. Our results highlight the improvements enabled by standardized design, while also revealing the limitations of open-ended reasoning in real-world threat hunting.",

        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances Large Language Models by grounding their outputs in external documents. These systems, however, remain vulnerable to attacks on the retrieval corpus, such as prompt injection. RAG-based search systems (e.g., Google's Search AI Overview) present an interesting setting for studying and protecting against such threats, as defense algorithms can benefit from built-in reliability signals -- like document ranking -- and represent a non-LLM challenge for the adversary due to decades of work to thwart SEO. Motivated by, but not limited to, this scenario, this work introduces ReliabilityRAG, a framework for adversarial robustness that explicitly leverages reliability information of retrieved documents. Our first contribution adopts a graph-theoretic perspective to identify a \"consistent majority\" among retrieved documents to filter out malicious ones. We introduce a novel algorithm based on finding a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) on a document graph where edges encode contradiction. Our MIS variant explicitly prioritizes higher-reliability documents and provides provable robustness guarantees against bounded adversarial corruption under natural assumptions. Recognizing the computational cost of exact MIS for large retrieval sets, our second contribution is a scalable weighted sample and aggregate framework. It explicitly utilizes reliability information, preserving some robustness guarantees while efficiently handling many documents. We present empirical results showing ReliabilityRAG provides superior robustness against adversarial attacks compared to prior methods, maintains high benign accuracy, and excels in long-form generation tasks where prior robustness-focused methods struggled. Our work is a significant step towards more effective, provably robust defenses against retrieved corpus corruption in RAG.",

In addition, to demonstrate the effectiveness of the dataset, we introduced ARP-Eval, a dual-aspect evaluation framework that assesses both response quality and role fidelity. Empirical validation showing GLM-4-Voice trained on AudioRole (which we called ARP-Model) achieve an average Acoustic Personalization score of 0.31, significantly outperforming the original GLM-4-voice and the more powerful model MiniCPM-O-2.6, which specifically supports role-playing in one-shot scenarios. The ARP-Model also achieves a Content Personalization score of 0.36, surpassing the untrained original model by about 38% and maintaining the same level as MiniCPM-O-2.6.

To help redress this imbalance, we build NeuroBridge, an online platform that utilizes large language models (LLMs) to simulate: (a) an AI character that is direct and literal, a style common among many autistic individuals, and (b) four cross-neurotype communication scenarios in a feedback-driven conversation between this character and a neurotypical user. Through NeuroBridge, neurotypical individuals gain a firsthand look at autistic communication, and reflect on their role in shaping cross-neurotype interactions. In a user study with 12 neurotypical participants, we find that NeuroBridge improved their understanding of how autistic people may interpret language differently, with all describing autism as a social difference that \"needs understanding by others\" after completing the simulation. Participants valued its personalized, interactive format and described AI-generated feedback as \"constructive\", \"logical\" and \"non-judgmental\". Most perceived the portrayal of autism in the simulation as accurate, suggesting that users may readily accept AI-generated (mis)representations of disabilities. To conclude, we discuss design implications for disability representation in AI, the need for making NeuroBridge more personalized, and LLMs' limitations in modeling complex social scenarios.",

This paper offers a first attempt at a taxonomy to organize the diverse narratives of AI education and to inform discipline-based curricular discussions. We place these narratives within the enduring responsibility of higher education: the mission of knowledge. This mission includes not only the preservation and advancement of disciplinary expertise, but also the cultivation of skills and wisdom, i.e., forms of meta-knowledge that encompass judgment, ethics, and social responsibility. For the purpose of this paper's discussion, AI is defined as adaptive, data-driven systems that automate analysis, modeling, and decision-making, highlighting its dual role as enabler and disruptor across disciplines. We argue that the most consequential challenges lie at the level of curriculum and disciplinary purpose, where AI accelerates inquiry but also unsettles expertise and identity. We show how disciplines evolve through the interplay of research, curriculum, pedagogy, and faculty expertise, and why curricular reform is the central lever for meaningful change. Pedagogical innovation offers a strategic and accessible entry point, providing actionable steps that help faculty and students build the expertise needed to engage in deeper curricular rethinking and disciplinary renewal. Within this framing, we suggest that meaningful reform can move forward through structured faculty journeys: from AI literacy to pedagogy, curriculum design, and research integration. The key is to align these journeys with the mission of knowledge, turning the disruptive pressures of AI into opportunities for disciplines to sustain expertise, advance inquiry, and serve society.",

This paper highlights that mobile Neural Processing Units (NPUs) have underutilized computational resources, particularly their matrix multiplication units, during typical LLM inference. To leverage this wasted compute capacity, we propose applying parallel test-time scaling techniques on mobile NPUs to enhance the performance of smaller LLMs. However, this approach confronts inherent NPU challenges, including inadequate hardware support for fine-grained quantization and low efficiency in general-purpose computations. To overcome these, we introduce two key techniques: a hardware-aware tile quantization scheme that aligns group quantization with NPU memory access patterns, and efficient LUT-based replacements for complex operations such as Softmax and dequantization. We design and implement an end-to-end inference system that leverages the NPU's compute capability to support test-time scaling on Qualcomm Snapdragon platforms. Experiments show our approach brings significant speedups: up to 19.0 for mixed-precision GEMM and 2.2 for Softmax. More importantly, we demonstrate that smaller models using test-time scaling can match or exceed the accuracy of larger models, achieving a new performance-cost Pareto frontier.",

        "summary": "With the emergence of Web 2.0 and microservices architecture, the number of Web APIs has increased dramatically, further intensifying the demand for efficient Web API recommendation. Existing solutions typically fall into two categories: recommendation-type methods, which treat each API as a label for classification, and match-type methods, which focus on matching mashups through API retrieval. However, three critical challenges persist: 1) the semantic ambiguities in comparing API and mashup descriptions, 2) the lack of detailed comparisons between the individual API and the mashup in recommendation-type methods, and 3) time inefficiencies for API retrieval in match-type methods. To address these challenges, we propose WARBERT, a hierarchical BERT-based model for Web API recommendation. WARBERT leverages dual-component feature fusion and attention comparison to extract precise semantic representations of API and mashup descriptions. WARBERT consists of two main components: WARBERT(R) for Recommendation and WARBERT(M) for Matching. Specifically, WAR-BERT(R) serves as an initial filter, narrowing down the candidate APIs, while WARBERT(M) refines the matching process by calculating the similarity between candidate APIs and mashup. The final likelihood of a mashup being matched with an API is determined by combining the predictions from WARBERT(R) and WARBERT(M). Additionally, WARBERT(R) incorporates an auxiliary task of mashup category judgment, which enhances its effectiveness in candidate selection. Experimental results on the ProgrammableWeb dataset demonstrate that WARBERT outperforms most existing solutions and achieves improvements of up to 11.7% compared to the model MTFM (Multi-Task Fusion Model), delivering significant enhancements in accuracy and effiency.",

However, in dynamic remote scenes, transmission latency during bidirectional communication creates gaps between remote perceived states and operator intent, leading to command misunderstanding and incorrect execution. To mitigate this, we introduce the Spatio-Temporal Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph (ST-OVSG), a representation that enriches open-vocabulary perception with temporal dynamics and lightweight latency annotations. ST-OVSG leverages LVLMs to construct open-vocabulary 3D object representations, and extends them into the temporal domain via Hungarian assignment with our temporal matching cost, yielding a unified spatio-temporal scene graph. A latency tag is embedded to enable LVLM planners to retrospectively query past scene states, thereby resolving local-remote state mismatches caused by transmission delays. To further reduce redundancy and highlight task-relevant cues, we propose a task-oriented subgraph filtering strategy that produces compact inputs for the planner. ST-OVSG generalizes to novel categories and enhances planning robustness against transmission latency without requiring fine-tuning. Experiments show that our method achieves 74 percent node accuracy on the Replica benchmark, outperforming ConceptGraph. Notably, in the latency-robustness experiment, the LVLM planner assisted by ST-OVSG achieved a planning success rate of 70.5 percent.",

QMoE also has the advantage of only taking MoE models into account and does not evaluate its use with non mixture of expert systems. Although this prior attempt focuses on the limitations of large servers with the latest NVIDIA hardware which in the case of the H100 and V100 which have 80 GB of HBM (High Bandwidth Memory), what is not being considered is a significantly more constrained environment, such as in the case of mobile devices which may have in the case of the iPhone anywhere from 4 to 8 GB of unified memory which also needs to be shared with the operating system and additional processes. Although edge devices such as phones and laptops are becoming increasingly more computationally powerful, they are still not close to the level of advanced server machines such as NVIDIA. An additional constraint that we must consider is that of latency. The communication time of sending a request to an LLM server and then getting it back is an additional waiting time that can be removed.

In this work, we propose a novel dual-branch encoder-decoder architecture for unsupervised speech enhancement that separates the input into clean speech and residual noise. Adversarial training is employed to impose priors on each branch, defined by unpaired datasets of clean speech and, optionally, noise. Experimental results show that our method achieves performance comparable to leading unsupervised speech enhancement approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the critical impact of clean speech data selection on enhancement performance. In particular, our findings reveal that performance may appear overly optimistic when in-domain clean speech data are used for prior definition -- a practice adopted in previous unsupervised speech enhancement studies.",

RSS-based methods are widely deployable as RSS data is available on all Wi-Fi-capable devices, but RSS is highly sensitive to multipath, channel variations, and receiver characteristics. While supervised learning methods offer improved robustness, they require large amounts of labeled data, which is often costly to obtain. We introduce a lightweight framework that solves this by automating high-resolution synchronized RSS-location data collection using a short, camera-assisted calibration phase. An overhead camera is calibrated only once with ArUco markers and then tracks a device collecting RSS data from broadcast packets of nearby access points across Wi-Fi channels. The resulting (x, y, RSS) dataset is used to automatically train mobile-deployable localization algorithms, avoiding the privacy concerns of continuous video monitoring. We quantify the accuracy limits of such vision-assisted RSS data collection under key factors such as tracking precision and label synchronization. Using the collected experimental data, we benchmark traditional and supervised learning approaches under varying signal conditions and device types, demonstrating improved accuracy and generalization, validating the utility of the proposed framework for practical use.

        "summary": "Rearranging objects in cluttered tabletop environments remains a long-standing challenge in robotics. Classical planners often generate inefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed buffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to resolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense scenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from reaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra buffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports another, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these issues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced. Inspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary, movable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both feasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in large-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art rearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89% in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density settings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through experiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper. These findings establish dynamic buffering as a key primitive for cost-efficient and robust rearrangement planning.",

In the absence of explicit feedback, such erroneous implicit signals may severely mislead recommender systems. In this paper, we propose MTRec, a novel sequential recommendation framework designed to align with real user preferences by uncovering their internal satisfaction on recommended items. Specifically, we introduce a mental reward model to quantify user satisfaction and propose a distributional inverse reinforcement learning approach to learn it. The learned mental reward model is then used to guide recommendation models to better align with users' real preferences. Our experiments show that MTRec brings significant improvements to a variety of recommendation models.

Existing approaches often depend on limited labeled datasets, which restricts their ability to generalize to rare or unseen disturbances. This paper proposes a novel framework that integrates generative modeling, sliding-window temporal processing, and decision fusion to achieve robust event detection and classification using synchrophasor data. A variational autoencoder-generative adversarial network is employed to model normal operating conditions, where both reconstruction error and discriminator error are extracted as anomaly indicators. Two complementary decision strategies are developed: a threshold-based rule for computational efficiency and a convex hull-based method for robustness under complex error distributions. These features are organized into spatiotemporal detection and classification matrices through a sliding-window mechanism, and an identification and decision fusion stage integrates the outputs across PMUs. This design enables the framework to identify known events while systematically classifying previously unseen disturbances into a new category, addressing a key limitation of supervised classifiers. Experimental results demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy, surpassing machine learning, deep learning, and envelope-based baselines.

        "summary": "Recent large language models (LLMs) have increasingly adopted the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture for efficiency. MoE-based LLMs heavily depend on a superficial safety mechanism in which harmful inputs are routed safety-critical experts. However, our analysis reveals that routing decisions for harmful inputs drift significantly after fine-tuning, exposing a critical vulnerability to harmful fine-tuning (HFT) attacks. Existing defenses, primarily designed for monolithic LLMs, are less effective for MoE LLMs as they fail to prevent drift in harmful input routing. To address this limitation, we propose SafeMoE, a safe fine-tuning method tailored to MoE LLMs. SafeMoE directly mitigates routing drift by penalizing the gap between the routing weights of a fine-tuned model and those of the initial safety-aligned model, thereby preserving the safety-aligned routing of harmful inputs to safety-critical experts. Experiments on open-source MoE LLMs ranging from 7B to 141B parameters demonstrate that SafeMoE effectively mitigates HFT attacks, reducing the harmfulness score of OLMoE from 62.0 to 5.0, for example, while maintaining task utility within 1% degradation and incurring only 2% overhead. It significantly outperforms state-of-the-art defense methods for safeguarding LLM fine-tuning and remains effective in recent large-scale MoE LLMs such as gpt-oss and Llama 4. Our implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SafeMoE.",

However, challenges persist for domain-specific terminology, and short utterances lacking semantic coherence, where recognition performance often degrades significantly. In this work, we present Index-MSR, an efficient multimodal speech recognition framework. At its core is a novel Multimodal Fusion Decoder (MFD), which effectively incorporates text-related information from videos (e.g., subtitles and presentation slides) into the speech recognition. This cross-modal integration not only enhances overall ASR accuracy but also yields substantial reductions in substitution errors. Extensive evaluations on both an in-house subtitle dataset and a public AVSR dataset demonstrate that Index-MSR achieves sota accuracy, with substitution errors reduced by 20,50%. These results demonstrate that our approach efficiently exploits text-related cues from video to improve speech recognition accuracy, showing strong potential in applications requiring strict audio text synchronization, such as audio translation.",

We offer (1) agency as a system property operationalized along the dimensions of preference rigidity, independent operation, and goal persistence, (2) a representation engineering approach to the measurement and control of the agency of an LLM-based agent, and (3) regulatory tools enabled by this approach: mandated testing protocols, domain-specific agency limits, insurance frameworks that price risk based on agency, and agency ceilings to prevent societal-scale risks.

Traditional model-based methods rely on the full PF model to implement power flow analysis. In practice, however, some PF model parameters can be inaccurate or even unavailable due to the uncertainties or dynamics in the power systems. Moreover, because the power network keeps evolving with possibly changing topology, the generalizability of a PF model to different network sizes and typologies should be considered. In this paper, we propose a PF rebuild model based on graph attention networks (GAT) by constructing a new graph based on the real and imaginary parts of voltage at each bus. By comparing with two state-of-the-art PF rebuild models for different standard IEEE power system cases and their modified topology variants, we demonstrate the feasibility of our method. Experimental results show that our proposed model achieves better accuracy for a changing network and can generalize to different networks with less accuracy discount.",

Existing defense research primarily focuses on single-turn attacks, whereas multi-turn jailbreak attacks progressively break through safeguards through by concealing malicious intent and tactical manipulation, ultimately rendering conventional single-turn defenses ineffective. To address this critical challenge, we propose the Bidirectional Intention Inference Defense (BIID). The method integrates forward request-based intention inference with backward response-based intention retrospection, establishing a bidirectional synergy mechanism to detect risks concealed within seemingly benign inputs, thereby constructing a more robust guardrails that effectively prevents harmful content generation. The proposed method undergoes systematic evaluation compared with a no-defense baseline and seven representative defense methods across three LLMs and two safety benchmarks under 10 different attack methods. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly reduces the Attack Success Rate (ASR) across both single-turn and multi-turn jailbreak attempts, outperforming all existing baseline methods while effectively maintaining practical utility. Notably, comparative experiments across three multi-turn safety datasets further validate the proposed model's significant advantages over other defense approaches.",

However, the choice of guidance scale remains underexplored: a fixed scale often fails to generalize across prompts of varying complexity, leading to oversaturation or weak alignment. We address this gap by introducing a prompt-aware framework that predicts scale-dependent quality and selects the optimal guidance at inference. Specifically, we construct a large synthetic dataset by generating samples under multiple scales and scoring them with reliable evaluation metrics. A lightweight predictor, conditioned on semantic embeddings and linguistic complexity, estimates multi-metric quality curves and determines the best scale via a utility function with regularization. Experiments on MSCOCO~2014 and AudioCaps show consistent improvements over vanilla CFG, enhancing fidelity, alignment, and perceptual preference. This work demonstrates that prompt-aware scale selection provides an effective, training-free enhancement for pretrained diffusion backbones.",

Overall, the impact of LLMs on student learning is positive but uneven. Strong effects emerge in qualification, particularly when LLMs function as tutors in sustained interventions. Socialisation outcomes appear more variable, concentrated in sustained, reflective interventions. Subjectification, linked to autonomy and learner development, remains fragile, with improvements confined to small-scale, long-term studies. This purpose-level view highlights design as the decisive factor: without scaffolds for participation and agency, LLMs privilege what is easiest to measure while neglecting broader aims of education.

This paper introduces MASTAVN (Multi-Agent Scalable Transformer Audio-Visual Navigation), a scalable framework enabling two agents to collaboratively localize and navigate toward an audio target in shared 3D environments. By integrating cross-agent communication protocols and joint audio-visual fusion mechanisms, MASTAVN enhances spatial reasoning and temporal synchronization. Through rigorous evaluation in photorealistic 3D simulators (Replica and Matterport3D), MASTAVN achieves significant reductions in task completion time and notable improvements in navigation success rates compared to single-agent and non-collaborative baselines. This highlights the essential role of spatiotemporal coordination in multi-agent systems.

This is a highly regarded and widely applied research task in the field of intelligent transportation, and there have been many research results to date. Traditional POI prediction models primarily rely on short-term traffic sequence information, often neglecting both long-term and short-term preference data, as well as crucial spatiotemporal context features in user behavior. To address this issue, this paper introduces user long-term preference information and key spatiotemporal context information, and proposes a POI recommendation model based on multimodal spatiotemporal context feature embedding. The model extracts long-term preference features and key spatiotemporal context features from traffic data through modules such as spatiotemporal feature processing, multimodal embedding, and self-attention aggregation. It then uses a weighted fusion method to dynamically adjust the weights of long-term and short-term features based on users' historical behavior patterns and the current context. Finally, the fused features are matched using attention, and the probability of each location candidate becoming the next location is calculated. This paper conducts experimental verification on multiple transportation datasets, and the results show that the POI prediction model combining multiple types of features has higher prediction accuracy than existing SOTA models and methods.",

This problem also extends to domain-specific search systems that utilize a Knowledge Base (KB) to access data from various research infrastructures. Research infrastructures (RIs) from the environmental and earth science domain, which encompass the study of ecosystems, biodiversity, oceanography, and climate change, generate, share, and reuse large volumes of data.

To address these challenges, we proposed an automated method to curate a domain-specific evaluation dataset to analyze the capability of a search system. Furthermore, we incorporate the Retrieval of Augmented Generation (RAG), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for high-quality retrieval of environmental domain data using natural language queries.

        "summary": "This work aims to formalize some of the ways scientific concepts are formed in the process of theoretical physics discovery. Since this may at first seem like a task beyond the scope of the exact sciences (natural and formal sciences), we begin by presenting arguments for why scientific concept formation can be formalized. Then, we introduce type theory as a natural and well-suited framework for this formalization. We formalize what we call \"ways of discovering new concepts\" including concept distinction, property preservation, and concept change, as cognitive typing rules. Next, we apply these cognitive typing rules to two case studies of conceptual discovery in the history of physics: Einstein's reasoning leading to the impossibility of frozen waves, and his conceptual path to the relativity of time. In these historical episodes, we recast what a physicist might informally call \"ways of discovering new scientific concepts\" as compositional typing rules built from cognitive typing rules - thus formalizing them as scientific discovery mechanisms. Lastly, we computationally model the type-theoretic reconstruction of Einstein's conceptual path to the relativity of time as a program synthesis task.",

        "summary": "In this paper, a green learning (GL)-based precoding framework is proposed for simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS)-aided millimeter-wave (mmWave) MIMO broadcasting systems. Motivated by the growing emphasis on environmental sustainability in future 6G networks, this work adopts a broadcasting transmission architecture for scenarios where multiple users share identical information, improving spectral efficiency and reducing redundant transmissions and power consumption. Different from conventional optimization methods, such as block coordinate descent (BCD) that require perfect channel state information (CSI) and iterative computation, the proposed GL framework operates directly on received uplink pilot signals without explicit CSI estimation. Unlike deep learning (DL) approaches that require CSI-based labels for training, the proposed GL approach also avoids deep neural networks and backpropagation, leading to a more lightweight design. Although the proposed GL framework is trained with supervision generated by BCD under full CSI, inference is performed in a fully CSI-free manner. The proposed GL integrates subspace approximation with adjusted bias (Saab), relevant feature test (RFT)-based supervised feature selection, and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-based decision learning to jointly predict the STAR-RIS coefficients and transmit precoder. Simulation results show that the proposed GL approach achieves competitive spectral efficiency compared to BCD and DL-based models, while reducing floating-point operations (FLOPs) by over four orders of magnitude. These advantages make the proposed GL approach highly suitable for real-time deployment in energy- and hardware-constrained broadcasting scenarios.",

SL must share licensed spectrum with cellular communications (CC) and unlicensed bands with Wi-Fi, posing significant challenges for coexistence. Unlike prior rule-based or threshold-based methods, the proposed agentic scheduler autonomously perceives queueing dynamics, channel conditions, and coexistence states, and adapts its policy to maintain quality-of-service (QoS). Simulation results show that our framework reduces the blocking rate by up to 87.5% compared to threshold-based scheduling under limited licensed bandwidth. These findings demonstrate the potential of Agentic AI to enable stable, QoS-aware, and adaptive scheduling for future NR SL systems.",

Yet the lack of standardized evaluation frameworks has led to data leakage and over-optimistic claims, as prior studies often rely on homogeneous datasets and inconsistent experimental setups. To promote a fair evaluation process, we present BenLOC, a comprehensive benchmark and open-source toolkit, which not only offers an end-to-end pipeline for learning instance-wise MIP optimizer configurations, but also standardizes dataset selection, train-test splits, feature engineering and baseline choice for unbiased and comprehensive evaluations. Leveraging this framework, we conduct an empirical analysis on five well-established MIP datasets and compare classical machine learning models with handcrafted features against state-of-the-art deep-learning techniques. The results demonstrate the importance of datasets, features and baseline criteria proposed by BenLOC and the effectiveness of BenLOC in providing unbiased and comprehensive evaluations.",

Inspired by this, we propose a voice conversion (VC) model within the VALLE-X framework, leveraging its strong in-context learning capabilities for speaker adaptation. To enhance prosody control, we introduce a prosody-aware audio codec encoder (PACE) module, which isolates and refines prosody from other sources, improving expressiveness and control. By integrating PACE into our VC model, we achieve greater flexibility in prosody manipulation while preserving speaker timbre. Experimental evaluation results demonstrate that our approach outperforms baseline VC systems in prosody preservation, timbre consistency, and overall naturalness, surpassing baseline VC systems.",
