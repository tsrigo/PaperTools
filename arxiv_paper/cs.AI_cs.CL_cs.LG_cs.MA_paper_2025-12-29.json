        "summary": "As autonomous vehicle technology advances, ensuring the safety and reliability of these systems becomes paramount. Consequently, comprehensive testing methodologies are essential to evaluate the performance of autonomous vehicles in diverse and complex real-world scenarios. This study focuses on the behaviour coverage analysis of a multi-agent system simulation designed for autonomous vehicle testing, and provides a systematic approach to measure and assess behaviour coverage within the simulation environment. By defining a set of driving scenarios, and agent interactions, we evaluate the extent to which the simulation encompasses a broad range of behaviours relevant to autonomous driving. Our findings highlight the importance of behaviour coverage in validating the effectiveness and robustness of autonomous vehicle systems. Through the analysis of behaviour coverage metrics and coverage-based testing, we identify key areas for improvement and optimization in the simulation framework. Thus, a Model Predictive Control (MPC) pedestrian agent is proposed, where its objective function is formulated to encourage \\textit{interesting} tests while promoting a more realistic behaviour than other previously studied pedestrian agents. This research contributes to advancing the field of autonomous vehicle testing by providing insights into the comprehensive evaluation of system behaviour in simulated environments. The results offer valuable implications for enhancing the safety, reliability, and performance of autonomous vehicles through rigorous testing methodologies.",

        "summary": "Heterogeneity is a fundamental property in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL), which is closely related not only to the functional differences of agents, but also to policy diversity and environmental interactions. However, the MARL field currently lacks a rigorous definition and deeper understanding of heterogeneity. This paper systematically discusses heterogeneity in MARL from the perspectives of definition, quantification, and utilization. First, based on an agent-level modeling of MARL, we categorize heterogeneity into five types and provide mathematical definitions. Second, we define the concept of heterogeneity distance and propose a practical quantification method. Third, we design a heterogeneity-based multi-agent dynamic parameter sharing algorithm as an example of the application of our methodology. Case studies demonstrate that our method can effectively identify and quantify various types of agent heterogeneity. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm, compared to other parameter sharing baselines, has better interpretability and stronger adaptability. The proposed methodology will help the MARL community gain a more comprehensive and profound understanding of heterogeneity, and further promote the development of practical algorithms.",

A central challenge is the end-to-end training of such systems without restrictive architectural or training assumptions. Such tasks fit the theory and approaches of the collaborative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) field. We introduce Reinforcement Networks, a general framework for MARL that organizes agents as vertices in a directed acyclic graph (DAG). This structure extends hierarchical RL to arbitrary DAGs, enabling flexible credit assignment and scalable coordination while avoiding strict topologies, fully centralized training, and other limitations of current approaches. We formalize training and inference methods for the Reinforcement Networks framework and connect it to the LevelEnv concept to support reproducible construction, training, and evaluation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several collaborative MARL setups by developing several Reinforcement Networks models that achieve improved performance over standard MARL baselines. Beyond empirical gains, Reinforcement Networks unify hierarchical, modular, and graph-structured views of MARL, opening a principled path toward designing and training complex multi-agent systems. We conclude with theoretical and practical directions - richer graph morphologies, compositional curricula, and graph-aware exploration. That positions Reinforcement Networks as a foundation for a new line of research in scalable, structured MARL.",

We introduce Hierarchical Pedagogical Oversight (HPO), a framework that adapts structured adversarial synthesis to educational assessment. Unlike cooperative multi-agent systems that often drift toward superficial consensus, HPO enforces a dialectical separation of concerns: specialist agents first distill dialogue context, which then grounds a moderated, five-act debate between opposing pedagogical critics. We evaluate this framework on the MRBench dataset of 1,214 middle-school mathematics dialogues. Our 8B-parameter model achieves a Macro F1 of 0.845, outperforming GPT-4o (0.812) by 3.3% while using 20 times fewer parameters. These results establish adversarial reasoning as a critical mechanism for deploying reliable, low-compute pedagogical oversight in resource-constrained environments.",

In contrast to regular multi-agent path-finding, the solver finds and updates the assignment of goals to the agents on its own. In the continuous case for a point agent with motions in the Euclidean plane, the problem can be solved arbitrarily close to optimal. For discrete variants that incur node and edge conflicts, we show that it can be solved in polynomial time, which is unexpected, since traditional vehicle routing on general graphs is NP-hard. We implement a corresponding planner that finds conflict-free optimized routes for the agents. Global assignment strategies greatly reduce the number of conflicts, with the remaining ones resolved by elaborating on the concept of ants-on-the-stick, by solving local assignment problems, by interleaving agent paths, and by kicking agents that have already arrived out of their destinations",

Conventional approaches often rely on fixed probabilistic models or classifiers, which can be brittle under partial observability and limited interaction. Large language models (LLMs) offer a flexible alternative: by mapping short behavioral traces into high-level hypotheses, they can serve as world models over teammate behavior. We introduce \\Collab, a language-based framework that classifies partner types using a behavior rubric derived from trajectory features, and extend it to \\ReCollab, which incorporates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to stabilize inference with exemplar trajectories. In the cooperative Overcooked environment, \\Collab effectively distinguishes teammate types, while \\ReCollab consistently improves adaptation across layouts, achieving Pareto-optimal trade-offs between classification accuracy and episodic return. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs as behavioral world models for AHT and highlight the importance of retrieval grounding in challenging coordination settings.",

While full browser interaction could unlock deeper capabilities, its fine-grained control and verbose page content returns introduce substantial complexity for ReAct-style function-calling agents. To bridge this gap, we propose Nested Browser-Use Learning (NestBrowse), which introduces a minimal and complete browser-action framework that decouples interaction control from page exploration through a nested structure. This design simplifies agentic reasoning while enabling effective deep-web information acquisition. Empirical results on challenging deep IS benchmarks demonstrate that NestBrowse offers clear benefits in practice. Further in-depth analyses underscore its efficiency and flexibility.",

        "summary": "In collective systems, the available agents are a limited resource that must be allocated among tasks to maximize collective performance. Computing the optimal allocation of several agents to numerous tasks through a brute-force approach can be infeasible, especially when each task's performance scales differently with the increase of agents. For example, difficult tasks may require more agents to achieve similar performances compared to simpler tasks, but performance may saturate nonlinearly as the number of allocated agents increases. We propose a computationally efficient algorithm, based on marginal performance gains, for optimally allocating agents to tasks with concave scalability functions, including linear, saturating, and retrograde scaling, to achieve maximum collective performance. We test the algorithm by allocating a simulated robot swarm among collective decision-making tasks, where embodied agents sample their environment and exchange information to reach a consensus on spatially distributed environmental features. We vary task difficulties by different geometrical arrangements of environmental features in space (patchiness). In this scenario, decision performance in each task scales either as a saturating curve (following the Condorcet's Jury Theorem in an interference-free setup) or as a retrograde curve (when physical interference among robots restricts their movement). Using simple robot simulations, we show that our algorithm can be useful in allocating robots among tasks. Our approach aims to advance the deployment of future real-world multi-robot systems.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have been largely driven by scaling laws for individual models, which predict performance improvements as model parameters and data volume increase. However, the capabilities of any single LLM are inherently bounded. One solution originates from intricate interactions among multiple LLMs, rendering their collective performance surpasses that of any constituent model. Despite the rapid proliferation of multi-model integration techniques such as model routing and post-hoc ensembling, a unifying theoretical framework of performance scaling for multi-model collaboration remains absent. In this work, we propose the Law of Multi-model Collaboration, a scaling law that predicts the performance limits of LLM ensembles based on their aggregated parameter budget. To quantify the intrinsic upper bound of multi-model collaboration, we adopt a method-agnostic formulation and assume an idealized integration oracle where the total cross-entropy loss of each sample is determined by the minimum loss of any model in the model pool. Experimental results reveal that multi-model systems follow a power-law scaling with respect to the total parameter count, exhibiting a more significant improvement trend and a lower theoretical loss floor compared to single model scaling. Moreover, ensembles of heterogeneous model families achieve better performance scaling than those formed within a single model family, indicating that model diversity is a primary driver of collaboration gains. These findings suggest that model collaboration represents a critical axis for extending the intelligence frontier of LLMs.",

However, this presents three key system challenges - model architecture diversity, kernel primitive diversity, and hardware generation and architecture heterogeneity. This paper presents KernelEvolve-an agentic kernel coding framework-to tackle heterogeneity at-scale for DLRM. KernelEvolve is designed to take kernel specifications as input and automate the process of kernel generation and optimization for recommendation model across heterogeneous hardware architectures. KernelEvolve does so by operating at multiple programming abstractions, from Triton and CuTe DSL to low-level hardware agnostic languages, spanning the full hardware-software optimization stack. The kernel optimization process is described as graph-based search with selection policy, universal operator, fitness function, and termination rule, dynamically adapts to runtime execution context through retrieval-augmented prompt synthesis. We designed, implemented, and deployed KernelEvolve to optimize a wide variety of production recommendation models across generations of NVIDIA and AMD GPUs, as well as Meta's AI accelerators. We validate KernelEvolve on the publicly-available KernelBench suite, achieving 100% pass rate on all 250 problems across three difficulty levels, and 160 PyTorch ATen operators across three heterogeneous hardware platforms, demonstrating 100% correctness. KernelEvolve reduces development time from weeks to hours and achieves substantial performance improvements over PyTorch baselines across diverse production use cases and for heterogeneous AI systems at-scale. Beyond performance efficiency improvements, KernelEvolve significantly mitigates the programmability barrier for new AI hardware by enabling automated kernel generation for in-house developed AI hardware.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often falter at complex planning tasks that require exploration and self-correction, as their linear reasoning process struggles to recover from early mistakes. While search algorithms like Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) can explore alternatives, they are often ineffective when guided by sparse rewards and fail to leverage the rich semantic capabilities of LLMs. We introduce SPIRAL (Symbolic LLM Planning via Grounded and Reflective Search), a novel framework that embeds a cognitive architecture of three specialized LLM agents into an MCTS loop. SPIRAL's key contribution is its integrated planning pipeline where a Planner proposes creative next steps, a Simulator grounds the search by predicting realistic outcomes, and a Critic provides dense reward signals through reflection. This synergy transforms MCTS from a brute-force search into a guided, self-correcting reasoning process. On the DailyLifeAPIs and HuggingFace datasets, SPIRAL consistently outperforms the default Chain-of-Thought planning method and other state-of-the-art agents. More importantly, it substantially surpasses other state-of-the-art agents; for example, SPIRAL achieves 83.6% overall accuracy on DailyLifeAPIs, an improvement of over 16 percentage points against the next-best search framework, while also demonstrating superior token efficiency. Our work demonstrates that structuring LLM reasoning as a guided, reflective, and grounded search process yields more robust and efficient autonomous planners.

This paper presents a trust-based delegated consensus framework integrating Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) with Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) for privacy-preserving policy evaluation, combined with learning-based defense mechanisms. We systematically compare three reinforcement learning approaches -- tabular Q-learning (RL), Deep RL with Dueling Double DQN (DRL), and Multi-Agent RL (MARL) -- against five distinct attack families: Naive Malicious Attack (NMA), Collusive Rumor Attack (CRA), Adaptive Adversarial Attack (AAA), Byzantine Fault Injection (BFI), and Time-Delayed Poisoning (TDP). Experimental results on a 16-node simulated IoT network reveal significant performance variations: MARL achieves superior detection under collusive attacks (F1=0.85 vs. DRL's 0.68 and RL's 0.50), while DRL and MARL both attain perfect detection (F1=1.00) against adaptive attacks where RL fails (F1=0.50). All agents successfully defend against Byzantine attacks (F1=1.00). Most critically, the Time-Delayed Poisoning attack proves catastrophic for all agents, with F1 scores dropping to 0.11-0.16 after sleeper activation, demonstrating the severe threat posed by trust-building adversaries.

However, when homogeneous groups (three instances of the same model) engaged in the same process, no benefit was observed.

        "summary": "In collective motion, perceptually-limited individuals move in an ordered manner, without centralized control. The perception of each individual is highly localized, as is its ability to interact with others. While natural collective motion is robust, most artificial swarms are brittle. This particularly occurs when vision is used as the sensing modality, due to ambiguities and information-loss inherent in visual perception. This paper presents mechanisms for robust collective motion inspired by studies of locusts. First, we develop a robust distance estimation method that combines visually perceived horizontal and vertical sizes of neighbors. Second, we introduce intermittent locomotion as a mechanism that allows robots to reliably detect peers that fail to keep up, and disrupt the motion of the swarm. We show how such faulty robots can be avoided in a manner that is robust to errors in classifying them as faulty. Through extensive physics-based simulation experiments, we show dramatic improvements to swarm resilience when using these techniques. We show these are relevant to both distance-based Avoid-Attract models, as well as to models relying on Alignment, in a wide range of experiment settings.",

We evaluate three state-of-the-art LLM coding agents (Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, and Gemini) across 300 projects generated from 100 standardized prompts in Python, JavaScript, and Java. We introduce a three-layer dependency framework (distinguishing between claimed, working, and runtime dependencies) to quantify execution reproducibility. Our results show that only 68.3% of projects execute out-of-the-box, with substantial variation across languages (Python 89.2%, Java 44.0%).

        "summary": "Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) holds great promise for the development of autonomous agents under complex GUI tasks, but its scalability remains severely hampered by the verification of task completion. Existing task verification is treated as a passive, post-hoc process: a verifier (i.e., rule-based scoring script, reward or critic model, and LLM-as-a-Judge) analyzes the agent's entire interaction trajectory to determine if the agent succeeds. Such processing of verbose context that contains irrelevant, noisy history poses challenges to the verification protocols and therefore leads to prohibitive cost and low reliability. To overcome this bottleneck, we propose SmartSnap, a paradigm shift from this passive, post-hoc verification to proactive, in-situ self-verification by the agent itself. We introduce the Self-Verifying Agent, a new type of agent designed with dual missions: to not only complete a task but also to prove its accomplishment with curated snapshot evidences. Guided by our proposed 3C Principles (Completeness, Conciseness, and Creativity), the agent leverages its accessibility to the online environment to perform self-verification on a minimal, decisive set of snapshots. Such evidences are provided as the sole materials for a general LLM-as-a-Judge verifier to determine their validity and relevance. Experiments on mobile tasks across model families and scales demonstrate that our SmartSnap paradigm allows training LLM-driven agents in a scalable manner, bringing performance gains up to 26.08% and 16.66% respectively to 8B and 30B models. The synergizing between solution finding and evidence seeking facilitates the cultivation of efficient, self-verifying agents with competitive performance against DeepSeek V3.1 and Qwen3-235B-A22B.",

We introduce a high-level safety case sketch as a tool for understanding and comparing these monitoring protocols.

This paper presents an adaptive GPU resource allocation framework that achieves 85\\% latency reduction compared to round-robin scheduling while maintaining comparable throughput to static allocation, using an $O(N)$ complexity algorithm for real-time adaptation. Our approach dynamically allocates GPU resources based on workload characteristics, agent priorities, and minimum resource requirements, enabling efficient utilization while maintaining quality of service. The framework addresses three key challenges: (1) heterogeneous computational demands across lightweight coordinators and heavyweight specialists, (2) dynamic workload fluctuations requiring millisecond-scale reallocation, and (3) capacity constraints in serverless environments. Through comprehensive simulations modeling realistic multi-agent workflows with four heterogeneous agents, we demonstrate that adaptive allocation outperforms static equal and round-robin strategies across latency, cost, and GPU utilization metrics. The framework provides a practical solution for deploying cost-efficient multi-agent AI systems on serverless GPU infrastructure.",

        "summary": "As the internet evolves from the mobile App-dominated Attention Economy to the Intent-Interconnection of the Agentic Web era, existing interaction modes fail to address the escalating challenges of data lock-in and cognitive overload. Addressing this, we defines a future-oriented user sovereignty interaction paradigm, aiming to realize a fundamental shift from killing time to saving time. Specifically, we argue that decoupling memory from application logic eliminates the structural basis of data lock-in, while shifting from explicit manual instruction to implicit intent alignment resolves cognitive overload by offloading execution complexity. This paradigm is implemented via the Sovereign Digital Avatar (SoDA), which employs an orthogonal decoupling design of storage, computation, and interaction. This establishes the architectural principle of data as a persistent asset, model as a transient tool, fundamentally breaking the platform monopoly on user memory. To support the operation of this new paradigm in zero-trust environments, we design an Intent-Permission Handshake Mechanism based on A2A protocols, utilizing dual-factor (Sensitivity Coefficient and Strictness Parameter) adaptive routing to achieve active risk governance. Empirical evaluation with a high-fidelity simulation environment indicates that this paradigm reduces token consumption by approximately 27-35\\% during cross-platform service migration and complex task execution. Furthermore, in the orchestration of multi-modal complex tasks, it reduces user cognitive load by 72\\% compared to standard Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures, by 88\\% relative to manual workflows, while significantly boosting the Information Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR). These results demonstrate that the SoDA is the essential interaction infrastructure for building an efficient, low-friction, and decentralized Agentic Web.",

Recent work proposes novel techniques to find natural language prompts that induce specific behaviors from a target model, yet they are mainly studied in single-turn settings. In this work, we study behavior elicitation in the context of multi-turn conversations. We first offer an analytical framework that categorizes existing methods into three families based on their interactions with the target model: those that use only prior knowledge, those that use offline interactions, and those that learn from online interactions. We then introduce a generalized multi-turn formulation of the online method, unifying single-turn and multi-turn elicitation. We evaluate all three families of methods on automatically generating multi-turn test cases. We investigate the efficiency of these approaches by analyzing the trade-off between the query budget, i.e., the number of interactions with the target model, and the success rate, i.e., the discovery rate of behavior-eliciting inputs. We find that online methods can achieve an average success rate of 45/19/77% with just a few thousand queries over three tasks where static methods from existing multi-turn conversation benchmarks find few or even no failure cases. Our work highlights a novel application of behavior elicitation methods in multi-turn conversation evaluation and the need for the community to move towards dynamic benchmarks.",

We construct preference pairs for direct alignment from each adjacent step in the chain, enabling the model to learn from localized, targeted edits.

We present ProfASR-Bench, a professional-talk evaluation suite for high-stakes applications across finance, medicine, legal, and technology. Each example pairs a natural-language prompt (domain cue and/or speaker profile) with an entity-rich target utterance, enabling controlled measurement of context-conditioned recognition. The corpus supports conventional ASR metrics alongside entity-aware scores and slice-wise reporting by accent and gender. Using representative families Whisper (encoder-decoder ASR) and Qwen-Omni (audio language models) under matched no-context, profile, domain+profile, oracle, and adversarial conditions, we find a consistent pattern: lightweight textual context produces little to no change in average word error rate (WER), even with oracle prompts, and adversarial prompts do not reliably degrade performance. We term this the context-utilization gap (CUG): current systems are nominally promptable yet underuse readily available side information. ProfASR-Bench provides a standardized context ladder, entity- and slice-aware reporting with confidence intervals, and a reproducible testbed for comparing fusion strategies across model families.

However, a lack of a domain-expert annotated dataset for the consumer healthcare questions summarization task inhibits the development of an efficient summarization system. To address this issue, we introduce a new dataset, CHQ-Sum,m that contains 1507 domain-expert annotated consumer health questions and corresponding summaries. The dataset is derived from the community question answering forum and therefore provides a valuable resource for understanding consumer health-related posts on social media.

Experiments on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) demonstrate that InfTool transforms a base 32B model from 19.8% to 70.9% accuracy (+258%), surpassing models 10x larger and rivaling Claude-Opus, and entirely from synthetic data without human annotation.",

We evaluate three proprietary and two open-source SLMs, demonstrating that none of these models can maintain a consistent speaking style when instructed to do so. We further show that when SLMs are asked to recall the style instruction in later turns, they can recall the style instruction, but they fail to express it throughout the conversation. We also show that explicitly asking the model to recall the style instruction can partially mitigate style amnesia.

However, it has been observed that LVLMs, after tuning to visual instruction using commonly used training datasets, often fail to exhibit the instruction-following ability that was present in the LLM before integration, leading to results in which they do not follow task instructions as expected. This study quantitatively demonstrates that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning and analyzes its underlying causes. In particular, we constructed new training datasets highlighting whether the output format is specified. Then, we investigated how explicitly indicating the output format during fine-tuning affects LVLMs' instruction-following ability. Our quantitative evaluation confirmed that LVLMs' instruction-following ability declines after fine-tuning with commonly used datasets. Furthermore, we found that LVLMs trained with datasets, including instructions on output format, tend to follow instructions more accurately than models that do not. These findings suggest that including samples with instructions on output format during (visual) instruction tuning may help mitigate the decline in instruction-following abilities.",

We evaluate the proposed approach using two widely used LLMs, GPT-4o and Gemini-2.5-Flash, across two hallucination detection datasets. To support more reliable future benchmarking, one of these datasets has been manually curated and enhanced and is released as a secondary outcome of this work. Compared to standard self-detection methods and SelfCheckGPT, a state-of-the-art approach, our method achieves up to 16% relative improvement in accuracy and 20% in F1-score.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are highly vulnerable to input confirmation bias. When a prompt implies a preferred answer, models often reinforce that bias rather than explore alternatives. This phenomenon remains underexplored, yet it is already harmful in base models and poses an even greater risk in multi-agent debate, where echo chambers reinforce bias instead of correction. We introduce Mixture of Latent Concept Experts (MoLaCE), a lightweight inference-time framework that addresses confirmation bias by mixing experts instantiated as different activation strengths over latent concepts that shape model responses. Our key insight is that, due to the compositional nature of language, differently phrased prompts reweight latent concepts in prompt-specific ways that affect factual correctness, so no single fixed intervention can be applied universally across inputs. This design enables a single LLM to emulate the benefits of debate internally while remaining computationally efficient and scalable. It can also be integrated into multi-agent debate frameworks to diversify perspectives and reduce correlated errors. We empirically show that it consistently reduces confirmation bias, improves robustness, and matches or surpasses multi-agent debate while requiring only a fraction of the computation.",

        "summary": "This paper presents ACT (Allocate Connections between Texts), a novel three-stage algorithm for the automatic detection of biblical quotations in Rabbinic literature. Unlike existing text reuse frameworks that struggle with short, paraphrased, or structurally embedded quotations, ACT combines a morphology-aware alignment algorithm with a context-sensitive enrichment stage that identifies complex citation patterns such as \"Wave\" and \"Echo\" quotations. Our approach was evaluated against leading systems, including Dicta, Passim, Text-Matcher, as well as human-annotated critical editions. We further assessed three ACT configurations to isolate the contribution of each component. Results demonstrate that the full ACT pipeline (ACT-QE) outperforms all baselines, achieving an F1 score of 0.91, with superior Recall (0.89) and Precision (0.94). Notably, ACT-2, which lacks stylistic enrichment, achieves higher Recall (0.90) but suffers in Precision, while ACT-3, using longer n-grams, offers a tradeoff between coverage and specificity. In addition to improving quotation detection, ACT's ability to classify stylistic patterns across corpora opens new avenues for genre classification and intertextual analysis. This work contributes to digital humanities and computational philology by addressing the methodological gap between exhaustive machine-based detection and human editorial judgment. ACT lays a foundation for broader applications in historical textual analysis, especially in morphologically rich and citation-dense traditions like Aggadic literature.",

        "summary": "Semantic text classification has undergone significant advances in recent years due to the rise of large language models (LLMs) and their high dimensional embeddings. While LLM-embeddings are frequently used to store and retrieve text by semantic similarity in vector databases, the global structure semantic relationships in text corpora often remains opaque. Herein we propose a nested density clustering approach, to infer hierarchical trees of semantically related texts. The method starts by identifying texts of strong semantic similarity as it searches for dense clusters in LLM embedding space. As the density criterion is gradually relaxed, these dense clusters merge into more diffuse clusters, until the whole dataset is represented by a single cluster - the root of the tree. By embedding dense clusters into increasingly diffuse ones, we construct a tree structure that captures hierarchical semantic relationships among texts. We outline how this approach can be used to classify textual data for abstracts of scientific abstracts as a case study. This enables the data-driven discovery research areas and their subfields without predefined categories. To evaluate the general applicability of the method, we further apply it to established benchmark datasets such as the 20 News- groups and IMDB 50k Movie Reviews, demonstrating its robustness across domains. Finally we discuss possible applications on scientometrics, topic evolution, highlighting how nested density trees can reveal semantic structure and evolution in textual datasets.",

        "summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models lack explicit constraints to ensure the router's decisions align well with the experts' capabilities, which ultimately limits model performance. To address this, we propose expert-router coupling (ERC) loss, a lightweight auxiliary loss that tightly couples the router's decisions with expert capabilities. Our approach treats each expert's router embedding as a proxy token for the tokens assigned to that expert, and feeds perturbed router embeddings through the experts to obtain internal activations. The ERC loss enforces two constraints on these activations: (1) Each expert must exhibit higher activation for its own proxy token than for the proxy tokens of any other expert. (2) Each proxy token must elicit stronger activation from its corresponding expert than from any other expert. These constraints jointly ensure that each router embedding faithfully represents its corresponding expert's capability, while each expert specializes in processing the tokens actually routed to it. The ERC loss is computationally efficient, operating only on n^2 activations, where n is the number of experts. This represents a fixed cost independent of batch size, unlike prior coupling methods that scale with the number of tokens (often millions per batch). Through pre-training MoE-LLMs ranging from 3B to 15B parameters and extensive analysis on trillions of tokens, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the ERC loss. Moreover, the ERC loss offers flexible control and quantitative tracking of expert specialization levels during training, providing valuable insights into MoEs.",

This dynamic clinical-reasoning process is poorly represented by existing LLM benchmarks that focus on static question-answering. To mitigate these gaps, recent methods explore dynamic medical frameworks involving interactive clinical dialogues. Although effective, they often rely on limited, contamination-prone datasets and lack granular, multi-level evaluation. In this work, we propose ClinDEF, a dynamic framework for assessing clinical reasoning in LLMs through simulated diagnostic dialogues. Grounded in a disease knowledge graph, our method dynamically generates patient cases and facilitates multi-turn interactions between an LLM-based doctor and an automated patient agent. Our evaluation protocol goes beyond diagnostic accuracy by incorporating fine-grained efficiency analysis and rubric-based assessment of diagnostic quality. Experiments show that ClinDEF effectively exposes critical clinical reasoning gaps in state-of-the-art LLMs, offering a more nuanced and clinically meaningful evaluation paradigm.",

However, prior paradigms typically address these in isolation, often mitigating one at the expense of exacerbating the other. To address this, we conduct a systematic exploration of these reasoning failures and identify a primary inducement: the latent spurious feature correlations within the input that drive these erroneous reasoning shortcuts. Driven by these findings, we introduce Causal-Contrastive Preference Optimization (C2PO), a unified alignment framework designed to tackle these specific failures by simultaneously discovering and suppressing these correlations directly within the optimization process. Specifically, C2PO leverages causal counterfactual signals to isolate bias-inducing features from valid reasoning paths, and employs a fairness-sensitive preference update mechanism to dynamically evaluate logit-level contributions and suppress shortcut features. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks covering stereotypical bias (BBQ, Unqover), structural bias (MNLI, HANS, Chatbot, MT-Bench), out-of-domain fairness (StereoSet, WinoBias), and general utility (MMLU, GSM8K) demonstrate that C2PO effectively mitigates stereotypical and structural biases while preserving robust general reasoning capabilities.",

However, prior findings remain inconsistent, and most studies operationalize diversity in aggregate terms, overlooking internal role differentiation. This limitation obscures a more nuanced understanding of how gender diversity shapes team impact. In particular, the effect of gender diversity across different team roles remains poorly understood. To this end, we define a scientific team as all coauthors of a paper and measure team impact through five-year citation counts. Using author contribution statements, we classified members into leadership and support roles. Drawing on more than 130,000 papers from PLOS journals, most of which are in biomedical-related disciplines, we employed multivariable regression to examine the association between gender diversity in these roles and team impact. Furthermore, we apply a threshold regression model to investigate how team size moderates this relationship. The results show that (1) the relationship between gender diversity and team impact follows an inverted U-shape for both leadership and support groups; (2) teams with an all-female leadership group and an all-male support group achieve higher impact than other team types. Interestingly, (3) the effect of leadership-group gender diversity is significantly negative for small teams but becomes positive and statistically insignificant in large teams. In contrast, the estimates for support-group gender diversity remain significant and positive, regardless of team size.",

        "summary": "As access to high-quality, domain-specific data grows increasingly scarce, multi-epoch training has become a practical strategy for adapting large language models (LLMs). However, autoregressive models often suffer from performance degradation under repeated data exposure, where overfitting leads to a marked decline in model capability. Through empirical analysis, we trace this degradation to an imbalance in learning dynamics: predictable, low-entropy tokens are learned quickly and come to dominate optimization, while the model's ability to generalize on high-entropy tokens deteriorates with continued training. To address this, we introduce EntroDrop, an entropy-guided token dropout method that functions as structured data regularization. EntroDrop selectively masks low-entropy tokens during training and employs a curriculum schedule to adjust regularization strength in alignment with training progress. Experiments across model scales from 0.6B to 8B parameters show that EntroDrop consistently outperforms standard regularization baselines and maintains robust performance throughout extended multi-epoch training. These findings underscore the importance of aligning regularization with token-level learning dynamics when training on limited data. Our approach offers a promising pathway toward more effective adaptation of LLMs in data-constrained domains.",

In particular, models trained on large scale textual corpora may incorporate noisy or irrelevant information during generation, which can lead to incorrect predictions or outputs that are inconsistent with factual knowledge. To address this limitation, we propose a stepwise reasoning enhancement framework for LLMs based on external subgraph generation, termed SGR. The proposed framework dynamically constructs query relevant subgraphs from external knowledge bases and leverages their semantic structure to guide the reasoning process. By performing reasoning in a step by step manner over structured subgraphs, SGR reduces the influence of noisy information and improves reasoning accuracy. Specifically, the framework first generates an external subgraph tailored to the input query, then guides the model to conduct multi step reasoning grounded in the subgraph, and finally integrates multiple reasoning paths to produce the final answer. Experimental results on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that SGR consistently outperforms strong baselines, indicating its effectiveness in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.",

We hypothesize that this difficulty stems from polysemanticity--individual dimensions encoding multiple entangled concepts. To address this, we leverage pre-trained Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant features in a disentangled feature space, then construct an explicit, interpretable low-rank subspace to guide adapter initialization. We provide theoretical analysis proving that under monosemanticity assumptions, SAE-based subspace identification achieves arbitrarily small recovery error, while direct identification in polysemantic space suffers an irreducible error floor. On safety alignment, our method achieves up to 99.6% safety rate--exceeding full fine-tuning by 7.4 percentage points and approaching RLHF-based methods--while updating only 0.19-0.24% of parameters. Crucially, our method provides interpretable insights into the learned alignment subspace through the semantic grounding of SAE features.

Despite having zero prior training exposure to Anka, Claude 3.5 Haiku achieves 99.9% parse success and 95.8% overall task accuracy across 100 benchmark problems. Critically, Anka demonstrates a 40 percentage point accuracy advantage over Python on multi-step pipeline tasks (100% vs. 60%), where Python's flexible syntax leads to frequent errors in operation sequencing and variable management. Cross-model validation with GPT-4o-mini confirms this advantage (+26.7 percentage points on multi-step tasks). Our results demonstrate that: (1) LLMs can learn novel DSLs entirely from in-context prompts, achieving near-native accuracy; (2) constrained syntax significantly reduces errors on complex tasks; and (3) domain-specific languages purposefully designed for LLM generation can outperform general-purpose languages on which the LLM has extensive training.

        "summary": "High-quality scientific extreme summary (TLDR) facilitates effective science communication. How do large language models (LLMs) perform in generating them? How are LLM-generated summaries different from those written by human experts? However, the lack of a comprehensive, high-quality scientific TLDR dataset hinders both the development and evaluation of LLMs' summarization ability. To address these, we propose a novel dataset, BiomedTLDR, containing a large sample of researcher-authored summaries from scientific papers, which leverages the common practice of including authors' comments alongside bibliography items. We then test popular open-weight LLMs for generating TLDRs based on abstracts. Our analysis reveals that, although some of them successfully produce humanoid summaries, LLMs generally exhibit a greater affinity for the original text's lexical choices and rhetorical structures, hence tend to be more extractive rather than abstractive in general, compared to humans. Our code and datasets are available at https://github.com/netknowledge/LLM_summarization (Lyu and Ke, 2025).",

In this study, we target computational efficiency by focusing on a matrix multiplication free language model (MatMul-free LM) and further reducing the training cost through an architecture inspired by reservoir computing. Specifically, we partially fix and share the weights of selected layers in the MatMul-free LM and insert reservoir layers to obtain rich dynamic representations without additional training overhead. Additionally, several operations are combined to reduce memory accesses. Experimental results show that the proposed architecture reduces the number of parameters by up to 19%, training time by 9.9%, and inference time by 8.0%, while maintaining comparable performance to the baseline model.",

ModernBERT consolidates these advances by integrating Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE), FlashAttention, and refined normalization. Despite these developments, Turkish NLP lacks a monolingual encoder trained from scratch incorporating such modern architectural paradigms. This work introduces TabiBERT, a monolingual Turkish encoder based on ModernBERT architecture trained from scratch on a large, curated corpus. TabiBERT is pre-trained on one trillion tokens sampled from an 84.88B token multi-domain corpus: web text (73%), scientific publications (20%), source code (6%), and mathematical content (0.3%). The model supports 8,192-token context length (16x original BERT), achieves up to 2.65x inference speedup, and reduces GPU memory consumption, enabling larger batch sizes. We introduce TabiBench with 28 datasets across eight task categories with standardized splits and protocols, evaluated using GLUE-style macro-averaging. TabiBERT attains 77.58 on TabiBench, outperforming BERTurk by 1.62 points and establishing state-of-the-art on five of eight categories: question answering (+9.55), code retrieval (+2.41), and document retrieval (+0.60). Compared with task-specific prior best results, including specialized models like TurkishBERTweet, TabiBERT achieves +1.47 average improvement, indicating robust cross-domain generalization.

Prompt Choreography significantly reduces per-message latency (2.0--6.2$\\times$ faster time-to-first-token) and achieves substantial end-to-end speedups ($>$2.2$\\times$) in some workflows dominated by redundant computation.",

We argue this metric confuses unfaithfulness with incompleteness, the lossy compression needed to turn distributed transformer computation into a linear natural language narrative. On multi-hop reasoning tasks with Llama-3 and Gemma-3, many CoTs flagged as unfaithful by Biasing Features are judged faithful by other metrics, exceeding 50% in some models. With a new faithful@k metric, we show that larger inference-time token budgets greatly increase hint verbalization (up to 90% in some settings), suggesting much apparent unfaithfulness is due to tight token limits. Using Causal Mediation Analysis, we further show that even non-verbalized hints can causally mediate prediction changes through the CoT. We therefore caution against relying solely on hint-based evaluations and advocate a broader interpretability toolkit, including causal mediation and corruption-based metrics.",

Current LLMs cannot natively ingest long-duration sensor streams, and paired sensor-text datasets are scarce. To address these challenges, we introduce LENS, a framework that aligns multimodal sensing data with language models to generate clinically grounded mental-health narratives. LENS first constructs a large-scale dataset by transforming Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) responses related to depression and anxiety symptoms into natural-language descriptions, yielding over 100,000 sensor-text QA pairs from 258 participants. To enable native time-series integration, we train a patch-level encoder that projects raw sensor signals directly into an LLM's representation space. Our results show that LENS outperforms strong baselines on standard NLP metrics and task-specific measures of symptom-severity accuracy. A user study with 13 mental-health professionals further indicates that LENS-produced narratives are comprehensive and clinically meaningful. Ultimately, our approach advances LLMs as interfaces for health sensing, providing a scalable path toward models that can reason over raw behavioral signals and support downstream clinical decision-making.",

Post-training structured pruning offers an efficient solution. However, when few-shot calibration sets fail to adequately reflect the pretraining data distribution, existing methods exhibit limited generalization to downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose Function-Aware Neuron Grouping (FANG), a post-training pruning framework that alleviates calibration bias by identifying and preserving neurons critical to specific function. FANG groups neurons with similar function based on the type of semantic context they process and prunes each group independently. During importance estimation within each group, tokens that strongly correlate with the functional role of the neuron group are given higher weighting. Additionally, FANG also preserves neurons that contribute across multiple context types. To achieve a better trade-off between sparsity and performance, it allocates sparsity to each block adaptively based on its functional complexity. Experiments show that FANG improves downstream accuracy while preserving language modeling performance. It achieves the state-of-the-art (SOTA) results when combined with FLAP and OBC, two representative pruning methods. Specifically, FANG outperforms FLAP and OBC by 1.5%--8.5% in average accuracy under 30% and 40% sparsity.",

In this study, we evaluated the performance of three state-of-the-art LLMs-ChatGPT-4o, Gemini 1.5 Pro, and LIama 3.3 70B-in clinical decision support across the entire clinical reasoning workflow of a typical patient encounter. Using 36 case studies, we first assessed LLM's out-of-the-box performance across five key sequential clinical decision-making tasks under two temperature settings (default vs. zero): differential diagnosis, essential immediate steps, relevant diagnostic testing, final diagnosis, and treatment recommendation. All models showed high variability by task, achieving near-perfect accuracy in final diagnosis, poor performance in relevant diagnostic testing, and moderate performance in remaining tasks. Furthermore, ChatGPT performed better under the zero temperature, whereas LIama showed stronger performance under the default temperature. Next, we assessed whether prompt engineering could enhance LLM performance by applying variations of the MedPrompt framework, incorporating targeted and random dynamic few-shot learning. The results demonstrate that prompt engineering is not a one-size-fit-all solution. While it significantly improved the performance on the task with lowest baseline accuracy (relevant diagnostic testing), it was counterproductive for others. Another key finding was that the targeted dynamic few-shot prompting did not consistently outperform random selection, indicating that the presumed benefits of closely matched examples may be counterbalanced by loss of broader contextual diversity. These findings suggest that the impact of prompt engineering is highly model and task-dependent, highlighting the need for tailored, context-aware strategies for integrating LLMs into healthcare.",

The effectiveness of such RL training, however, depends critically on the exploration space defined by the pre-trained model's token-output distribution. In this paper, we revisit the standard cross-entropy loss, interpreting it as a specific instance of policy gradient optimization applied within a single-step episode. To systematically study how the pre-trained distribution shapes the exploration potential for subsequent RL, we propose a generalized pre-training objective that adapts on-policy RL principles to supervised learning. By framing next-token prediction as a stochastic decision process, we introduce a reward-shaping strategy that explicitly balances diversity and precision. Our method employs a positive reward scaling factor to control probability concentration on ground-truth tokens and a rank-aware mechanism that treats high-ranking and low-ranking negative tokens asymmetrically. This allows us to reshape the pre-trained token-output distribution and investigate how to provide a more favorable exploration space for RL, ultimately enhancing end-to-end reasoning performance. Contrary to the intuition that higher distribution entropy facilitates effective exploration, we find that imposing a precision-oriented prior yields a superior exploration space for RL.",

        "summary": "Autoregressive (AR) generation is the standard decoding paradigm for Large Language Models (LLMs), but its token-by-token nature limits parallelism at inference time. Diffusion Language Models (DLLMs) offer parallel decoding by recovering multiple masked tokens per step; however, in practice they often fail to translate this parallelism into deployment speed gains over optimized AR engines (e.g., vLLM). A key reason is that many DLLMs rely on bidirectional attention, which breaks standard prefix KV caching and forces repeated contextualization, undermining efficiency. We propose WeDLM, a diffusion decoding framework built entirely on standard causal attention to make parallel generation prefix-cache friendly. The core idea is to let each masked position condition on all currently observed tokens while keeping a strict causal mask, achieved by Topological Reordering that moves observed tokens to the physical prefix while preserving their logical positions. Building on this property, we introduce a streaming decoding procedure that continuously commits confident tokens into a growing left-to-right prefix and maintains a fixed parallel workload, avoiding the stop-and-wait behavior common in block diffusion methods. Experiments show that WeDLM preserves the quality of strong AR backbones while delivering substantial speedups, approaching 3x on challenging reasoning benchmarks and up to 10x in low-entropy generation regimes; critically, our comparisons are against AR baselines served by vLLM under matched deployment settings, demonstrating that diffusion-style decoding can outperform an optimized AR engine in practice.",

        "summary": "Infant mortality remains a significant public health concern in the United States, with birth defects identified as a leading cause. Despite ongoing efforts to understand the causes of negative pregnancy outcomes like miscarriage, stillbirths, birth defects, and premature birth, there is still a need for more comprehensive research and strategies for intervention. This paper introduces a novel approach that uses publicly available social media data, especially from platforms like Twitter, to enhance current datasets for studying negative pregnancy outcomes through observational research. The inherent challenges in utilizing social media data, including imbalance, noise, and lack of structure, necessitate robust preprocessing techniques and data augmentation strategies. By constructing a natural language processing (NLP) pipeline, we aim to automatically identify women sharing their pregnancy experiences, categorizing them based on reported outcomes. Women reporting full gestation and normal birth weight will be classified as positive cases, while those reporting negative pregnancy outcomes will be identified as negative cases. Furthermore, this study offers potential applications in assessing the causal impact of specific interventions, treatments, or prenatal exposures on maternal and fetal health outcomes. Additionally, it provides a framework for future health studies involving pregnant cohorts and comparator groups. In a broader context, our research showcases the viability of social media data as an adjunctive resource in epidemiological investigations about pregnancy outcomes.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to simulate population responses, a method known as ``Silicon Sampling''. However, responses to socially sensitive questions frequently exhibit Social Desirability Bias (SDB), diverging from real human data toward socially acceptable answers. Existing studies on social desirability bias in LLM-based sampling remain limited. In this work, we investigate whether minimal, psychologically grounded prompt wording can mitigate this bias and improve alignment between silicon and human samples. We conducted a study using data from the American National Election Study (ANES) on three LLMs from two model families: the open-source Llama-3.1 series and GPT-4.1-mini. We first replicate a baseline silicon sampling study, confirming the persistent Social Desirability Bias. We then test four prompt-based mitigation methods: \\emph{reformulated} (neutral, third-person phrasing), \\emph{reverse-coded} (semantic inversion), and two meta-instructions, \\emph{priming} and \\emph{preamble}, respectively encouraging analytics and sincerity. Alignment with ANES is evaluated using Jensen-Shannon Divergence with bootstrap confidence intervals. Our results demonstrate that reformulated prompts most effectively improve alignment by reducing distribution concentration on socially acceptable answers and achieving distributions closer to ANES. Reverse-coding produced mixed results across eligible items, while the Priming and Preamble encouraged response uniformity and showed no systematic benefit for bias mitigation. Our findings validate the efficacy of prompt-based framing controls in mitigating inherent Social Desirability Bias in LLMs, providing a practical path toward more representative silicon samples.",

We introduce a human-validated framework to evaluate whether model-generated reasoning traces logically support their conclusions across languages. Analyzing 65k reasoning traces from GlobalMMLU questions across 6 languages and 6 frontier models, we uncover a critical blind spot: while models achieve high task accuracy, their reasoning can fail to support their conclusions. Reasoning traces in non-Latin scripts show at least twice as much misalignment between their reasoning and conclusions than those in Latin scripts. We develop an error taxonomy through human annotation to characterize these failures, finding they stem primarily from evidential errors (unsupported claims, ambiguous facts) followed by illogical reasoning steps. Our findings demonstrate that current multilingual evaluation practices provide an incomplete picture of model reasoning capabilities and highlight the need for reasoning-aware evaluation frameworks.",

        "summary": "Hope speech has been relatively underrepresented in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current studies are largely focused on English, which has resulted in a lack of resources for low-resource languages such as Urdu. As a result, the creation of tools that facilitate positive online communication remains limited. Although transformer-based architectures have proven to be effective in detecting hate and offensive speech, little has been done to apply them to hope speech or, more generally, to test them across a variety of linguistic settings. This paper presents a multilingual framework for hope speech detection with a focus on Urdu. Using pretrained transformer models such as XLM-RoBERTa, mBERT, EuroBERT, and UrduBERT, we apply simple preprocessing and train classifiers for improved results. Evaluations on the PolyHope-M 2025 benchmark demonstrate strong performance, achieving F1-scores of 95.2% for Urdu binary classification and 65.2% for Urdu multi-class classification, with similarly competitive results in Spanish, German, and English. These results highlight the possibility of implementing existing multilingual models in low-resource environments, thus making it easier to identify hope speech and helping to build a more constructive digital discourse.",

We present a systematic study of Adaptive Prediction Sets (APS) applied to next-token prediction in transformer-based models with large vocabularies (greater than 250,000 tokens). Our central contribution is the identification of a coverage-efficiency tradeoff: while naive conformal prediction achieves valid coverage, it produces prediction sets of hundreds of tokens, rendering them uninformative. We propose Vocabulary-Aware Conformal Prediction (VACP), a framework that leverages semantic masking and temperature-adjusted scoring to reduce the effective prediction space while provably maintaining marginal coverage. Experiments on Gemma-2B using SQUAD and WikiText benchmarks demonstrate that VACP achieves 89.7 percent empirical coverage (90 percent target) while reducing the mean prediction set size from 847 tokens to 4.3 tokens -- a 197x improvement in efficiency. We provide a theoretical analysis of vocabulary reduction and release our implementation for reproducibility.",

        "summary": "Structured width pruning of GLU-MLP layers, guided by the Maximum Absolute Weight (MAW) criterion, reveals a systematic dichotomy in how reducing the expansion ratio affects different model capabilities. While performance on tasks relying on parametric knowledge (e.g., MMLU, GSM8K) and perplexity metrics degrades predictably, instruction-following capabilities improve substantially (+46% to +75% in IFEval for Llama-3.2-1B and 3B models), and multi-step reasoning remains robust (MUSR). This pattern challenges the prevailing assumption that pruning induces uniform degradation. We evaluated seven expansion ratio configurations using comprehensive benchmarks assessing factual knowledge, mathematical reasoning, language comprehension, instruction-following, and truthfulness. Our analysis identifies the expansion ratio as a critical architectural parameter that selectively modulates cognitive capabilities, rather than merely serving as a compression metric. We provide the first systematic characterization of this selective preservation phenomenon. Notably, we document a robust inverse correlation (r = -0.864, p = 0.012 in Llama-3B) between factual knowledge capacity (MMLU) and truthfulness metrics (TruthfulQA-MC2): as knowledge degrades, the model's ability to discriminate misconceptions improves consistently. This connects two previously distinct research areas, demonstrating that MAW-guided width pruning acts as a selective filter, reducing parametric knowledge while preserving or enhancing behavioral alignment. Additionally, we quantify context-dependent efficiency trade-offs: pruned configurations achieve up to 23% reduction in energy consumption (J/token) but incur penalties in single-request latency, whereas batch processing workloads benefit uniformly.",

        "summary": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a powerful technique for improving the problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly for tasks requiring multi-step reasoning. However, recent studies show that CoT explanations often fail to reflect the model's actual reasoning process, as models may produce coherent yet misleading justifications or modify answers without acknowledging external cues. Such discrepancies undermine the reliability of CoT-based methods for safety supervision and alignment monitoring, as models can generate plausible but deceptive rationales for incorrect answers. To better understand this limitation, we evaluate two optimization methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), in their ability to improve CoT faithfulness. Our experiments show that GRPO achieves higher performance than DPO in larger models, with the Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model attaining the best results across all evaluation metrics. Both approaches exhibit positive correlations between model size and performance, but GRPO shows greater potential for improving faithfulness metrics, albeit with less stable behavior at smaller scales. These results suggest that GRPO offers a promising direction for developing more transparent and trustworthy reasoning in LLMs.",

In this paper, we revisit diffusion language modeling from the view of diffusion process and language modeling, and outline five properties that separate diffusion mechanics from language-specific requirements. We first categorize existing approaches into continuous diffusion in embedding space and discrete diffusion over tokens. We then show that each satisfies only part of the five essential properties and therefore reflects a structural trade-off. Through analyses of recent large diffusion language models, we identify two central issues: (i) uniform corruption does not respect how information is distributed across positions, and (ii) token-wise marginal training cannot capture multi-token dependencies during parallel decoding. These observations motivate diffusion processes that align more closely with the structure of text, and encourage future work toward more coherent diffusion language models.",

Spanning 18 programming languages, M2G-Eval includes 17K+ training tasks and 1,286 human-annotated, contamination-controlled test instances.

Evaluating 30 models (28 state-of-the-art LLMs plus our two M2G-Eval-Coder variants) reveals three main findings: (1) an apparent difficulty hierarchy, with Line-level tasks easiest and Class-level most challenging; (2) widening performance gaps between full- and partial-granularity languages as task complexity increases; and (3) strong cross-language correlations, suggesting that models learn transferable programming concepts.

However, existing LLM-based approaches largely adopt general natural language processing techniques and are prone to reasoning errors when handling complex numerical sequences. Different from purely textual tasks, time series data are inherently verifiable, enabling consistency checking between reasoning steps and the original input. Motivated by this property, we propose T3LLM, which performs multi-step reasoning with an explicit correction mechanism for time series question answering. The T3LLM framework consists of three LLMs, namely, a worker, a reviewer, and a student, that are responsible for generation, review, and reasoning learning, respectively. Within this framework, the worker generates step-wise chains of thought (CoT) under structured prompts, while the reviewer inspects the reasoning, identifies erroneous steps, and provides corrective comments. The collaboratively generated corrected CoT are used to fine-tune the student model, internalizing multi-step reasoning and self-correction into its parameters. Experiments on multiple real-world TSQA benchmarks demonstrate that T3LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance over strong LLM-based baselines.",

Our results indicate that with a window size of 256 tokens, up to 93\\% of the original full attention operations can be replaced by sliding window attention without performance loss. Furthermore, by evaluating AHA across various window sizes, we identify a long-tail distribution in context dependency, where the necessity for full attention decays rapidly as the local window expands. By decoupling local processing from global access, AHA reveals that full attention is largely redundant, and that efficient inference requires only on-demand access to the global context.",

A comparative analysis shows that, under explicit normalization assumptions, the Sejong and Penn Korean treebanks can be treated as representationally equivalent at the eojeol based constituency level.

To effectively integrate LLMs into the accounting domain, it is essential to understand their domain-specific reasoning capabilities. This study introduces the concept of vertical-domain accounting reasoning and establishes evaluation criteria by analyzing the training data characteristics of representative GLM-series models. These criteria provide a foundation for subsequent research on reasoning paradigms and offer benchmarks for improving accounting reasoning performance. Based on this framework, we evaluate several representative models, including GLM-6B, GLM-130B, GLM-4, and OpenAI GPT-4, on a set of accounting reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that different prompt engineering strategies lead to varying degrees of performance improvement across models, with GPT-4 achieving the strongest accounting reasoning capability. However, current LLMs still fall short of real-world application requirements. In particular, further optimization is needed for deployment in enterprise-level accounting scenarios to fully realize the potential value of LLMs in this domain.",

        "summary": "Hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) pose a significant challenge, generating misleading or unverifiable content that undermines trust and reliability. Existing evaluation methods, such as KnowHalu, employ multi-stage verification but suffer from high computational costs. To address this, we integrate the Hughes Hallucination Evaluation Model (HHEM), a lightweight classification-based framework that operates independently of LLM-based judgments, significantly improving efficiency while maintaining high detection accuracy. We conduct a comparative analysis of hallucination detection methods across various LLMs, evaluating True Positive Rate (TPR), True Negative Rate (TNR), and Accuracy on question-answering (QA) and summarization tasks. Our results show that HHEM reduces evaluation time from 8 hours to 10 minutes, while HHEM with non-fabrication checking achieves the highest accuracy \\(82.2\\%\\) and TPR \\(78.9\\%\\). However, HHEM struggles with localized hallucinations in summarization tasks. To address this, we introduce segment-based retrieval, improving detection by verifying smaller text components. Additionally, our cumulative distribution function (CDF) analysis indicates that larger models (7B-9B parameters) generally exhibit fewer hallucinations, while intermediate-sized models show higher instability. These findings highlight the need for structured evaluation frameworks that balance computational efficiency with robust factual validation, enhancing the reliability of LLM-generated content.",

Our method incorporates semantic reasoning via an LLM-generated knowledge prior that captures feature importance, inter-class confusability, and exemplar budget multipliers, and uses it to guide exemplar scoring and selection. These priors are combined with margin-based validation cues, PageRank centrality, hubness penalization, and facility-location optimization to obtain a compact and informative set of exemplars. Evaluated on the UCI-HAR dataset under strict few-shot conditions, the framework achieves a macro F1-score of 88.78%, outperforming classical approaches such as random sampling, herding, and $k$-center. The results show that LLM-derived semantic priors, when integrated with structural and geometric cues, provide a stronger foundation for selecting representative sensor exemplars in few-shot wearable-sensor HAR.",

This design allows the model to selectively emphasize informative frequency bands during adaptation while preserving the representational capacity of the frozen backbone.

By applying core minimalist operations, viz., Merge, Move, Agree, and Spell-out, the study provides a layered syntactic analysis of qulk-clauses, for illustrating how their derivation proceeds through standard computational steps and post-syntactic processes such as Morphological Merger. The proposal also accounts for dialect-specific features like bipartite negation, cliticization, and CP embedding.

In this work, we investigate whether sentence embeddings encode a graded, hierarchical structure aligned with human-interpretable cognitive or psychological attributes. We construct a dataset of 480 natural-language sentences annotated with continuous ordinal energy scores and discrete tier labels spanning seven ordered cognitive categories. Using fixed sentence embeddings from multiple transformer models, we evaluate the recoverability of these annotations via linear and shallow nonlinear probes. Across models, both continuous scores and tier labels are reliably decodable, with shallow nonlinear probes providing consistent performance gains over linear probes. Lexical TF-IDF baselines perform substantially worse, indicating that the observed structure is not attributable to surface word statistics alone. Nonparametric permutation tests further confirm that probe performance exceeds chance under label-randomization nulls. Qualitative analyses using UMAP visualizations and confusion matrices reveal smooth low-to-high gradients and predominantly adjacent-tier confusions in embedding space. Taken together, these results provide evidence that transformer embedding spaces exhibit a hierarchical geometric organization aligned with human-defined cognitive attributes, while remaining agnostic to claims of internal awareness or phenomenology.",

        "summary": "AI co-scientists are emerging as a tool to assist human researchers in achieving their research goals. A crucial feature of these AI co-scientists is the ability to generate a research plan given a set of aims and constraints. The plan may be used by researchers for brainstorming, or may even be implemented after further refinement. However, language models currently struggle to generate research plans that follow all constraints and implicit requirements. In this work, we study how to leverage the vast corpus of existing research papers to train language models that generate better research plans. We build a scalable, diverse training corpus by automatically extracting research goals and goal-specific grading rubrics from papers across several domains. We then train models for research plan generation via reinforcement learning with self-grading. A frozen copy of the initial policy acts as the grader during training, with the rubrics creating a generator-verifier gap that enables improvements without external human supervision. To validate this approach, we conduct a study with human experts for machine learning research goals, spanning 225 hours. The experts prefer plans generated by our finetuned Qwen3-30B-A3B model over the initial model for 70% of research goals, and approve 84% of the automatically extracted goal-specific grading rubrics. To assess generality, we also extend our approach to research goals from medical papers, and new arXiv preprints, evaluating with a jury of frontier models. Our finetuning yields 12-22% relative improvements and significant cross-domain generalization, proving effective even in problem settings like medical research where execution feedback is infeasible. Together, these findings demonstrate the potential of a scalable, automated training recipe as a step towards improving general AI co-scientists.",

Existing approaches sit at two extremes: conventional web frameworks provide reliable but fixed contexts backed by databases, while fully generative world models aim for unlimited environments at the expense of controllability and practical engineering. In this work, we introduce the Web World Model (WWM), a middle ground where world state and ``physics'' are implemented in ordinary web code to ensure logical consistency, while large language models generate context, narratives, and high-level decisions on top of this structured latent state. We build a suite of WWMs on a realistic web stack, including an infinite travel atlas grounded in real geography, fictional galaxy explorers, web-scale encyclopedic and narrative worlds, and simulation- and game-like environments. Across these systems, we identify practical design principles for WWMs: separating code-defined rules from model-driven imagination, representing latent state as typed web interfaces, and utilizing deterministic generation to achieve unlimited but structured exploration. Our results suggest that web stacks themselves can serve as a scalable substrate for world models, enabling controllable yet open-ended environments.

Understanding public attitudes toward marriage requires examining not only emotional sentiment but also the moral reasoning underlying these evaluations. This study analyzed 219,358 marriage-related posts from two major Chinese social media platforms (Sina Weibo and Xiaohongshu) using large language model (LLM)-assisted content analysis. Drawing on Shweder's Big Three moral ethics framework, posts were coded for sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) and moral dimensions (Autonomy, Community, Divinity). Results revealed platform differences: Weibo discourse skewed positive, while Xiaohongshu was predominantly neutral. Most posts across both platforms lacked explicit moral framing. However, when moral ethics were invoked, significant associations with sentiment emerged. Posts invoking Autonomy ethics and Community ethics were predominantly negative, whereas Divinity-framed posts tended toward neutral or positive sentiment. These findings suggest that concerns about both personal autonomy constraints and communal obligations drive negative marriage attitudes in contemporary China. The study demonstrates LLMs' utility for scaling qualitative analysis and offers insights for developing culturally informed policies addressing marriage decline in Chinese contexts.",

On this benchmark, we evaluate 10 routing methods and baselines and observe a significant routability gain, while the best current routers still show a clear gap to the ideal Oracle, indicating considerable room for improvement in router architecture through finer visual cues and modeling of textual structure. We will open-source the complete data construction and evaluation toolchain to promote comparability, reproducibility, and practical deployment in multimodal routing research.",

In this work, we propose Hindsight instruction Replay (HiR), a novel sample-efficient RL framework for complex instruction following tasks, which employs a select-then-rewrite strategy to replay failed attempts as successes based on the constraints that have been satisfied in hindsight. We perform RL on these replayed samples as well as the original ones, theoretically framing the objective as dual-preference learning at both the instruction- and response-level to enable efficient optimization using only a binary reward signal.

This limitation effectively overlooks \"Familial models, a transformative paradigm essential for realizing ubiquitous intelligence across heterogeneous device-edge-cloud hierarchies. Transcending static architectures, familial models integrate early exits with relay-style inference to spawn G deployable sub-models from a single shared backbone. In this work, we theoretically and empirically extend the scaling law to capture this \"one-run, many-models\" paradigm by introducing Granularity (G) as a fundamental scaling variable alongside model size (N) and training tokens (D). To rigorously quantify this relationship, we propose a unified functional form L(N, D, G) and parameterize it using large-scale empirical runs. Specifically, we employ a rigorous IsoFLOP experimental design to strictly isolate architectural impact from computational scale. Across fixed budgets, we systematically sweep model sizes (N) and granularities (G) while dynamically adjusting tokens (D). This approach effectively decouples the marginal cost of granularity from the benefits of scale, ensuring high-fidelity parameterization of our unified scaling law. Our results reveal that the granularity penalty follows a multiplicative power law with an extremely small exponent. Theoretically, this bridges fixed-compute training with dynamic architectures. Practically, it validates the \"train once, deploy many\" paradigm, demonstrating that deployment flexibility is achievable without compromising the compute-optimality of dense baselines.",

To address this limitation, we introduce RW-Post, a high-quality and explainable dataset for real-world multimodal fact-checking. RW-Post aligns real-world multimodal claims with their original social media posts, preserving the rich contextual information in which the claims are made. In addition, the dataset includes detailed reasoning and explicitly linked evidence, which are derived from human written fact-checking articles via a large language model assisted extraction pipeline, enabling comprehensive verification and explanation. Building upon RW-Post, we propose AgentFact, an agent-based multimodal fact-checking framework designed to emulate the human verification workflow. AgentFact consists of five specialized agents that collaboratively handle key fact-checking subtasks, including strategy planning, high-quality evidence retrieval, visual analysis, reasoning, and explanation generation. These agents are orchestrated through an iterative workflow that alternates between evidence searching and task-aware evidence filtering and reasoning, facilitating strategic decision-making and systematic evidence analysis.

        "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents can increasingly automate complex reasoning through Test-Time Scaling (TTS), iterative refinement guided by reward signals. However, many real-world tasks involve multi-stage pipeline whose final outcomes lack verifiable rewards or sufficient data to train robust reward models, making judge-based refinement prone to accumulate error over stages. We propose Selective TTS, a process-based refinement framework that scales inference across different stages in multi-agent pipeline, instead of repeated refinement over time by prior work. By distributing compute across stages and pruning low-quality branches early using process-specific judges, Selective TTS mitigates the judge drift and stabilizes refinement. Grounded in the data science pipeline, we build an end-to-end multi-agent pipeline for generating visually insightful charts and report of given dataset, and design a reliable LLM-based judge model, aligned with human experts (Kendall's τ=0.55). Our proposed selective TTS then improves insight quality under a fixed compute budget, increasing mean scores from 61.64 to 65.86 while reducing variance. We hope our findings serve as the first step toward to scaling complex, open-ended tasks with unverifiable rewards, such as scientific discovery and story generation.",

In this work, we investigate the potential of constructing Vision-Language Models upon diffusion-based large language models (dLLMs) to overcome these limitations. We introduce Dream-VL, an open diffusion-based VLM (dVLM) that achieves state-of-the-art performance among previous dVLMs. Dream-VL is comparable to top-tier AR-based VLMs trained on open data on various benchmarks but exhibits superior potential when applied to visual planning tasks. Building upon Dream-VL, we introduce Dream-VLA, a dLLM-based Vision-Language-Action model (dVLA) developed through continuous pre-training on open robotic datasets. We demonstrate that the natively bidirectional nature of this diffusion backbone serves as a superior foundation for VLA tasks, inherently suited for action chunking and parallel generation, leading to significantly faster convergence in downstream fine-tuning. Dream-VLA achieves top-tier performance of 97.2% average success rate on LIBERO, 71.4% overall average on SimplerEnv-Bridge, and 60.5% overall average on SimplerEnv-Fractal, surpassing leading models such as $π_0$ and GR00T-N1. We also validate that dVLMs surpass AR baselines on downstream tasks across different training objectives. We release both Dream-VL and Dream-VLA to facilitate further research in the community.",

This means there is a gap between the expressive power of linear training and non-linear training. To bridge this gap, we propose AFA-LoRA, a novel training strategy that brings non-linear expressivity to LoRA while maintaining its seamless mergeability. Our key innovation is an annealed activation function that transitions from a non-linear to a linear transformation during training, allowing the adapter to initially adopt stronger representational capabilities before converging to a mergeable linear form. We implement our method on supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and speculative decoding. The results show that AFA-LoRA reduces the performance gap between LoRA and full-parameter training. This work enables a more powerful and practical paradigm of parameter-efficient adaptation.",

        "summary": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has catalyzed a shift towards autonomous agents capable of complex reasoning and tool use. However, current agent architectures are frequently constructed using imperative, ad hoc patterns. This results in brittle systems plagued by difficulties in state management, error handling, and concurrency. This paper introduces Monadic Context Engineering (MCE), a novel architectural paradigm leveraging the algebraic structures of Functors, Applicative Functors, and Monads to provide a formal foundation for agent design. MCE treats agent workflows as computational contexts where cross-cutting concerns, such as state propagation, short-circuiting error handling, and asynchronous execution, are managed intrinsically by the algebraic properties of the abstraction. We demonstrate how Monads enable robust sequential composition, how Applicatives provide a principled structure for parallel execution, and crucially, how Monad Transformers allow for the systematic composition of these capabilities. This layered approach enables developers to construct complex, resilient, and efficient AI agents from simple, independently verifiable components. We further extend this framework to describe Meta-Agents, which leverage MCE for generative orchestration, dynamically creating and managing sub-agent workflows through metaprogramming.

        "summary": "Symbolic world models (e.g., PDDL domains or executable simulators) are central to model-based planning, but training LLMs to generate such world models is limited by the lack of large-scale verifiable supervision. Current approaches rely primarily on static validation methods that fail to catch behavior-level errors arising from interactive execution. In this paper, we propose Agent2World, a tool-augmented multi-agent framework that achieves strong inference-time world-model generation and also serves as a data engine for supervised fine-tuning, by grounding generation in multi-agent feedback. Agent2World follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) A Deep Researcher agent performs knowledge synthesis by web searching to address specification gaps; (ii) A Model Developer agent implements executable world models; And (iii) a specialized Testing Team conducts adaptive unit testing and simulation-based validation. Agent2World demonstrates superior inference-time performance across three benchmarks spanning both Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) and executable code representations, achieving consistent state-of-the-art results. Beyond inference, Testing Team serves as an interactive environment for the Model Developer, providing behavior-aware adaptive feedback that yields multi-turn training trajectories. The model fine-tuned on these trajectories substantially improves world-model generation, yielding an average relative gain of 30.95% over the same model before training.

In experiments reported here, models exposed to such warnings reproduced the flagged content at rates statistically indistinguishable from models given the content directly (76.7% vs. 83.3%). Why? Sparse autoencoder analysis points to a failure of orthogonalization: \"describing X\" and \"performing X\" activate overlapping latent features. Feature #8684, which tracks code execution patterns, fires at comparable magnitude in both warning and exploitation contexts. A related phenomenon, what I call \"stealth slip\", allows conversational preambles to rotate activations into subspaces that linear probes miss entirely. Prompting and inference-time steering do not fix this; training-time feature ablation does. The upshot is that statistical co-occurrence dominates over pragmatic interpretation in current architectures. Models learn what tends to follow a context, not why it appeared there.",

Existing static strategies, such as sparse sampling, frame compression, and clustering, are optimized for offline settings and often produce fragmented or over-compressed outputs when applied to continuous video streams. We present VideoScaffold, a dynamic representation framework designed for streaming video understanding. It adaptively adjusts event granularity according to video duration while preserving fine-grained visual semantics. VideoScaffold introduces two key components: Elastic-Scale Event Segmentation (EES), which performs prediction-guided segmentation to dynamically refine event boundaries, and Hierarchical Event Consolidation (HEC), which progressively aggregates semantically related segments into multi-level abstractions. Working in concert, EES and HEC enable VideoScaffold to transition smoothly from fine-grained frame understanding to abstract event reasoning as the video stream unfolds. Extensive experiments across both offline and streaming video understanding benchmarks demonstrate that VideoScaffold achieves state-of-the-art performance. The framework is modular and plug-and-play, seamlessly extending existing image-based MLLMs to continuous video comprehension. The code is available at https://github.com/zheng980629/VideoScaffold.",

        "summary": "Attention sinks are tokens, often the beginning-of-sequence (BOS) token, that receive disproportionately high attention despite limited semantic relevance. In this work, we identify a class of attention sinks, which we term secondary sinks, that differ fundamentally from the sinks studied in prior works, which we term primary sinks. While prior works have identified that tokens other than BOS can sometimes become sinks, they were found to exhibit properties analogous to the BOS token. Specifically, they emerge at the same layer, persist throughout the network and draw a large amount of attention mass. Whereas, we find the existence of secondary sinks that arise primarily in middle layers and can persist for a variable number of layers, and draw a smaller, but still significant, amount of attention mass. Through extensive experiments across 11 model families, we analyze where these secondary sinks appear, their properties, how they are formed, and their impact on the attention mechanism. Specifically, we show that: (1) these sinks are formed by specific middle-layer MLP modules; these MLPs map token representations to vectors that align with the direction of the primary sink of that layer. (2) The $\\ell_2$-norm of these vectors determines the sink score of the secondary sink, and also the number of layers it lasts for, thereby leading to different impacts on the attention mechanisms accordingly. (3) The primary sink weakens in middle layers, coinciding with the emergence of secondary sinks. We observe that in larger-scale models, the location and lifetime of the sinks, together referred to as sink levels, appear in a more deterministic and frequent manner. Specifically, we identify three sink levels in QwQ-32B and six levels in Qwen3-14B.",

The model achieves an accuracy of 96%, with precision and recall scores exceeding 0.95 for both classes. This study also compares the custom CNN with established deep learning architectures, including ResNet50, VGG16, MobileNetV2, and DenseNet121.

A frozen VLM sensor is restricted to short, objective perception queries, while a text-only LLM reasoner decomposes each question, plans queries, and aggregates visual facts in natural language. This controlled interface defines a reward-aligned environment for training unbiased visual reasoning with reinforcement learning. Instantiated with Qwen2.5-VL and Llama3.2-Vision sensors, and trained with GRPO from only 641 curated multi-step questions, VISTA significantly improves robustness to real-world spurious correlations on SpuriVerse (+16.29% with Qwen-2.5-VL-7B and +6.77% with Llama-3.2-Vision-11B), while remaining competitive on MMVP and a balanced SeedBench subset. VISTA transfers robustly across unseen VLM sensors and is able to recognize and recover from VLM perception failures. Human analysis further shows that VISTA's reasoning traces are more neutral, less reliant on spurious attributes, and more explicitly grounded in visual evidence than end-to-end VLM baselines.",

Under this formulation, we only use a standard architecture -- a Transformer with sliding-window attention. However, our model continues learning at test time via next-token prediction on the given context, compressing the context it reads into its weights. In addition, we improve the model's initialization for learning at test time via meta-learning at training time. Overall, our method, a form of Test-Time Training (TTT), is End-to-End (E2E) both at test time (via next-token prediction) and training time (via meta-learning), in contrast to previous forms. We conduct extensive experiments with a focus on scaling properties. In particular, for 3B models trained with 164B tokens, our method (TTT-E2E) scales with context length in the same way as Transformer with full attention, while others, such as Mamba 2 and Gated DeltaNet, do not. However, similar to RNNs, TTT-E2E has constant inference latency regardless of context length, making it 2.7 times faster than full attention for 128K context. Our code is publicly available.",

In this approach, large randomly parameterized CDEs act as continuous-time reservoirs, mapping input paths to rich representations.

Building on this foundation, we propose two variants: (i) Random Fourier CDEs (RF-CDEs): these lift the input signal using random Fourier features prior to the dynamics, providing a kernel-free approximation of RBF-enhanced sequence models; (ii) Random Rough DEs (R-RDEs): these operate directly on rough-path inputs via a log-ODE discretization, using log-signatures to capture higher-order temporal interactions while remaining stable and efficient. We prove that in the infinite-width limit, these model induces the RBF-lifted signature kernel and the rough signature kernel, respectively, offering a unified perspective on random-feature reservoirs, continuous-time deep architectures, and path-signature theory. We evaluate both models across a range of time-series benchmarks, demonstrating competitive or state-of-the-art performance.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning and coding capabilities, yet they struggle to generalize to real-world software engineering (SWE) problems that are long-horizon and out of distribution. Existing systems often rely on a single agent to handle the entire workflow-interpreting issues, navigating large codebases, and implementing fixes-within one reasoning chain. Such monolithic designs force the model to retain irrelevant context, leading to spurious correlations and poor generalization. Motivated by how human engineers decompose complex problems, we propose structuring SWE agents as orchestrators coordinating specialized sub-agents for sub-tasks such as localization, editing, and validation. The challenge lies in discovering effective hierarchies automatically: as the number of sub-agents grows, the search space becomes combinatorial, and it is difficult to attribute credit to individual sub-agents within a team. We address these challenges by formulating hierarchy discovery as a multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem, where each arm represents a candidate sub-agent and the reward measures its helpfulness when collaborating with others. This framework, termed Bandit Optimization for Agent Design (BOAD), enables efficient exploration of sub-agent designs under limited evaluation budgets. On SWE-bench-Verified, BOAD outperforms single-agent and manually designed multi-agent systems. On SWE-bench-Live, featuring more recent and out-of-distribution issues, our 36B system ranks second on the leaderboard at the time of evaluation, surpassing larger models such as GPT-4 and Claude. These results demonstrate that automatically discovered hierarchical multi-agent systems significantly improve generalization on challenging long-horizon SWE tasks.

The dominant paradigm--Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA)--enforces feature invariance, aligning source and target representations via symmetric divergence minimization [Ganin et al., 2016]. We demonstrate that this approach is fundamentally flawed: when domains are unequally informative (e.g., high-quality vs degraded sensors), strict invariance necessitates information destruction, causing \"negative transfer\" that can be catastrophic in safety-critical applications [Wang et al., 2019]. We propose a decision-theoretic framework grounded in Le Cam's theory of statistical experiments [Le Cam, 1986], using constructive approximations to replace symmetric invariance with directional simulability. We introduce Le Cam Distortion, quantified by the Deficiency Distance $δ(E_1, E_2)$, as a rigorous upper bound for transfer risk conditional on simulability. Our framework enables transfer without source degradation by learning a kernel that simulates the target from the source. Across five experiments (genomics, vision, reinforcement learning), Le Cam Distortion achieves: (1) near-perfect frequency estimation in HLA genomics (correlation $r=0.999$, matching classical methods), (2) zero source utility loss in CIFAR-10 image classification (81.2% accuracy preserved vs 34.7% drop for CycleGAN), and (3) safe policy transfer in RL control where invariance-based methods suffer catastrophic collapse. Le Cam Distortion provides the first principled framework for risk-controlled transfer learning in domains where negative transfer is unacceptable: medical imaging, autonomous systems, and precision medicine.",

To address this issue, we propose EGDA, a framework that reduces cross-session discrepancies by jointly aligning the global (marginal) and class-specific (conditional) distributions, while preserving the intrinsic structure of EEG data through graph regularization. Experimental results on the SEED-IV dataset demonstrate that EGDA achieves robust cross-session performance, obtaining accuracies of 81.22%, 80.15%, and 83.27% across three transfer tasks, and surpassing several baseline methods. Furthermore, the analysis highlights the Gamma frequency band as the most discriminative and identifies the central-parietal and prefrontal brain regions as critical for reliable emotion recognition.",

Furthermore, the scaling law has enabled AI to initially develop general intelligence, as demonstrated by Large Language Models (LLMs). To this stage, AI has had an enormous influence on society and yet still keeps shaping the future for humanity. However, distribution shift remains a persistent ``Achilles' heel'', fundamentally limiting the reliability and general usefulness of ML systems. Moreover, generalization under distribution shift would also cause trust issues for AIs. Motivated by these challenges, my research focuses on \\textit{Trustworthy Machine Learning under Distribution Shifts}, with the goal of expanding AI's robustness, versatility, as well as its responsibility and reliability. We carefully study the three common distribution shifts into: (1) Perturbation Shift, (2) Domain Shift, and (3) Modality Shift. For all scenarios, we also rigorously investigate trustworthiness via three aspects: (1) Robustness, (2) Explainability, and (3) Adaptability. Based on these dimensions, we propose effective solutions and fundamental insights, meanwhile aiming to enhance the critical ML problems, such as efficiency, adaptability, and safety.",

To address such an issue, we proposed a BO based training mechanism for the convergence speed improvement, which provides a more reliable learning direction and sample selection method to track the imbalance sample problem.

Widely used capability leaderboards do not translate directly into deployment decisions, creating a capability--deployment gap; to bridge it, we take a systems-level view in which model choice is tied to application outcomes, operating constraints, and a capability--cost frontier. We develop ML Compass, a framework that treats model selection as constrained optimization over this frontier. On the theory side, we characterize optimal model configurations under a parametric frontier and show a three-regime structure in optimal internal measures: some dimensions are pinned at compliance minima, some saturate at maximum levels, and the remainder take interior values governed by frontier curvature. We derive comparative statics that quantify how budget changes, regulatory tightening, and technological progress propagate across capability dimensions and costs. On the implementation side, we propose a pipeline that (i) extracts low-dimensional internal measures from heterogeneous model descriptors, (ii) estimates an empirical frontier from capability and cost data, (iii) learns a user- or task-specific utility function from interaction outcome data, and (iv) uses these components to target capability--cost profiles and recommend models. We validate ML Compass with two case studies: a general-purpose conversational setting using the PRISM Alignment dataset and a healthcare setting using a custom dataset we build using HealthBench. In both environments, our framework produces recommendations -- and deployment-aware leaderboards based on predicted deployment value under constraints -- that can differ materially from capability-only rankings, and clarifies how trade-offs between capability, cost, and safety shape optimal model choice.",

This trade-off hampers the ability of PEFT methods to capture complex patterns needed for diverse tasks. To address these challenges, we propose FRoD, a novel fine-tuning method that combines hierarchical joint decomposition with rotational degrees of freedom. By extracting a globally shared basis across layers and injecting sparse, learnable perturbations into scaling factors for flexible full-rank updates, FRoD enhances expressiveness and efficiency, leading to faster and more robust convergence.

However, RM training data is commonly recognized as low-quality, containing inductive biases that can easily lead to overfitting and reward hacking. For example, more detailed and comprehensive responses are usually human-preferred but with more words, leading response length to become one of the inevitable inductive biases. A limited number of prior RM debiasing approaches either target a single specific type of bias or model the problem with only simple linear correlations, \\textit{e.g.}, Pearson coefficients. To mitigate more complex and diverse inductive biases in reward modeling, we introduce a novel information-theoretic debiasing method called \\textbf{D}ebiasing via \\textbf{I}nformation optimization for \\textbf{R}M (DIR). Inspired by the information bottleneck (IB), we maximize the mutual information (MI) between RM scores and human preference pairs, while minimizing the MI between RM outputs and biased attributes of preference inputs. With theoretical justification from information theory, DIR can handle more sophisticated types of biases with non-linear correlations, broadly extending the real-world application scenarios for RM debiasing methods. In experiments, we verify the effectiveness of DIR with three types of inductive biases: \\textit{response length}, \\textit{sycophancy}, and \\textit{format}. We discover that DIR not only effectively mitigates target inductive biases but also enhances RLHF performance across diverse benchmarks, yielding better generalization abilities.

Unlike deterministic Siamese approaches, which compare scans from different time points but fail to account for the inherent uncertainty in disease evolution, STAMP learns temporal dynamics stochastically by reframing the MAE reconstruction loss as a conditional variational inference objective. We evaluated STAMP on two OCT and one MRI datasets with multiple visits per patient. STAMP pretrained ViT models outperformed both existing temporal MAE methods and foundation models on different late stage Age-Related Macular Degeneration and Alzheimer's Disease progression prediction which require models to learn the underlying non-deterministic temporal dynamics of the diseases.",

By decoupling the solution geometry from the ambient search space, we empirically demonstrate across ResNet-50, ViT, and BERT that the classification head can be compressed by even huge factors of 16 with negligible performance degradation.

Recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed to address blind inverse problems, demonstrating strong empirical performance and adaptability. However, these methods often lack interpretability and are not supported by rigorous theoretical guarantees, limiting their reliability in applied domains such as imaging inverse problems. In this work, we shed light on learning in blind inverse problems within the simplified yet insightful framework of Linear Minimum Mean Square Estimators (LMMSEs). We provide an in-depth theoretical analysis, deriving closed-form expressions for optimal estimators and extending classical results. In particular, we establish equivalences with suitably chosen Tikhonov-regularized formulations, where the regularization depends explicitly on the distributions of the unknown signal, the noise, and the random forward operators. We also prove convergence results under appropriate source condition assumptions. Furthermore, we derive rigorous finite-sample error bounds that characterize the performance of learned estimators as a function of the noise level, problem conditioning, and number of available samples. These bounds explicitly quantify the impact of operator randomness and reveal the associated convergence rates as this randomness vanishes.

Depending on the source of log data collection, various information is recorded in logs that can be considered log modalities. In light of this intuition, unimodal methods often struggle by ignoring the different modalities of log data. Meanwhile, multimodal methods fail to handle the interactions between these modalities. Applying multimodal sentiment analysis to log anomaly detection, we propose CoLog, a framework that collaboratively encodes logs utilizing various modalities. CoLog utilizes collaborative transformers and multi-head impressed attention to learn interactions among several modalities, ensuring comprehensive anomaly detection. To handle the heterogeneity caused by these interactions, CoLog incorporates a modality adaptation layer, which adapts the representations from different log modalities. This methodology enables CoLog to learn nuanced patterns and dependencies within the data, enhancing its anomaly detection capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate CoLog's superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, in detecting both point and collective anomalies, CoLog achieves a mean precision of 99.63%, a mean recall of 99.59%, and a mean F1 score of 99.61% across seven benchmark datasets for log-based anomaly detection. The comprehensive detection capabilities of CoLog make it highly suitable for cybersecurity, system monitoring, and operational efficiency. CoLog represents a significant advancement in log anomaly detection, providing a sophisticated and effective solution to point and collective anomaly detection through a unified framework and a solution to the complex challenges automatic log data analysis poses.

However, conventional velocity model building methods are often computationally expensive and time consuming. In recent years, with the rapid advancement of deep learning, particularly the success of generative models and neural operators, deep learning based approaches that integrate data and their statistics have attracted increasing attention in addressing the limitations of traditional methods. In this study, we propose a novel framework that combines generative models with neural operators to obtain high resolution velocity models efficiently. Within this workflow, the neural operator functions as a forward mapping operator to rapidly generate time lag reverse time migration (RTM) extended images from the true and migration velocity models. In this framework, the neural operator is acting as a surrogate for modeling followed by migration, which uses the true and migration velocities, respectively. The trained neural operator is then employed, through automatic differentiation, to gradually update the migration velocity placed in the true velocity input channel with high resolution components so that the output of the network matches the time lag images of observed data obtained using the migration velocity. By embedding a generative model, trained on a high-resolution velocity model distribution, which corresponds to the true velocity model distribution used to train the neural operator, as a regularizer, the resulting predictions are cleaner with higher resolution information. Both synthetic and field data experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed generative neural operator based velocity model building approach.",

This paper addresses these computational constraints by leveraging low-bit quantization, which transforms FP16 computations into more efficient integer arithmetic. We introduce a unified low-bit inference framework, supporting INT8 (W8A8) and W4A8 quantization, specifically optimized for openPangu-Embedded models on the Atlas A2. Our comprehensive evaluation, conducted across all three CoT modes on code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP), demonstrates the efficacy of this approach. INT8 quantization consistently preserves over 90\\% of the FP16 baseline accuracy and achieves a 1.5x prefill speedup on the Atlas A2. Furthermore, W4A8 quantization significantly reduces memory consumption, albeit with a moderate trade-off in accuracy.

In comparison, existing proximal policy methods such as GRPO or CISPO use multiple gradient steps with variants of importance ratio clipping to approximate a natural gradient step relative to a reference policy. In its simplest form, ISOPO normalizes the log-probability gradient of each sequence in the Fisher metric before contracting with the advantages. Another variant of ISOPO transforms the microbatch advantages based on the neural tangent kernel in each layer. ISOPO applies this transformation layer-wise in a single backward pass and can be implemented with negligible computational overhead compared to vanilla REINFORCE.",

        "summary": "Deep learning has achieved strong performance for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification within individual datasets, yet dependable generalization across heterogeneous acquisition settings remains a major obstacle to clinical deployment and longitudinal monitoring. A key limitation of many model architectures is the implicit entanglement of morphological waveform patterns and rhythm dynamics, which can promote shortcut learning and amplify sensitivity to distribution shifts. We propose ECG-RAMBA, a framework that separates morphology and rhythm and then re-integrates them through context-aware fusion. ECG-RAMBA combines: (i) deterministic morphological features extracted by MiniRocket, (ii) global rhythm descriptors computed from heart-rate variability (HRV), and (iii) long-range contextual modeling via a bi-directional Mamba backbone. To improve sensitivity to transient abnormalities under windowed inference, we introduce a numerically stable Power Mean pooling operator ($Q=3$) that emphasizes high-evidence segments while avoiding the brittleness of max pooling and the dilution of averaging. We evaluate under a protocol-faithful setting with subject-level cross-validation, a fixed decision threshold, and no test-time adaptation. On the Chapman--Shaoxing dataset, ECG-RAMBA achieves a macro ROC-AUC $\\approx 0.85$. In zero-shot transfer, it attains PR-AUC $=0.708$ for atrial fibrillation detection on the external CPSC-2021 dataset, substantially outperforming a comparable raw-signal Mamba baseline, and shows consistent cross-dataset performance on PTB-XL. Ablation studies indicate that deterministic morphology provides a strong foundation, while explicit rhythm modeling and long-range context are critical drivers of cross-domain robustness.",

Cloud-only inference reduces device burden but introduces high latency and cost. Static edge-cloud partitions optimize a single metric and struggle when bandwidth fluctuates. We propose Splitwise, a novel Lyapunov-assisted deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework for fine-grained, adaptive partitioning of LLMs across edge and cloud environments. Splitwise decomposes transformer layers into attention heads and feed-forward sub-blocks, exposing more partition choices than layer-wise schemes. A hierarchical DRL policy, guided by Lyapunov optimization, jointly minimizes latency, energy consumption, and accuracy degradation while guaranteeing queue stability under stochastic workloads and variable network bandwidth. Splitwise also guarantees robustness via partition checkpoints with exponential backoff recovery in case of communication failures. Experiments on Jetson Orin NX, Galaxy S23, and Raspberry Pi 5 with GPT-2 (1.5B), LLaMA-7B, and LLaMA-13B show that Splitwise reduces end-to-end latency by 1.4x-2.8x and cuts energy consumption by up to 41% compared with existing partitioners. It lowers the 95th-percentile latency by 53-61% relative to cloud-only execution, while maintaining accuracy and modest memory requirements.",

Unlike soft-constrained formulations where boundary terms act as additive penalties, this work reveals that the boundary function $B$ introduces a multiplicative spatial modulation that fundamentally alters the learning landscape. A rigorous Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework for HC-PINNs is established, deriving the explicit kernel composition law. This relationship demonstrates that the boundary function $B(\\vec{x})$ functions as a spectral filter, reshaping the eigenspectrum of the neural network's native kernel. Through spectral analysis, the effective rank of the residual kernel is identified as a deterministic predictor of training convergence, superior to classical condition numbers. It is shown that widely used boundary functions can inadvertently induce spectral collapse, leading to optimization stagnation despite exact boundary satisfaction. Validated across multi-dimensional benchmarks, this framework transforms the design of boundary functions from a heuristic choice into a principled spectral optimization problem, providing a solid theoretical foundation for geometric hard constraints in scientific machine learning.",

Generally, such problems are solved by optimizing reporting odds ratio (ROR) or proportional reporting ratio (PRR). However, these methods that rely on statistical methods cannot eliminate the biased data, leading to inaccurate signal prediction. In this paper, we propose PFed-signal, a federated learning-based signal prediction model of ADR, which utilizes the Euclidean distance to eliminate the biased data from FAERS, thereby improving the accuracy of ADR prediction. Specifically, we first propose Pfed-Split, a method to split the original dataset into a split dataset based on ADR. Then we propose ADR-signal, an ADR prediction model, including a biased data identification method based on federated learning and an ADR prediction model based on Transformer. The former identifies the biased data according to the Euclidean distance and generates a clean dataset by deleting the biased data. The latter is an ADR prediction model based on Transformer trained on the clean data set. The results show that the ROR and PRR on the clean dataset are better than those of the traditional methods. Furthermore, the accuracy rate, F1 score, recall rate and AUC of PFed-Signal are 0.887, 0.890, 0.913 and 0.957 respectively, which are higher than the baselines.",

In this paper, we uncover the unfairness issue arising from imbalanced overlapping subgraphs through both empirical observations and theoretical reasoning. To address this issue, we propose FairGFL (FAIRness-aware subGraph Federated Learning), a novel algorithm that enhances cross-client fairness while maintaining model utility in a privacy-preserving manner. Specifically, FairGFL incorporates an interpretable weighted aggregation approach to enhance fairness across clients, leveraging privacy-preserving estimation of their overlapping ratios. Furthermore, FairGFL improves the tradeoff between model utility and fairness by integrating a carefully crafted regularizer into the federated composite loss function. Through extensive experiments on four benchmark graph datasets, we demonstrate that FairGFL outperforms four representative baseline algorithms in terms of both model utility and fairness.",

By keeping data local and coordinating model training through a central server, FL effectively addresses privacy concerns and reduces communication overhead. However, the limited computational power, memory, and bandwidth of IoT edge devices pose significant challenges to the efficiency and scalability of FL, especially when training deep neural networks. Various FL frameworks have been proposed to reduce computation and communication overheads through dropout or layer freezing. However, these approaches often sacrifice accuracy or neglect memory constraints. To this end, in this work, we introduce Federated Learning with Ordered Layer Freezing (FedOLF). FedOLF consistently freezes layers in a predefined order before training, significantly mitigating computation and memory requirements. To further reduce communication and energy costs, we incorporate Tensor Operation Approximation (TOA), a lightweight alternative to conventional quantization that better preserves model accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that over non-iid data, FedOLF achieves at least 0.3%, 6.4%, 5.81%, 4.4%, 6.27% and 1.29% higher accuracy than existing works respectively on EMNIST (with CNN), CIFAR-10 (with AlexNet), CIFAR-100 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), and CINIC-10 (with ResNet20 and ResNet44), along with higher energy efficiency and lower memory footprint.",

        "summary": "Online eXp-concave Optimization (OXO) is a fundamental problem in online learning. The standard algorithm, Online Newton Step (ONS), balances statistical optimality and computational practicality, guaranteeing an optimal regret of $O(d \\log T)$, where $d$ is the dimension and $T$ is the time horizon. ONS faces a computational bottleneck due to the Mahalanobis projections at each round. This step costs $Ω(d^ω)$ arithmetic operations for bounded domains, even for the unit ball, where $ω\\in (2,3]$ is the matrix-multiplication exponent. As a result, the total runtime can reach $\\tilde{O}(d^ωT)$, particularly when iterates frequently oscillate near the domain boundary. For Stochastic eXp-concave Optimization (SXO), computational cost is also a challenge. Deploying ONS with online-to-batch conversion for SXO requires $T = \\tilde{O}(d/ε)$ rounds to achieve an excess risk of $ε$, and thereby necessitates an $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$ runtime. A COLT'13 open problem posed by Koren [2013] asks for an SXO algorithm with runtime less than $\\tilde{O}(d^{ω+1}/ε)$. This paper proposes a simple variant of ONS, LightONS, which reduces the total runtime to $O(d^2 T + d^ω\\sqrt{T \\log T})$ while preserving the optimal $O(d \\log T)$ regret. LightONS implies an SXO method with runtime $\\tilde{O}(d^3/ε)$, thereby answering the open problem. Importantly, LightONS preserves the elegant structure of ONS by leveraging domain-conversion techniques from parameter-free online learning to introduce a hysteresis mechanism that delays expensive Mahalanobis projections until necessary. This design enables LightONS to serve as an efficient plug-in replacement of ONS in broader scenarios, even beyond regret minimization, including gradient-norm adaptive regret, parametric stochastic bandits, and memory-efficient online learning.",

While accurate prediction of their physicochemical properties is essential for accelerating peptide development, existing molecular language models rely on representations that fail to capture this complexity. Atom-level SMILES notation generates long token sequences and obscures cyclic topology, whereas amino-acid-level representations cannot encode the diverse chemical modifications central to modern peptide design. To bridge this representational gap, the Hierarchical Editing Language for Macromolecules (HELM) offers a unified framework enabling precise description of both monomer composition and connectivity, making it a promising foundation for peptide language modeling. Here, we propose HELM-BERT, the first encoder-based peptide language model trained on HELM notation. Based on DeBERTa, HELM-BERT is specifically designed to capture hierarchical dependencies within HELM sequences. The model is pre-trained on a curated corpus of 39,079 chemically diverse peptides spanning linear and cyclic structures. HELM-BERT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art SMILES-based language models in downstream tasks, including cyclic peptide membrane permeability prediction and peptide-protein interaction prediction. These results demonstrate that HELM's explicit monomer- and topology-aware representations offer substantial data-efficiency advantages for modeling therapeutic peptides, bridging a long-standing gap between small-molecule and protein language models.",

Even in tasks with abundant strong signals, the key to improving model performance often lies in effectively extracting weak signals. However, the lack of dedicated datasets has long constrained research. To address this, we construct the first specialized dataset for weak signal feature learning, containing 13,158 spectral samples. It features low SNR dominance (over 55% samples with SNR below 50) and extreme class imbalance (class ratio up to 29:1), providing a challenging benchmark for classification and regression in weak signal scenarios. We also propose a dual-view representation (vector + time-frequency map) and a PDVFN model tailored to low SNR, distribution skew, and dual imbalance. PDVFN extracts local sequential features and global frequency-domain structures in parallel, following principles of local enhancement, sequential modeling, noise suppression, multi-scale capture, frequency extraction, and global perception. This multi-source complementarity enhances representation for low-SNR and imbalanced data, offering a novel solution for WSL tasks like astronomical spectroscopy. Experiments show our method achieves higher accuracy and robustness in handling weak signals, high noise, and extreme class imbalance, especially in low SNR and imbalanced scenarios.

        "summary": "Integrating non-Euclidean brain imaging data with Euclidean tabular data, such as clinical and demographic information, poses a substantial challenge for medical imaging analysis, particularly in forecasting future outcomes. While machine learning and deep learning techniques have been applied successfully to cross-sectional classification and prediction tasks, effectively forecasting outcomes in longitudinal imaging studies remains challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce a time-aware graph neural network model with transformer fusion (GNN-TF). This model flexibly integrates both tabular data and dynamic brain connectivity data, leveraging the temporal order of these variables within a coherent framework. By incorporating non-Euclidean and Euclidean sources of information from a longitudinal resting-state fMRI dataset from the National Consortium on Alcohol and Neurodevelopment in Adolescence (NCANDA), the GNN-TF enables a comprehensive analysis that captures critical aspects of longitudinal imaging data. Comparative analyses against a variety of established machine learning and deep learning models demonstrate that GNN-TF outperforms these state-of-the-art methods, delivering superior predictive accuracy for predicting future tobacco usage. The end-to-end, time-aware transformer fusion structure of the proposed GNN-TF model successfully integrates multiple data modalities and leverages temporal dynamics, making it a valuable analytic tool for functional brain imaging studies focused on clinical outcome prediction.",

        "summary": "In applications with significant class imbalance or asymmetric costs, metrics such as the $F_β$-measure, AM measure, Jaccard similarity coefficient, and weighted accuracy offer more suitable evaluation criteria than standard binary classification loss. However, optimizing these metrics present significant computational and statistical challenges. Existing approaches often rely on the characterization of the Bayes-optimal classifier, and use threshold-based methods that first estimate class probabilities and then seek an optimal threshold. This leads to algorithms that are not tailored to restricted hypothesis sets and lack finite-sample performance guarantees. In this work, we introduce principled algorithms for optimizing generalized metrics, supported by $H$-consistency and finite-sample generalization bounds. Our approach reformulates metric optimization as a generalized cost-sensitive learning problem, enabling the design of novel surrogate loss functions with provable $H$-consistency guarantees. Leveraging this framework, we develop new algorithms, METRO (Metric Optimization), with strong theoretical performance guarantees.

        "summary": "Accurate identification of the penetration process relies heavily on prior feature values of penetration acceleration. However, these feature values are typically obtained through long simulation cycles and expensive computations. To overcome this limitation, this paper proposes a multi-layer Perceptron architecture, termed squeeze and excitation multi-layer perceptron (SE-MLP), which integrates a channel attention mechanism with residual connections to enable rapid prediction of acceleration feature values. Using physical parameters under different working conditions as inputs, the model outputs layer-wise acceleration features, thereby establishing a nonlinear mapping between physical parameters and penetration characteristics. Comparative experiments against conventional MLP, XGBoost, and Transformer models demonstrate that SE-MLP achieves superior prediction accuracy, generalization, and stability. Ablation studies further confirm that both the channel attention module and residual structure contribute significantly to performance gains. Numerical simulations and range recovery tests show that the discrepancies between predicted and measured acceleration peaks and pulse widths remain within acceptable engineering tolerances. These results validate the feasibility and engineering applicability of the proposed method and provide a practical basis for rapidly generating prior feature values for penetration fuzes.",

        "summary": "Modern generative and vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in scientific and medical decision support, where predicted probabilities must be both accurate and well calibrated. Despite strong empirical results with moderate data, it remains unclear when such predictions generalize uniformly across inputs, classes, or subpopulations, rather than only on average-a critical issue in biomedicine, where rare conditions and specific groups can exhibit large errors even when overall loss is low. We study this question from a finite-sample perspective and ask: under what structural assumptions can generative and VLM-based predictors achieve uniformly accurate and calibrated behavior with practical sample sizes? Rather than analyzing arbitrary parameterizations, we focus on induced families of classifiers obtained by varying prompts or semantic embeddings within a restricted representation space. When model outputs depend smoothly on a low-dimensional semantic representation-an assumption supported by spectral structure in text and joint image-text embeddings-classical uniform convergence tools yield meaningful non-asymptotic guarantees. Our main results give finite-sample uniform convergence bounds for accuracy and calibration functionals of VLM-induced classifiers under Lipschitz stability with respect to prompt embeddings. The implied sample complexity depends on intrinsic/effective dimension, not ambient embedding dimension, and we further derive spectrum-dependent bounds that make explicit how eigenvalue decay governs data requirements. We conclude with implications for data-limited biomedical modeling, including when current dataset sizes can support uniformly reliable predictions and why average calibration metrics may miss worst-case miscalibration.",

The core of OSM-L is osmosis, a process that synthesizes dense and compact representation by extracting contextual information, eliminating the need for raw data exchange between distributed entities. OSM-L iteratively aligns local data representations, enabling information diffusion and convergence into a dynamic equilibrium that captures contextual patterns. During training, it also identifies correlated data groups, functioning as a decentralized clustering mechanism.

We prove this mismatch has an asymmetric effect: the bound on log-probability mismatch scales as $(1-p)$ where $p$ is the token probability. For high-probability tokens, this bound vanishes, contributing negligibly to sequence-level mismatch. For low-probability tokens in the tail, the bound remains large, and moreover, when sampled, these tokens exhibit systematically biased mismatches that accumulate over sequences, destabilizing gradient estimation. Rather than applying post-hoc corrections, we propose constraining the RL objective to a dynamically-pruned ``safe'' vocabulary that excludes the extreme tail. By pruning such tokens, we trade large, systematically biased mismatches for a small, bounded optimization bias. Empirically, our method achieves stable training; theoretically, we bound the optimization bias introduced by vocabulary pruning.",

        "summary": "Emotional states manifest as coordinated yet heterogeneous physiological responses across central and autonomic systems, posing a fundamental challenge for multimodal representation learning in affective computing. Learning such joint dynamics is further complicated by the scarcity and subjectivity of affective annotations, which motivates the use of self-supervised learning (SSL). However, most existing SSL approaches rely on pairwise alignment objectives, which are insufficient to characterize dependencies among more than two modalities and fail to capture higher-order interactions arising from coordinated brain and autonomic responses. To address this limitation, we propose Multimodal Functional Maximum Correlation (MFMC), a principled SSL framework that maximizes higher-order multimodal dependence through a Dual Total Correlation (DTC) objective. By deriving a tight sandwich bound and optimizing it using a functional maximum correlation analysis (FMCA) based trace surrogate, MFMC captures joint multimodal interactions directly, without relying on pairwise contrastive losses. Experiments on three public affective computing benchmarks demonstrate that MFMC consistently achieves state-of-the-art or competitive performance under both subject-dependent and subject-independent evaluation protocols, highlighting its robustness to inter-subject variability. In particular, MFMC improves subject-dependent accuracy on CEAP-360VR from 78.9% to 86.8%, and subject-independent accuracy from 27.5% to 33.1% using the EDA signal alone. Moreover, MFMC remains within 0.8 percentage points of the best-performing method on the most challenging EEG subject-independent split of MAHNOB-HCI.

When $π_{\\text{roll}} \\ne π_θ$, there is approximation error between the surrogate and the true objective. Prior work has shown that this off-policy mismatch is unavoidable in modern LLM-RL due to implementation divergence, mixture-of-experts routing discontinuities, and distributed training staleness. Classical trust region bounds on the resulting error scale as $O(T^2)$ with sequence length $T$, rendering them vacuous for long-horizon tasks. We derive two tighter bounds: a Pinsker-Marginal bound scaling as $O(T^{3/2})$ and a Mixed bound scaling as $O(T)$. Crucially, both bounds depend on $D_{kl}^{tok,max}$ -- the maximum token-level KL divergence across all positions in a sequence. This is inherently a sequence-level quantity: it requires examining the entire trajectory to compute, and therefore cannot be controlled by token-independent methods like PPO clipping. We propose Trust Region Masking (TRM), which excludes entire sequences from gradient computation if any token violates the trust region, providing the first non-vacuous monotonic improvement guarantees for long-horizon LLM-RL.",

        "summary": "Explorations in fine-tuning Vision-Language Models (VLMs), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) from Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT), have made impressive progress. However, most approaches rely on explicit weight updates, overlooking the extensive representational structures already encoded in pre-trained models that remain underutilized. Recent works have demonstrated that Mask Fine-Tuning (MFT) can be a powerful and efficient post-training paradigm for language models. Instead of updating weights, MFT assigns learnable gating scores to each weight, allowing the model to reorganize its internal subnetworks for downstream task adaptation. In this paper, we rethink fine-tuning for VLMs from a structural reparameterization perspective grounded in MFT. We apply MFT to the language and projector components of VLMs with different language backbones and compare against strong PEFT baselines. Experiments show that MFT consistently surpasses LoRA variants and even full fine-tuning, achieving high performance without altering the frozen backbone. Our findings reveal that effective adaptation can emerge not only from updating weights but also from reestablishing connections among the model's existing knowledge.

To this end, we propose \\textbf{FLEX-MoE}, a novel federated MoE framework that jointly optimizes expert assignment and load balancing under limited client capacity. Specifically, our approach introduces client-expert fitness scores that quantify the expert suitability for local datasets through training feedback, and employs an optimization-based algorithm to maximize client-expert specialization while enforcing balanced expert utilization system-wide. Unlike existing greedy methods that focus solely on personalization while ignoring load imbalance, our FLEX-MoE is capable of addressing the expert utilization skew, which is particularly severe in FL settings with heterogeneous data. Our comprehensive experiments on three different datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed FLEX-MoE, together with its ability to maintain balanced expert utilization across diverse resource-constrained scenarios.",

Unlike parallel prefix scans that exhibit numerical divergence in stiff ODE regimes, PGF ensures stability through invariant error scaling, maintaining near-machine precision across extreme sequences. We demonstrate the utility of PGF on an impulse-response benchmark with 128,000-step sequences - a scale where conventional Autograd encounters prohibitive memory overhead, often leading to out-of-memory (OOM) failures in multi-layered models.

However, existing multi-operator learning approaches are data-hungry and neglect physics during training. Here, we propose a physics-informed multimodal foundation model (PI-MFM) framework that directly enforces governing equations during pretraining and adaptation. PI-MFM takes symbolic representations of PDEs as the input, and automatically assembles PDE residual losses from the input expression via a vectorized derivative computation. These designs enable any PDE-encoding multimodal foundation model to be trained or adapted with unified physics-informed objectives across equation families. On a benchmark of 13 parametric one-dimensional time-dependent PDE families, PI-MFM consistently outperforms purely data-driven counterparts, especially with sparse labeled spatiotemporal points, partially observed time domains, or few labeled function pairs. Physics losses further improve robustness against noise, and simple strategies such as resampling collocation points substantially improve accuracy. We also analyze the accuracy, precision, and computational cost of automatic differentiation and finite differences for derivative computation within PI-MFM. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot physics-informed fine-tuning to unseen PDE families: starting from a physics-informed pretrained model, adapting using only PDE residuals and initial/boundary conditions, without any labeled solution data, rapidly reduces test errors to around 1% and clearly outperforms physics-only training from scratch.

However, these methods not only ignore growing computational memory with tasks and limited storage space but also suffer from potential task interference due to the lack of effective LoRA merging mechanisms. In this paper, we propose a novel continual learning method that orthogonally initializes and sequentially merges LoRAs updates into a single unified LoRA. Our method leverages orthogonal basis extraction from previously learned LoRA to initialize the learning of new tasks, further exploits the intrinsic asymmetry property of LoRA components by using a time-aware scaling mechanism to balance new and old knowledge during continual merging. Our approach maintains constant memory complexity with respect to the number of tasks, minimizes interference between past and new tasks via orthogonal basis initialization, and improves performance over asymmetric LoRA merging via adaptive scaling.

This work proposes a context-aware and interpretable framework for single-channel EEG sleep staging, with particular emphasis on improving detection of the N1 stage. Many prior models operate as black boxes with stacked layers, lacking clearly defined and interpretable feature extraction roles.The proposed model combines compact multi-scale feature extraction with temporal modeling to capture both local and long-range dependencies. To address data imbalance, especially in the N1 stage, classweighted loss functions and data augmentation are applied. EEG signals are segmented into sub-epoch chunks, and final predictions are obtained by averaging softmax probabilities across chunks, enhancing contextual representation and robustness.The proposed framework achieves an overall accuracy of 89.72% and a macro-average F1-score of 85.46%. Notably, it attains an F1- score of 61.7% for the challenging N1 stage, demonstrating a substantial improvement over previous methods on the SleepEDF datasets.

This poses challenges for reproducible research, methodological benchmarking, and education in domains such as stress modeling, behavioral analysis, and machine learning. We introduce FLOW, a synthetic longitudinal dataset designed to model daily interactions between workload, lifestyle behaviors, and wellbeing. FLOW is generated using a rule-based, feedback-driven simulation that produces coherent temporal dynamics across variables such as stress, sleep, mood, physical activity, and body weight. The dataset simulates 1{,}000 individuals over a two-year period with daily resolution and is released as a publicly available resource. In addition to the static dataset, we describe a configurable data generation tool that enables reproducible experimentation under adjustable behavioral and contextual assumptions. FLOW is intended as a controlled experimental environment rather than a proxy for observed human populations, supporting exploratory analysis, methodological development, and benchmarking where real-world data are inaccessible.",

Supervised fine-tuning and many distillation-style objectives implicitly minimize the forward KL divergence KL(q || pi_theta), yielding stable mode-covering updates but often under-exploiting high-reward modes. In contrast, PPO-style online reinforcement learning from human feedback behaves closer to reverse KL divergence KL(pi_theta || q), enabling mode-seeking improvements but risking mode collapse. Recent anchored methods, such as ADPO, show that performing the projection in anchored coordinates can substantially improve stability, yet they typically commit to a single divergence. We introduce Alpha-Divergence Preference Optimization (APO), an anchored framework that uses Csiszar alpha-divergence to continuously interpolate between forward and reverse KL behavior within the same anchored geometry. We derive unified gradient dynamics parameterized by alpha, analyze gradient variance properties, and propose a practical reward-and-confidence-guarded alpha schedule that transitions from coverage to exploitation only when the policy is both improving and confidently calibrated. Experiments on Qwen3-1.7B with math-level3 demonstrate that APO achieves competitive performance with GRPO and GSPO baselines while maintaining training stability.",

MTD can be computed directly from pre-trained models with multiple prediction heads, requiring no additional training. Building on this, we introduce Divergence Steering, a novel decoding method to control the computational character of generated text. We empirically show that MTD is more effective than prior methods at distinguishing complex tasks from simple ones. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, MTD correlates positively with problem difficulty. Lower MTD is associated with more accurate reasoning.

In Phase 2, the ensemble is distilled into a larger network and fine-tuned with standard Double DQN. We prove theoretically that satisficing induces bounded updates and cannot increase target variance, with a corollary quantifying conditions for substantial reduction. Empirically, Sat-EnQ achieves 3.8x variance reduction, eliminates catastrophic failures (0% vs 50% for DQN), maintains 79% performance under environmental noise}, and requires 2.5x less compute than bootstrapped ensembles.

So far, many research works have used deep learning models to explore the complex interactions between students, questions, and skills. However, the performance of existing method is frequently limited by the long-tailed distribution and dynamic changes in the data. To address these challenges, we propose a meta-learning framework for cognitive diagnosis based on continual learning (MetaCD). This framework can alleviate the long-tailed problem by utilizing meta-learning to learn the optimal initialization state, enabling the model to achieve good accuracy on new tasks with only a small amount of data. In addition, we utilize a continual learning method named parameter protection mechanism to give MetaCD the ability to adapt to new skills or new tasks, in order to adapt to dynamic changes in data. MetaCD can not only improve the plasticity of our model on a single task, but also ensure the stability and generalization of the model on sequential tasks. Comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that MetaCD outperforms other baselines in both accuracy and generalization.",

        "summary": "Spectral clustering has emerged as one of the most effective clustering algorithms due to its superior performance. However, most existing models are designed for centralized settings, rendering them inapplicable in modern decentralized environments. Moreover, current federated learning approaches often suffer from poor generalization performance due to reliance on unreliable pseudo-labels, and fail to capture the latent correlations amongst heterogeneous clients. To tackle these limitations, this paper proposes a novel framework named Federated Multi-Task Clustering (i.e.,FMTC), which intends to learn personalized clustering models for heterogeneous clients while collaboratively leveraging their shared underlying structure in a privacy-preserving manner. More specifically, the FMTC framework is composed of two main components: client-side personalized clustering module, which learns a parameterized mapping model to support robust out-of-sample inference, bypassing the need for unreliable pseudo-labels; and server-side tensorial correlation module, which explicitly captures the shared knowledge across all clients. This is achieved by organizing all client models into a unified tensor and applying a low-rank regularization to discover their common subspace. To solve this joint optimization problem, we derive an efficient, privacy-preserving distributed algorithm based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers, which decomposes the global problem into parallel local updates on clients and an aggregation step on the server. To the end, several extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate that our proposed FMTC framework significantly outperforms various baseline and state-of-the-art federated clustering algorithms.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance but face critical challenges: hallucinations and high inference costs. Leveraging multiple experts offers a solution: deferring uncertain inputs to more capable experts improves reliability, while routing simpler queries to smaller, distilled models enhances efficiency. This motivates the problem of learning with multiple-expert deferral. This thesis presents a comprehensive study of this problem and the related problem of learning with abstention, supported by strong consistency guarantees. First, for learning with abstention (a special case of deferral), we analyze score-based and predictor-rejector formulations in multi-class classification. We introduce new families of surrogate losses and prove strong non-asymptotic, hypothesis set-specific consistency guarantees, resolving two existing open questions. We analyze both single-stage and practical two-stage settings, with experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN demonstrating the superior performance of our algorithms. Second, we address general multi-expert deferral in classification. We design new surrogate losses for both single-stage and two-stage scenarios and prove they benefit from strong $H$-consistency bounds. For the two-stage scenario, we show that our surrogate losses are realizable $H$-consistent for constant cost functions, leading to effective new algorithms. Finally, we introduce a novel framework for regression with deferral to address continuous label spaces. Our versatile framework accommodates multiple experts and various cost structures, supporting both single-stage and two-stage methods. It subsumes recent work on regression with abstention. We propose new surrogate losses with proven $H$-consistency and demonstrate the empirical effectiveness of the resulting algorithms.",

We present an in-depth study of the target loss estimation error relative to the surrogate loss estimation error. Our analysis leads to $H$-consistency bounds, which are guarantees accounting for the hypothesis set $H$. These bounds offer stronger guarantees than Bayes-consistency or $H$-calibration and are more informative than excess error bounds. We begin with binary classification, establishing tight distribution-dependent and -independent bounds. We provide explicit bounds for convex surrogates (including linear models and neural networks) and analyze the adversarial setting for surrogates like $ρ$-margin and sigmoid loss. Extending to multi-class classification, we present the first $H$-consistency bounds for max, sum, and constrained losses, covering both non-adversarial and adversarial scenarios. We demonstrate that in some cases, non-trivial $H$-consistency bounds are unattainable. We also investigate comp-sum losses (e.g., cross-entropy, MAE), deriving their first $H$-consistency bounds and introducing smooth adversarial variants that yield robust learning algorithms. We develop a comprehensive framework for deriving these bounds across various surrogates, introducing new characterizations for constrained and comp-sum losses. Finally, we examine the growth rates of $H$-consistency bounds, establishing a universal square-root growth rate for smooth surrogates in binary and multi-class tasks, and analyze minimizability gaps to guide surrogate selection.",

In this framework, the teacher module dynamically prioritizes goals with the highest temporal variance in the policy's confidence score, parameterized by the state-action value (Q) function. The teacher provides an adaptive and focused learning signal by targeting these high-uncertainty goals, fostering continual and efficient progress. We establish a theoretical connection between the temporal variance of Q-values and the evolution of the policy, providing insights into the method's underlying principles. Our approach is algorithm-agnostic and integrates seamlessly with existing RL frameworks. We demonstrate this through evaluation across 11 diverse robotic manipulation and maze navigation tasks.

        "summary": "Accurate long-range weather forecasting remains a major challenge for AI models, both because errors accumulate over autoregressive rollouts and because reanalysis datasets used for training offer a limited sample of the slow modes of climate variability underpinning predictability. Most AI weather models are autoregressive, producing short lead forecasts that must be repeatedly applied to reach subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) or seasonal lead times, often resulting in instability and calibration issues. Long-timestep probabilistic models that generate long-range forecasts in a single step offer an attractive alternative, but training on the 40-year reanalysis record leads to overfitting, suggesting orders of magnitude more training data are required. We introduce long-range distillation, a method that trains a long-timestep probabilistic \"student\" model to forecast directly at long-range using a huge synthetic training dataset generated by a short-timestep autoregressive \"teacher\" model. Using the Deep Learning Earth System Model (DLESyM) as the teacher, we generate over 10,000 years of simulated climate to train distilled student models for forecasting across a range of timescales. In perfect-model experiments, the distilled models outperform climatology and approach the skill of their autoregressive teacher while replacing hundreds of autoregressive steps with a single timestep. In the real world, they achieve S2S forecast skill comparable to the ECMWF ensemble forecast after ERA5 fine-tuning. The skill of our distilled models scales with increasing synthetic training data, even when that data is orders of magnitude larger than ERA5. This represents the first demonstration that AI-generated synthetic training data can be used to scale long-range forecast skill.",

This work highlights the potential of dynamic, property-aware quantization while preserving model quality. We believe this approach can generally improve the robustness of low precision training, as demonstrated by achieving FP8 accuracies that are on par with existing approaches without the need for fine-grain partitioning, or can be used in combination with other training methods to improve the leverage of even lower precision number formats such as NVFP4.",

This RL driven approach dynamically guides the student to explore multiple denoising paths, allowing it to take longer, optimized steps toward high-probability regions of the data distribution, rather than relying on incremental refinements. Our framework utilizes the inherent ability of diffusion models to handle larger steps and effectively manage the generative process. Experimental results show that our method achieves superior performance with significantly fewer inference steps and computational resources compared to existing distillation techniques.

Existing methods predominantly rely on Euclidean distance, failing to adequately account for anisotropic gas feature distributions and dynamic signal intensity variations. To address these issues, this study proposes SNM-Net, a universal deep learning framework for open-set gas recognition. The core innovation lies in a geometric decoupling mechanism achieved through cascaded batch normalization and L2 normalization, which projects high-dimensional features onto a unit hypersphere to eliminate signal intensity fluctuations. Additionally, Mahalanobis distance is introduced as the scoring mechanism, utilizing class-wise statistics to construct adaptive ellipsoidal decision boundaries. SNM-Net is architecture-agnostic and seamlessly integrates with CNN, RNN, and Transformer backbones. Systematic experiments on the Vergara dataset demonstrate that the Transformer+SNM configuration attains near-theoretical performance, achieving an AUROC of 0.9977 and an unknown gas detection rate of 99.57% (TPR at 5% FPR). This performance significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, showing a 3.0% improvement in AUROC and a 91.0% reduction in standard deviation compared to Class Anchor Clustering. The framework exhibits exceptional robustness across sensor positions with standard deviations below 0.0028.

        "summary": "Dynamic graphs are widely used to represent evolving real-world networks. Temporal Graph Neural Networks (TGNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for processing such graphs, but the lack of transparency and explainability limits their practical adoption. Research on TGNN explainability is still in its early stages and faces several key issues: (i) Current methods are tailored to specific TGNN types, restricting generality. (ii) They suffer from high computational costs, making them unsuitable for large-scale networks. (iii) They often overlook the structural connectivity of explanations and require prior knowledge, reducing user-friendliness. To address these issues, we propose GRExplainer, the first universal, efficient, and user-friendly explanation method for TGNNs. GRExplainer extracts node sequences as a unified feature representation, making it independent of specific input formats and thus applicable to both snapshot-based and event-based TGNNs (the major types of TGNNs). By utilizing breadth-first search and temporal information to construct input node sequences, GRExplainer reduces redundant computation and improves efficiency. To enhance user-friendliness, we design a generative model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), enabling automated and continuous explanation generation. Experiments on six real-world datasets with three target TGNNs show that GRExplainer outperforms existing baseline methods in generality, efficiency, and user-friendliness.",

        "summary": "The growing scale of deep learning models has rendered standard hyperparameter (HP) optimization prohibitively expensive. A promising solution is the use of scale-aware hyperparameters, which can enable direct transfer of optimal HPs from small-scale grid searches to large models with minimal performance loss. To understand the principles governing such transfer strategy, we develop a general conceptual framework for reasoning about HP transfer across scale, characterizing transfer as fast when the suboptimality it induces vanishes asymptotically faster than the finite-scale performance gap. We show formally that fast transfer is equivalent to useful transfer for compute-optimal grid search, meaning that transfer is asymptotically more compute-efficient than direct tuning. While empirical work has found that the Maximal Update Parameterization ($μ$P) exhibits fast transfer when scaling model width, the mechanisms remain poorly understood. We show that this property depends critically on problem structure by presenting synthetic settings where transfer either offers provable computational advantage or fails to outperform direct tuning even under $μ$P. To explain the fast transfer observed in practice, we conjecture that decomposing the optimization trajectory reveals two contributions to loss reduction: (1) a width-stable component that determines the optimal HPs, and (2) a width-sensitive component that improves with width but weakly perturbs the HP optimum. We present empirical evidence for this hypothesis across various settings, including large language model pretraining.",

Traditional epidemiological studies typically analyze these levels independently, limiting insights into how structural environmental conditions interact with individual-level characteristics to influence health outcomes. In this study, we introduce a micro-macro machine learning framework that integrates (1) individual-level anthropometric and socioeconomic data from NHANES and (2) macro-level structural environment features, including food access, air quality, and socioeconomic vulnerability extracted from USDA and EPA datasets. Four machine learning models Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and LightGBM were trained to predict obesity using NHANES microdata. XGBoost achieved the strongest performance. A composite environmental vulnerability index (EnvScore) was constructed using normalized indicators from USDA and EPA at the state level. Multi-level comparison revealed strong geographic similarity between states with high environmental burden and the nationally predicted micro-level obesity risk distribution. This demonstrates the feasibility of integrating multi-scale datasets to identify environment-driven disparities in obesity risk. This work contributes a scalable, data-driven, multi-level modeling pipeline suitable for public health informatics, demonstrating strong potential for expansion into causal modeling, intervention planning, and real-time analytics.",

Ensuring the reliability and executability of such systems requires validating generated SQL, but most existing approaches focus only on syntactic correctness, with few addressing semantic validation (detecting misalignments between questions and SQL). As a consequence, effective semantic validation still faces two key challenges: capturing both global user intent and SQL structural details, and constructing high-quality fine-grained sub-SQL annotations. To tackle these, we introduce HEROSQL, a hierarchical SQL representation approach that integrates global intent (via Logical Plans, LPs) and local details (via Abstract Syntax Trees, ASTs). To enable better information propagation, we employ a Nested Message Passing Neural Network (NMPNN) to capture inherent relational information in SQL and aggregate schema-guided semantics across LPs and ASTs. Additionally, to generate high-quality negative samples, we propose an AST-driven sub-SQL augmentation strategy, supporting robust optimization of fine-grained semantic inconsistencies. Extensive experiments conducted on Text-to-SQL validation benchmarks (both in-domain and out-of-domain settings) demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average 9.40% improvement of AUPRC and 12.35% of AUROC in identifying semantic inconsistencies. It excels at detecting fine-grained semantic errors, provides large language models with more granular feedback, and ultimately enhances the reliability and interpretability of data querying platforms.",

We aim to make sense of the current design space of deep learning architectures for time series forecasting by discussing the design dimensions and trade-offs that can explain, often unexpected, observed results. This paper discusses the necessity of grounding model design on principles for forecasting groups of time series and how such principles can be applied to current models. In particular, we assess how concepts such as locality and globality apply to recent forecasting architectures. We show that accounting for these aspects can be more relevant for achieving accurate results than adopting specific sequence modeling layers and that simple, well-designed forecasting architectures can often match the state of the art. We discuss how overlooked implementation details in existing architectures (1) fundamentally change the class of the resulting forecasting method and (2) drastically affect the observed empirical results. Our results call for rethinking current faulty benchmarking practices and the need to focus on the foundational aspects of the forecasting problem when designing architectures. As a step in this direction, we propose an auxiliary forecasting model card, whose fields serve to characterize existing and new forecasting architectures based on key design choices.",

We consider multiple tasks, each with a finite number of data samples, where the observations follow a linear model with task-specific parameters. In the decentralized setting, task data are distributed across multiple nodes, and information exchange between nodes is constrained by a communication network. The goal is to recover the underlying feature matrix whose rank is much smaller than both the parameter dimension and the number of tasks. We propose a new alternating projected gradient and minimization algorithm with provable accuracy guarantees. We provide comprehensive characterizations of the time, communication, and sample complexities. Importantly, the communication complexity is independent of the target accuracy, which significantly reduces communication cost compared to prior methods.

Biased compression techniques are effective in practice, but require error feedback mechanisms to provide theoretical guarantees and to ensure convergence when compression is aggressive. Standard error feedback, however, relies on client-specific control variates, which violates user privacy and is incompatible with stateless clients common in large-scale FL. This paper proposes two novel frameworks that enable biased compression without client-side state or control variates. The first, Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe), uses the globally aggregated update from the previous round as a shared control variate for all clients. The second, Server-Guided Compressed Aggregate Feedback (CAFe-S), extends this idea to scenarios where the server possesses a small private dataset; it generates a server-guided candidate update to be used as a more accurate predictor. We consider Distributed Gradient Descent (DGD) as a representative algorithm and analytically prove CAFe's superiority to Distributed Compressed Gradient Descent (DCGD) with biased compression in the non-convex regime with bounded gradient dissimilarity. We further prove that CAFe-S converges to a stationary point, with a rate that improves as the server's data become more representative.

In this paper, an artificial intelligence-based algorithm for daily and monthly gold forecasting is presented. Two Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks are responsible for daily and monthly forecasting, the results of which are integrated into a Multilayer perceptrons (MLP) network and provide the final forecast of the next day prices. The algorithm forecasts the highest, lowest, and closing prices on the daily and monthly time frame. Based on these forecasts, a trading strategy for live market trading was developed, according to which the proposed model had a return of 171% in three months. Also, the number of internal neurons in each network is optimized by the Gray Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm based on the least RMSE error. The dataset was collected between 2010 and 2021 and includes data on macroeconomic, energy markets, stocks, and currency status of developed countries.

In this model, recurrent neural networks forecast prices in a parallel and independent way. The parallel networks utilize different inputs, each representing distinct price-related features. Finally, the outputs of the parallel networks are combined by a neural network to forecast the future price of cryptocurrencies. The experimental results indicate that the proposed model achieves mean absolute percentage errors (MAPE) of 3.243% and 2.641% for window lengths 20 and 15, respectively.

Current learning-based approaches often suffer from a fragmented paradigm: generative models capture diversity but lack reliable energy calibration, whereas deterministic predictors target a single structure and fail to represent ensemble variability. Here we present EnFlow, a unified framework that couples flow matching (FM) with an explicitly learned energy model through an energy-guided sampling scheme defined along a non-Gaussian FM path. By incorporating energy-gradient guidance during sampling, our method steers trajectories toward lower-energy regions, substantially improving conformational fidelity, particularly in the few-step regime. The learned energy function further enables efficient energy-based ranking of generated ensembles for accurate ground-state identification. Extensive experiments on GEOM-QM9 and GEOM-Drugs demonstrate that EnFlow simultaneously improves generation metrics with 1--2 ODE-steps and reduces ground-state prediction errors compared with state-of-the-art methods.",

Recently, crash data has increasingly revealed that AV behavior can deviate from expected safety outcomes, raising concerns about the technology's safety and operational reliability in mixed traffic environments. While past research has investigated AV crash, most studies rely on small-size California-centered datasets, with a limited focus on understanding crash trends across various SAE Levels of automation. This study analyzes over 2,500 AV crash records from the United States National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), covering SAE Levels 2 and 4, to uncover underlying crash dynamics. A two-stage data mining framework is developed. K-means clustering is first applied to segment crash records into 4 distinct behavioral clusters based on temporal, spatial, and environmental factors. Then, Association Rule Mining (ARM) is used to extract interpretable multivariate relationships between crash patterns and crash contributors including lighting conditions, surface condition, vehicle dynamics, and environmental conditions within each cluster. These insights provide actionable guidance for AV developers, safety regulators, and policymakers in formulating AV deployment strategies and minimizing crash risks.",

        "summary": "Rank-based input normalization is a workhorse of modern machine learning, prized for its robustness to scale, monotone transformations, and batch-to-batch variation. In many real systems, the ordering of feature values matters far more than their raw magnitudes - yet the structural conditions that a rank-based normalization operator must satisfy to remain stable under these invariances have never been formally pinned down. We show that widely used differentiable sorting and ranking operators fundamentally fail these criteria. Because they rely on value gaps and batch-level pairwise interactions, they are intrinsically unstable under strictly monotone transformations, shifts in mini-batch composition, and even tiny input perturbations. Crucially, these failures stem from the operators' structural design, not from incidental implementation choices. To address this, we propose three axioms that formalize the minimal invariance and stability properties required of rank-based input normalization. We prove that any operator satisfying these axioms must factor into (i) a feature-wise rank representation and (ii) a scalarization map that is both monotone and Lipschitz-continuous. We then construct a minimal operator that meets these criteria and empirically show that the resulting constraints are non-trivial in realistic setups. Together, our results sharply delineate the design space of valid rank-based normalization operators and formally separate them from existing continuous-relaxation-based sorting methods.",

However, in time-series forecasting, prior work has predominantly focused on encoder design, often treating prediction and training as separate or secondary concerns. In this paper, we propose TimePerceiver, a unified encoder-decoder forecasting framework that is tightly aligned with an effective training strategy. To be specific, we first generalize the forecasting task to include diverse temporal prediction objectives such as extrapolation, interpolation, and imputation. Since this generalization requires handling input and target segments that are arbitrarily positioned along the temporal axis, we design a novel encoder-decoder architecture that can flexibly perceive and adapt to these varying positions. For encoding, we introduce a set of latent bottleneck representations that can interact with all input segments to jointly capture temporal and cross-channel dependencies. For decoding, we leverage learnable queries corresponding to target timestamps to effectively retrieve relevant information. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework consistently and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art baselines across a wide range of benchmark datasets.

While improved surrogate gradient methods have been proposed, their effectiveness under strong adversarial attacks remains unclear. We propose a more reliable framework for evaluating SNN adversarial robustness. We theoretically analyze the degree of gradient vanishing in surrogate gradients and introduce the Adaptive Sharpness Surrogate Gradient (ASSG), which adaptively evolves the shape of the surrogate function according to the input distribution during attack iterations, thereby enhancing gradient accuracy while mitigating gradient vanishing. In addition, we design an adversarial attack with adaptive step size under the $L_\\infty$ constraint-Stable Adaptive Projected Gradient Descent (SA-PGD), achieving faster and more stable convergence under imprecise gradients. Extensive experiments show that our approach substantially increases attack success rates across diverse adversarial training schemes, SNN architectures and neuron models, providing a more generalized and reliable evaluation of SNN adversarial robustness. The experimental results further reveal that the robustness of current SNNs has been significantly overestimated and highlighting the need for more dependable adversarial training methods.",

Task vectors, defined as the difference between fine-tuned and pre-trained model parameters, provide a mechanism for steering neural networks toward desired behaviors. This has given rise to large repositories dedicated to task vectors tailored for specific behaviors. The arithmetic operation of these task vectors allows for the seamless combination of desired behaviors without the need for large datasets. However, these vectors often contain overlapping concepts that can interfere with each other during arithmetic operations, leading to unpredictable outcomes. We propose a principled decomposition method that separates each task vector into two components: one capturing shared knowledge across multiple task vectors, and another isolating information unique to each specific task. By identifying invariant subspaces across projections, our approach enables more precise control over concept manipulation without unintended amplification or diminution of other behaviors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our decomposition method across three domains: improving multi-task merging in image classification by 5% using shared components as additional task vectors, enabling clean style mixing in diffusion models without generation degradation by mixing only the unique components, and achieving 47% toxicity reduction in language models while preserving performance on general knowledge tasks by negating the toxic information isolated to the unique component.

While significant efforts have been made to detect and mitigate such hallucinations, predicting whether an LLM's response is correct remains a critical yet underexplored problem. This study investigates the feasibility of predicting correctness by analyzing a general-purpose model (GPT-4o) and a reasoning-centric model (OSS-120B) on a multiple-choice prosthodontics exam. We utilize metadata and hallucination signals across three distinct prompting strategies to build a correctness predictor for each (model, prompting) pair. Our findings demonstrate that this metadata-based approach can improve accuracy by up to +7.14% and achieve a precision of 83.12% over a baseline that assumes all answers are correct. We further show that while actual hallucination is a strong indicator of incorrectness, metadata signals alone are not reliable predictors of hallucination. Finally, we reveal that prompting strategies, despite not affecting overall accuracy, significantly alter the models' internal behaviors and the predictive utility of their metadata. These results present a promising direction for developing reliability signals in LLMs but also highlight that the methods explored in this paper are not yet robust enough for critical, high-stakes deployment.",

Our key finding is that LTH holds within LoRAs, revealing sparse subnetworks that can match the performance of dense adapters. In particular, we find that the effectiveness of sparse subnetworks depends more on how much sparsity is applied in each layer than on the exact weights included in the subnetwork. Building on this insight, we propose Partial-LoRA, a method that systematically identifies said subnetworks and trains sparse low-rank adapters aligned with task-relevant subspaces of the pre-trained model. Experiments across 8 vision and 12 language tasks in both single-task and multi-task settings show that Partial-LoRA reduces the number of trainable parameters by up to 87\\%, while maintaining or improving accuracy.

Existing solutions typically rely on periodic classifier retraining, resulting in high computational overhead and the risk of catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a scalable framework for adaptive IoT threat detection that eliminates the need for continuous classifier retraining. The proposed approach trains a classifier once on latent-space representations of historical traffic, while an alignment model maps incoming traffic to the learned historical latent space prior to classification, thereby preserving knowledge of previously observed attacks. To capture inter-instance relationships among attack samples, the low-dimensional latent representations are further transformed into a graph-structured format and classified using a graph neural network. Experimental evaluations on real-world heterogeneous IoT traffic datasets demonstrate that the proposed framework maintains robust detection performance under concept drift. These results highlight the framework's potential for practical deployment in dynamic and large-scale IoT environments.",

We address this by constructing \\emph{Bayesian wind tunnels} -- controlled environments where the true posterior is known in closed form and memorization is provably impossible. In these settings, small transformers reproduce Bayesian posteriors with \\mbox{$10^{-3}$--$10^{-4}$} bit accuracy, while capacity-matched MLPs fail by orders of magnitude, establishing a clear architectural separation. Across two tasks -- bijection elimination and Hidden Markov Model (HMM) state tracking -- we find that transformers implement Bayesian inference through a consistent geometric mechanism: residual streams serve as the belief substrate, feed-forward networks perform the posterior update, and attention provides content-addressable routing. Geometric diagnostics reveal orthogonal key bases, progressive query--key alignment, and a low-dimensional value manifold parameterized by posterior entropy. During training this manifold unfurls while attention patterns remain stable, a \\emph{frame--precision dissociation} predicted by recent gradient analyses. Taken together, these results demonstrate that hierarchical attention realizes Bayesian inference by geometric design, explaining both the necessity of attention and the failure of flat architectures.

Yet, new target domains often require domain expansion: a generalized model that performs well beyond any single specialist's domain.

However, heuristic blending -- using coefficients based on data size or proxy metrics -- often yields lower target-domain test accuracy, and learning the coefficients on the target loss typically requires computationally-expensive full backpropagation through the network. We propose GLUE, Gradient-free Learning To Unify Experts, which initializes the target model as a convex combination of fixed experts, learning the mixture coefficients of this combination via a gradient-free two-point (SPSA) update that requires only two forward passes per step. Across experiments on three datasets and three network architectures, GLUE produces a single prior that can be fine-tuned effectively to outperform baselines. GLUE improves test accuracy by up to 8.5% over data-size weighting and by up to 9.1% over proxy-metric selection.

To address this critical \"safety gap,\" we propose CRC (Causality-inspired Safe Residual Correction), a plug-and-play framework explicitly designed to ensure non-degradation. CRC follows a divide-and-conquer philosophy: it employs a causality-inspired encoder to expose direction-aware structure by decoupling self- and cross-variable dynamics, and a hybrid corrector to model residual errors. Crucially, the correction process is governed by a strict four-fold safety mechanism that prevents harmful updates. Experiments across multiple datasets and forecasting backbones show that CRC consistently improves accuracy, while an in-depth ablation study confirms that its core safety mechanisms ensure exceptionally high non-degradation rates (NDR), making CRC a correction framework suited for safe and reliable deployment.",

To handle scaling along most important scaling axes, we propose the Complete$^{(d)}$ Parameterisation that unifies scaling in width and depth -- using an adaptation of CompleteP -- as well as in batch-size and training duration. Secondly, with our parameterisation, we investigate per-module hyperparameter optimisation and transfer. We characterise the empirical challenges of navigating the high-dimensional hyperparameter landscape, and propose practical guidelines for tackling this optimisation problem. We demonstrate that, with the right parameterisation, hyperparameter transfer holds even in the per-module hyperparameter regime. Our study covers an extensive range of optimisation hyperparameters of modern models: learning rates, AdamW parameters, weight decay, initialisation scales, and residual block multipliers.

Our instruction-tuning experiments show that LoRA-based supervised fine-tuning can catastrophically degrade model capabilities, even when trained on very small datasets for relatively few steps. With that said, we demonstrate that while the most straightforward approach (that is likely the most used in practice) fails spectacularly, small tweaks to the training procedure with very little overhead can virtually eliminate the problem. Particularly, in this paper we consider a regularized approximate replay approach which penalizes KL divergence with respect to the initial model and interleaves in data for next token prediction from a different, yet similar, open access corpus to what was used in pre-training. When applied to Qwen instruction-tuned models, we find that this recipe preserves general knowledge in the model without hindering plasticity to new tasks by adding a modest amount of computational overhead.",

        "summary": "Bitcoin price forecasting is characterized by extreme volatility and non-stationarity, often defying traditional univariate time-series models over long horizons. This paper addresses a critical gap by integrating Global M2 Liquidity, aggregated from 18 major economies, as a leading exogenous variable with a 12-week lag structure. Using the TimeXer architecture, we compare a liquidity-conditioned forecasting model (TimeXer-Exog) against state-of-the-art benchmarks including LSTM, N-BEATS, PatchTST, and a standard univariate TimeXer. Experiments conducted on daily Bitcoin price data from January 2020 to August 2025 demonstrate that explicit macroeconomic conditioning significantly stabilizes long-horizon forecasts. At a 70-day forecast horizon, the proposed TimeXer-Exog model achieves a mean squared error (MSE) 1.08e8, outperforming the univariate TimeXer baseline by over 89 percent. These results highlight that conditioning deep learning models on global liquidity provides substantial improvements in long-horizon Bitcoin price forecasting.",

        "summary": "Probabilistic knowledge graph embeddings represent entities as distributions, using learned variances to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We identify a fundamental limitation: these variances are relation-agnostic, meaning an entity receives identical uncertainty regardless of relational context. This conflates two distinct out-of-distribution phenomena that behave oppositely: emerging entities (rare, poorly-learned) and novel relational contexts (familiar entities in unobserved relationships). We prove an impossibility result: any uncertainty estimator using only entity-level statistics independent of relation context achieves near-random OOD detection on novel contexts. We empirically validate this on three datasets, finding 100 percent of novel-context triples have frequency-matched in-distribution counterparts. This explains why existing probabilistic methods achieve 0.99 AUROC on random corruptions but only 0.52-0.64 on temporal distribution shift. We formalize uncertainty decomposition into complementary components: semantic uncertainty from entity embedding variance (detecting emerging entities) and structural uncertainty from entity-relation co-occurrence (detecting novel contexts). Our main theoretical result proves these signals are non-redundant, and that any convex combination strictly dominates either signal alone. Our method (CAGP) combines semantic and structural uncertainty via learned weights, achieving 0.94-0.99 AUROC on temporal OOD detection across multiple benchmarks, a 60-80 percent relative improvement over relation-agnostic baselines. Empirical validation confirms complete frequency overlap on three datasets (FB15k-237, WN18RR, YAGO3-10). On selective prediction, our method reduces errors by 43 percent at 85 percent answer rate.",

We study online learning of a one-dimensional threshold policy from bandit feedback under demographic parity (DP) and, optionally, service-rate constraints. The learner observes only a scalar score each round and selects a threshold; reward and constraint residuals are revealed only for the chosen threshold. We propose Optimistic Feasible Search (OFS), a simple grid-based method that maintains confidence bounds for reward and constraint residuals for each candidate threshold. At each round, OFS selects a threshold that appears feasible under confidence bounds and, among those, maximizes optimistic reward; if no threshold appears feasible, OFS selects the threshold minimizing optimistic constraint violation. This design directly targets feasible high-utility thresholds and is particularly effective for low-dimensional, interpretable policy classes where discretization is natural. We evaluate OFS on (i) a synthetic closed-loop benchmark with stable contraction dynamics and (ii) two semi-synthetic closed-loop benchmarks grounded in German Credit and COMPAS, constructed by training a score model and feeding group-dependent acceptance decisions back into population composition. Across all environments, OFS achieves higher reward with smaller cumulative constraint violation than unconstrained and primal-dual bandit baselines, and is near-oracle relative to the best feasible fixed threshold under the same sweep procedure. Experiments are reproducible and organized with double-blind-friendly relative outputs.",

First, a cross-model attention mechanism enables successor models to access and fuse hidden states from predecessors, facilitating hierarchical error correction and knowledge transfer. Second, a chain training paradigm progressively fine-tunes connected models with an error-suppression objective, ensuring that each model rectifies the mispredictions of its predecessor with minimal additional computation. Third, a near-parallel inference paradigm design pipelines hidden states across models layer by layer, achieving inference efficiency approaching single-model decoding. We further establish the theoretical foundations of LLMBoost, proving that sequential integration guarantees monotonic improvements under bounded correction assumptions. Extensive experiments on commonsense reasoning and arithmetic reasoning tasks demonstrate that LLMBoost consistently boosts accuracy while reducing inference latency.",

While conventional PD models prioritize predictive accuracy during model development with complex machine learning algorithms, they often overlook continuous adaptation to changing borrower behaviour, resulting in static models that degrade over time in production and generate inaccurate default predictions. Many financial institutes also find it difficult transitioning ML models from development environment to production and maintaining their health. With PDx we aimed to addresses these limitations using a dynamic, end-to-end model lifecycle management approach that integrates continuous model monitoring, retraining, and validation through a robust MLOps pipeline. We introduced a dynamic champion-challenger framework for PDx to regularly update baseline models to recalibrate independent parameters with the latest data and select the best-performing model through out-of-time validation, ensuring resilience against data drift and changing credit risk patterns. Our empirical analysis shows that decision tree-based ensemble models consistently outperform others in classifying defaulters but require frequent updates to sustain performance. Linear models (e.g., logistic regression) and neural networks exhibit greater performance degradation. The study demonstrate with PDx we can mitigates value erosion for digital lenders, particularly in short-term, small-ticket loans, where borrower behavior shifts rapidly. We have validated the effectiveness of PDx using datasets from peer-to-peer lending, business loans, and auto loans, demonstrating its scalability and adaptability for modern credit risk forecasting.",

This paper investigates the potential of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) to address these limitations through a novel Hybrid Quantum-Classical Mixture of Experts (QMoE) architecture. Specifically, we conduct an ablation study using a Quantum Gating Network (Router) combined with classical experts to isolate the source of quantum advantage. Our central finding validates the Interference Hypothesis: by leveraging quantum feature maps (Angle Embedding) and wave interference, the Quantum Router acts as a high-dimensional kernel method, enabling the modeling of complex, non-linear decision boundaries with superior parameter efficiency compared to its classical counterparts. Experimental results on non-linearly separable data, such as the Two Moons dataset, demonstrate that the Quantum Router achieves a significant topological advantage, effectively \"untangling\" data distributions that linear classical routers fail to separate efficiently. Furthermore, we analyze the architecture's robustness against simulated quantum noise, confirming its feasibility for near-term intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. We discuss practical applications in federated learning, privacy-preserving machine learning, and adaptive systems that could benefit from this quantum-enhanced routing paradigm.",

        "summary": "Graph anomaly detection technology has broad applications in financial fraud and risk control. However, existing graph anomaly detection methods often face significant challenges when dealing with complex and variable abnormal patterns, as anomalous nodes are often disguised and mixed with normal nodes, leading to the coexistence of homophily and heterophily in the graph domain. Recent spectral graph neural networks have made notable progress in addressing this issue; however, current techniques typically employ fixed, globally shared filters. This 'one-size-fits-all' approach can easily cause over-smoothing, erasing critical high-frequency signals needed for fraud detection, and lacks adaptive capabilities for different graph instances. To solve this problem, we propose a Multi-Head Spectral-Adaptive Graph Neural Network (MHSA-GNN). The core innovation is the design of a lightweight hypernetwork that, conditioned on a 'spectral fingerprint' containing structural statistics and Rayleigh quotient features, dynamically generates Chebyshev filter parameters tailored to each instance. This enables a customized filtering strategy for each node and its local subgraph. Additionally, to prevent mode collapse in the multi-head mechanism, we introduce a novel dual regularization strategy that combines teacher-student contrastive learning (TSC) to ensure representation accuracy and Barlow Twins diversity loss (BTD) to enforce orthogonality among heads. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that our method effectively preserves high-frequency abnormal signals and significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, especially showing excellent robustness on highly heterogeneous datasets.",

Standard tools often miss what is happening because worker responses to algorithmic systems are rarely linear. We use a Double Machine Learning framework to estimate a moderated mediation model without imposing restrictive functional forms. Using survey data from 464 gig workers, we find a clear nonmonotonic pattern. Supportive HR practices improve worker wellbeing, but their link to performance weakens in a murky middle where algorithmic oversight is present yet hard to interpret. The relationship strengthens again when oversight is transparent and explainable. These results show why simple linear specifications can miss the pattern and sometimes suggest the opposite conclusion. For platform design, the message is practical: control that is only partly defined creates confusion, but clear rules and credible recourse can make strong oversight workable.

        "summary": "Recently, Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have shown promising potential across vision, language, and cross-modal generation. However, a notable discrepancy exists between their training and inference procedures. In particular, MDM inference is a multi-step, iterative process governed not only by the model itself but also by various schedules that dictate the token-decoding trajectory (e.g., how many tokens to decode at each step). In contrast, MDMs are typically trained using a simplified, single-step BERT-style objective that masks a subset of tokens and predicts all of them simultaneously. This step-level simplification fundamentally disconnects the training paradigm from the trajectory-level nature of inference, leaving the inference schedules never optimized during training. In this paper, we introduce Co-GRPO, which reformulates MDM generation as a unified Markov Decision Process (MDP) that jointly incorporates both the model and the inference schedule. By applying Group Relative Policy Optimization at the trajectory level, Co-GRPO cooperatively optimizes model parameters and schedule parameters under a shared reward, without requiring costly backpropagation through the multi-step generation process. This holistic optimization aligns training with inference more thoroughly and substantially improves generation quality. Empirical results across four benchmarks-ImageReward, HPS, GenEval, and DPG-Bench-demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

Recent GAN-based methods have demonstrated the feasibility of synthesizing load patterns, but most existing approaches treat all devices uniformly within a single model, neglecting the behavioral differences between intermittent and continuous appliances and resulting in unstable training and limited output fidelity. To address these limitations, we propose the Cluster Aggregated GAN framework, a hybrid generative approach that routes each appliance to a specialized branch based on its behavioral characteristics. For intermittent appliances, a clustering module groups similar activation patterns and allocates dedicated generators for each cluster, ensuring that both common and rare operational modes receive adequate modeling capacity. Continuous appliances follow a separate branch that employs an LSTM-based generator to capture gradual temporal evolution while maintaining training stability through sequence compression. Extensive experiments on the UVIC smart plug dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms baseline methods across metrics measuring realism, diversity, and training stability, and that integrating clustering as an active generative component substantially improves both interpretability and scalability. These findings establish the proposed framework as an effective approach for synthetic load generation in non-intrusive load monitoring research.",

While effective for approximate similarity search, this design introduces fundamental non-determinism: identical models, inputs, and code can produce different memory states and retrieval results across hardware architectures (e.g., x86 vs. ARM). This prevents replayability and safe deployment, leading to silent data divergence that prevents post-hoc verification and compromises audit trails in regulated sectors. We present Valori, a deterministic AI memory substrate that replaces floating-point memory operations with fixed-point arithmetic (Q16.16) and models memory as a replayable state machine.

We demonstrate that non-determinism arises before indexing or retrieval and show how Valori enforces determinism at the memory boundary.

        "summary": "The widespread application of Large Language Models (LLMs) has motivated a growing interest in their capacity for processing dynamic graphs. Temporal motifs, as an elementary unit and important local property of dynamic graphs which can directly reflect anomalies and unique phenomena, are essential for understanding their evolutionary dynamics and structural features. However, leveraging LLMs for temporal motif analysis on dynamic graphs remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we systematically study LLM performance on temporal motif-related tasks. Specifically, we propose a comprehensive benchmark, LLMTM (Large Language Models in Temporal Motifs), which includes six tailored tasks across nine temporal motif types. We then conduct extensive experiments to analyze the impacts of different prompting techniques and LLMs (including nine models: openPangu-7B, the DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen series, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-R1, and o3) on model performance. Informed by our benchmark findings, we develop a tool-augmented LLM agent that leverages precisely engineered prompts to solve these tasks with high accuracy. Nevertheless, the high accuracy of the agent incurs a substantial cost. To address this trade-off, we propose a simple yet effective structure-aware dispatcher that considers both the dynamic graph's structural properties and the LLM's cognitive load to intelligently dispatch queries between the standard LLM prompting and the more powerful agent. Our experiments demonstrate that the structure-aware dispatcher effectively maintains high accuracy while reducing cost.",

However, current state of the art PNN simulation tools face significant scalability challenges when training large-scale PNNs, due to the computational demands of transfer matrix calculations, resulting in high memory and time consumption. To overcome these limitations, we introduce the Slicing method, an efficient transfer matrix computation approach compatible with back-propagation. We integrate this method into LuxIA, a unified simulation and training framework. The Slicing method substantially reduces memory usage and execution time, enabling scalable simulation and training of large PNNs. Experimental evaluations across various photonic architectures and standard datasets, including MNIST, Digits, and Olivetti Faces, show that LuxIA consistently surpasses existing tools in speed and scalability. Our results advance the state of the art in PNN simulation, making it feasible to explore and optimize larger, more complex architectures.

        "summary": "Physics-constrained data generation is essential for machine learning in scientific domains where real data are scarce; however, existing approaches often over-constrain models without identifying which physical components are necessary. We present a systematic ablation study of a physics-informed grating coupler spectrum generator that maps five geometric parameters to 100-point spectral responses. By selectively removing explicit energy conservation enforcement, Fabry-Perot oscillations, bandwidth variation, and noise, we uncover a physics constraint paradox: explicit energy conservation enforcement is mathematically redundant when the underlying equations are physically consistent, with constrained and unconstrained variants achieving identical conservation accuracy (mean error approximately 7 x 10^-9). In contrast, Fabry-Perot oscillations dominate threshold-based bandwidth variability, accounting for a 72 percent reduction in half-maximum bandwidth spread when removed (with bandwidth spread reduced from 132.3 nm to 37.4 nm). We further identify a subtle pitfall: standard noise-addition-plus-renormalization pipelines introduce 0.5 percent unphysical negative absorption values. The generator operates at 200 samples per second, enabling high-throughput data generation and remaining orders of magnitude faster than typical full-wave solvers reported in the literature. Finally, downstream machine learning evaluation reveals a clear physics-learnability trade-off: while central wavelength prediction remains unaffected, removing Fabry-Perot oscillations improves bandwidth prediction accuracy by 31.3 percent in R-squared and reduces RMSE by 73.8 percent. These findings provide actionable guidance for physics-informed dataset design and highlight machine learning performance as a diagnostic tool for assessing constraint relevance.",

The aim of the study was to develop a predictive model for assessing the risk of cardiac death based on the real and synthetic data of patients undergoing PCI and to identify the factors that have the greatest impact on mortality. We analyzed 2,044 patients, who underwent a PCI for bifurcation lesions. The primary outcome was cardiac death at 3-year follow-up. Several machine learning models were applied to predict three-year mortality after PCI. To address class imbalance and improve the representation of the minority class, an additional 500 synthetic samples were generated and added to the training set. To evaluate the contribution of individual features to model performance, we applied permutation feature importance. An additional experiment was conducted to evaluate how the model's predictions would change after removing non-informative features from the training and test datasets. Without oversampling, all models achieve high overall accuracy (0.92-0.93), yet they almost completely ignore the minority class. Across models, augmentation consistently increases minority-class recall with minimal loss of AUROC, improves probability quality, and yields more clinically reasonable risk estimates on the constructed severe profiles. According to feature importance analysis, four features emerged as the most influential: Age, Ejection Fraction, Peripheral Artery Disease, and Cerebrovascular Disease. These results show that straightforward augmentation with realistic and extreme cases can expose, quantify, and reduce brittleness in imbalanced clinical prediction using only tabular records, and motivate routine reporting of probability quality and stress tests alongside headline metrics.",

        "summary": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have brought revolutionary advancements to the field of link prediction (LP), providing powerful tools for mining potential relationships in graphs. However, existing methods face challenges when dealing with large-scale sparse graphs and the need for a high degree of alignment between different datasets in transfer learning. Besides, although self-supervised methods have achieved remarkable success in many graph tasks, prior research has overlooked the potential of transfer learning to generalize across different graph datasets. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Graph Attention Adaptive Transfer Network (GAATNet). It combines the advantages of pre-training and fine-tuning to capture global node embedding information across datasets of different scales, ensuring efficient knowledge transfer and improved LP performance. To enhance the model's generalization ability and accelerate training, we design two key strategies: 1) Incorporate distant neighbor embeddings as biases in the self-attention module to capture global features. 2) Introduce a lightweight self-adapter module during fine-tuning to improve training efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that GAATNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in LP tasks. This study provides a general and scalable solution for LP tasks to effectively integrate GNNs with transfer learning.

While prior deep learning frameworks have integrated multimodal embeddings into biomedical knowledge graphs (BKGs) and further improved these representations through graph neural network message-passing paradigms, these models have been applied to tasks such as link prediction and binary drug-disease association, rather than the task of gene perturbation, which may unveil more about mechanistic transcriptomic effects. To address this gap, we construct a merged biomedical graph that integrates (i) PrimeKG++, an augmentation of PrimeKG containing semantically rich embeddings for nodes with (ii) LINCS L1000 drug and cell line nodes, initialized with multimodal embeddings from foundation models such as MolFormerXL and BioBERT. Using this heterogeneous graph, we train a graph attention network (GAT) with a downstream prediction head that learns the delta expression profile of over 978 landmark genes for a given drug-cell pair. Our results show that our framework outperforms MLP baselines for differentially expressed genes (DEG) -- which predict the delta expression given a concatenated embedding of drug features, target features, and baseline cell expression -- under the scaffold and random splits. Ablation experiments with edge shuffling and node feature randomization further demonstrate that the edges provided by biomedical KGs enhance perturbation-level prediction. More broadly, our framework provides a path toward mechanistic drug modeling: moving beyond binary drug-disease association tasks to granular transcriptional effects of therapeutic intervention.",

However, traditional methods overlook the role of temporal semantic exploration in HMS. This paper explores the use of temporal vision semantics (TVS) derived from human motion sequences, leveraging the image-to-text capabilities of a large language model (LLM) to enhance subspace clustering performance. The core idea is to extract textual motion information from consecutive frames via LLM and incorporate this learned information into the subspace clustering framework. The primary challenge lies in learning TVS from human motion sequences using LLM and integrating this information into subspace clustering. To address this, we determine whether consecutive frames depict the same motion by querying the LLM and subsequently learn temporal neighboring information based on its response. We then develop a TVS-integrated subspace clustering approach, incorporating subspace embedding with a temporal regularizer that induces each frame to share similar subspace embeddings with its temporal neighbors. Additionally, segmentation is performed based on subspace embedding with a temporal constraint that induces the grouping of each frame with its temporal neighbors. We also introduce a feedback-enabled framework that continuously optimizes subspace embedding based on the segmentation output. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches on four benchmark human motion datasets.",

Our method learns to invert the forward physics model, directly predicting drag coefficient and thrust correction factor from a single apogee measurement combined with motor and configuration features. In this proof-of-concept study, we train on 10,000 synthetic flights and evaluate on 8 real flights, achieving a mean absolute error of 12.3 m in apogee prediction - demonstrating promising sim-to-real transfer with zero real training examples. Analysis reveals a systematic positive bias in predictions, providing quantitative insight into the gap between idealized physics and real-world flight conditions.

        "summary": "A systematic mismatch exists between mathematically ideal and effective activation updates during gradient descent. As intended, parameters update in their direction of steepest descent. However, activations are argued to constitute a more directly impactful quantity to prioritise in optimisation, as they are closer to the loss in the computational graph and carry sample-dependent information through the network. Yet their propagated updates do not take the optimal steepest-descent step. These quantities exhibit non-ideal sample-wise scaling across affine, convolutional, and attention layers. Solutions to correct for this are trivial and, entirely incidentally, derive normalisation from first principles despite motivational independence. Consequently, such considerations offer a fresh and conceptual reframe of normalisation's action, with auxiliary experiments bolstering this mechanistically. Moreover, this analysis makes clear a second possibility: a solution that is functionally distinct from modern normalisations, without scale-invariance, yet remains empirically successful, outperforming conventional normalisers across several tests. This is presented as an alternative to the affine map. This generalises to convolution via a new functional form, \"PatchNorm\", a compositionally inseparable normaliser. Together, these provide an alternative mechanistic framework that adds to, and counters some of, the discussion of normalisation. Further, it is argued that normalisers are better decomposed into activation-function-like maps with parameterised scaling, thereby aiding the prioritisation of representations during optimisation. Overall, this constitutes a theoretical-principled approach that yields several new functions that are empirically validated and raises questions about the affine + nonlinear approach to model creation.",

Screening high-risk individuals with annual low-dose CT (LDCT) can support earlier detection and reduce deaths, but widespread implementation may strain the already limited radiology workforce. AI models have shown potential in estimating lung cancer risk from LDCT scans. However, high-risk populations for lung cancer are diverse, and these models' performance across demographic groups remains an open question. In this study, we drew on the considerations on confounding factors and ethically significant biases outlined in the JustEFAB framework to evaluate potential performance disparities and fairness in two deep learning risk estimation models for lung cancer screening: the Sybil lung cancer risk model and the Venkadesh21 nodule risk estimator. We also examined disparities in the PanCan2b logistic regression model recommended in the British Thoracic Society nodule management guideline. Both deep learning models were trained on data from the US-based National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), and assessed on a held-out NLST validation set. We evaluated AUROC, sensitivity, and specificity across demographic subgroups, and explored potential confounding from clinical risk factors. We observed a statistically significant AUROC difference in Sybil's performance between women (0.88, 95% CI: 0.86, 0.90) and men (0.81, 95% CI: 0.78, 0.84, p < .001).

These differences were not explained by available clinical confounders and thus may be classified as unfair biases according to JustEFAB.

The proposed framework is performed using multiple experimental datasets compiled from peer-reviewed literature and in-house experiments and evaluated across powder-fed, wire-fed, and hybrid wire-powder L-DED processes. Results show that both MAML and Reptile achieve accurate bead height predictions on unseen target tasks using as few as three to nine training examples, consistently outperforming conventional feedforward neural networks trained under comparable data constraints. Across multiple target tasks representing different printing conditions, the meta-learning models achieve strong generalization performance, with R-squared values reaching up to approximately 0.9 and mean absolute errors between 0.03-0.08 mm, demonstrating effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous L-DED settings.",

        "summary": "Machine learning models are primarily judged by predictive performance, especially in applied settings. Once a model reaches high accuracy, its explanation is often assumed to be correct and trustworthy. However, this assumption raises an overlooked question: when two models achieve high accuracy, do they rely on the same internal logic, or do they reach the same outcome via different -- and potentially competing -- mechanisms? We introduce EvoXplain, a diagnostic framework that measures the stability of model explanations across repeated training. Rather than analysing a single trained model, EvoXplain treats explanations as samples drawn from the stochastic optimisation process itself -- without aggregating predictions or constructing ensembles -- and examines whether these samples form a single coherent explanation or separate into multiple, distinct explanatory modes. We evaluate EvoXplain on the Breast Cancer and COMPAS datasets using two widely deployed model classes: Logistic Regression and Random Forests. Although all models achieve high predictive accuracy, their explanations frequently exhibit clear multimodality. Even models commonly assumed to be stable, such as Logistic Regression, can produce multiple well-separated explanatory basins under repeated training on the same data split. These differences are not explained by hyperparameter variation or simple performance trade-offs. EvoXplain does not attempt to select a 'correct' explanation. Instead, it makes explanatory instability visible and quantifiable, revealing when single-instance or averaged explanations obscure the existence of multiple underlying mechanisms. More broadly, EvoXplain reframes interpretability as a property of a model class under repeated instantiation, rather than of any single trained model.",

        "summary": "Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) have recently achieved remarkable multimodal understanding, but their massive size makes them impractical for deployment on mobile or edge devices. This raises the need for compact yet capable VLMs that can efficiently learn from powerful large teachers. However, distilling knowledge from a large teacher to a small student remains challenging due to their large size gap: the student often fails to reproduce the teacher's complex, high-dimensional representations, leading to unstable learning and degraded performance. To address this, we propose Masters (Masking Teacher and Reinforcing Student), a mask-progressive reinforcement learning (RL) distillation framework. Masters first masks non-dominant weights of the teacher to reduce unnecessary complexity, then progressively restores the teacher by gradually increasing its capacity during training. This strategy allows the student to learn richer representations from the teacher in a smooth and stable manner. To further refine knowledge transfer, Masters integrates an offline RL stage with two complementary rewards: an accuracy reward that measures the correctness of the generated responses, and a distillation reward that quantifies the ease of transferring responses from teacher to student. Unlike online think-answer RL paradigms that are computationally expensive and generate lengthy responses, our offline RL leverages pre-generated responses from masked teachers. These provide rich yet efficient guidance, enabling students to achieve strong performance without requiring the think-answer process.",

To address this, we introduce DiRL, an efficient post-training framework that tightly integrates FlexAttention-accelerated blockwise training with LMDeploy-optimized inference. This architecture enables a streamlined online model update loop, facilitating efficient two-stage post-training (Supervised Fine-Tuning followed by Reinforcement Learning). Building on this framework, we propose DiPO, the first unbiased Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) implementation tailored for dLLMs. We validate our approach by training DiRL-8B-Instruct on high-quality math data.

The pipeline features metadata-based filtering, MMR sampling, a two-stage cross-encoder reranking mechanism, and an abstention mechanism to reduce hallucinations and ensure grounded reasoning. Evaluated on ICMP ping flood and TCP SYN flood traces from the real-world traffic dataset, it demonstrates robust performance, achieving accuracy between 95.95% and 98.82% across different attack types and evaluation benchmarks. These results are validated against two complementary sources: dataset ground truth and human expert assessments. ReGAIN also outperforms rule-based, classical ML, and deep learning baselines while providing unique explainability through trustworthy, verifiable responses.",

        "summary": "Standard neural network architectures employ fixed activation functions (ReLU, tanh, sigmoid) that are poorly suited for approximating functions with singular or fractional power behavior, a structure that arises ubiquitously in physics, including boundary layers, fracture mechanics, and corner singularities. We introduce Müntz-Szász Networks (MSN), a novel architecture that replaces fixed smooth activations with learnable fractional power bases grounded in classical approximation theory. Each MSN edge computes $φ(x) = \\sum_k a_k |x|^{μ_k} + \\sum_k b_k \\mathrm{sign}(x)|x|^{λ_k}$, where the exponents $\\{μ_k, λ_k\\}$ are learned alongside the coefficients. We prove that MSN inherits universal approximation from the Müntz-Szász theorem and establish novel approximation rates: for functions of the form $|x|^α$, MSN achieves error $\\mathcal{O}(|μ- α|^2)$ with a single learned exponent, whereas standard MLPs require $\\mathcal{O}(ε^{-1/α})$ neurons for comparable accuracy. On supervised regression with singular target functions, MSN achieves 5-8x lower error than MLPs with 10x fewer parameters. Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) represent a particularly demanding application for singular function approximation; on PINN benchmarks including a singular ODE and stiff boundary-layer problems, MSN achieves 3-6x improvement while learning interpretable exponents that match the known solution structure.

Our method assigns labels using a confidence-ordered greedy procedure driven by an additive scoring function that integrates class priors, neighborhood statistics, feature similarity, and training-derived label-label compatibility. A small set of transparent hyperparameters controls the relative influence of these components, enabling smooth adaptation between homophilic and heterophilic regimes. We further introduce a validation-gated hybrid strategy in which combinatorial predictions are optionally injected as priors into a lightweight neural model. Hybrid refinement is applied only when it improves validation performance, preserving interpretability when neuralization is unnecessary. All adaptation signals are computed strictly from training data, ensuring a leakage-free evaluation protocol.

Transformer itself tries to solve this problem by implementing multi-head attentions, yet the number of heads is limited by complexity. I propose a method to decide a value for each query dynamically, which could cut down all the redundant heads, keeping only one. Consequently, the following feed forward network could be cut down entirely, as each revised embedding has already fetched enough useful values far beyond the context. As a result, a single-head Dynamic Value Attention (DVA) is all you need in a transformer. According to the experiment, DVA may save 37.6% training time than the original transformer meanwhile increasing the learning capability.",

        "summary": "The ruling method in modern Artificial Intelligence spanning from Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to Large Language Models (LLMs) relies on a surge of static, externally defined reward functions. While this \"extrinsic maximization\" approach has rendered superhuman performance in closed, stationary fields, it produces agents that are fragile in open-ended, real-world environments. Standard agents lack internal autonomy: they struggle to explore without dense feedback, fail to adapt to distribution shifts (non-stationarity), and require extensive manual tuning of static hyperparameters. This paper proposes that the unaddressed factor in robust autonomy is a functional analog to biological emotion, serving as a high-level homeostatic control mechanism. We introduce Emotion-Inspired Learning Signals (EILS), a unified framework that replaces scattered optimization heuristics with a coherent, bio-inspired internal feedback engine. Unlike traditional methods that treat emotions as semantic labels, EILS models them as continuous, homeostatic appraisal signals such as Curiosity, Stress, and Confidence. We formalize these signals as vector-valued internal states derived from interaction history. These states dynamically modulate the agent's optimization landscape in real time: curiosity regulates entropy to prevent mode collapse, stress modulates plasticity to overcome inactivity, and confidence adapts trust regions to stabilize convergence. We hypothesize that this closed-loop homeostatic regulation can enable EILS agents to outperform standard baselines in terms of sample efficiency and non-stationary adaptation.",

By addressing the aliasing issue in small kernels (e.g., 3x3) through discrete radial profiling, our empirical results on ResNet-18 and CIFAR-10 demonstrate that L2 regularization suppresses high-frequency energy accumulation by over 3x compared to unregularized baselines. Furthermore, we reveal a critical Accuracy-Robustness Trade-off: while L2 models are sensitive to broadband Gaussian noise due to over-specialization in low frequencies, they exhibit superior robustness against high-frequency information loss (e.g., low resolution), outperforming baselines by >6% in blurred scenarios. This work provides a signal-processing perspective on generalization, confirming that regularization enforces a strong spectral inductive bias towards low-frequency structures.",

        "summary": "Tennis strategy optimization is a challenging sequential decision-making problem involving hierarchical scoring, stochastic outcomes, long-horizon credit assignment, physical fatigue, and adaptation to opponent skill. I present a reinforcement learning framework that integrates a custom tennis simulation environment with a Dueling Double Deep Q-Network(DDQN) trained using curriculum learning. The environment models complete tennis scoring at the level of points, games, and sets, rally-level tactical decisions across ten discrete action categories, symmetric fatigue dynamics, and a continuous opponent skill parameter. The dueling architecture decomposes action-value estimation into state-value and advantage components, while double Q-learning reduces overestimation bias and improves training stability in this long-horizon stochastic domain. Curriculum learning progressively increases opponent difficulty from 0.40 to 0.50, enabling robust skill acquisition without the training collapse observed under fixed opponents. Across extensive evaluations, the trained agent achieves win rates between 98 and 100 percent against balanced opponents and maintains strong performance against more challenging opponents. Serve efficiency ranges from 63.0 to 67.5 percent, and return efficiency ranges from 52.8 to 57.1 percent. Ablation studies demonstrate that both the dueling architecture and curriculum learning are necessary for stable convergence, while a standard DQN baseline fails to learn effective policies. Despite strong performance, tactical analysis reveals a pronounced defensive bias, with the learned policy prioritizing error avoidance and prolonged rallies over aggressive point construction. These results highlight a limitation of win-rate driven optimization in simplified sports simulations and emphasize the importance of reward design for realistic sports reinforcement learning.",

        "summary": "A fundamental limitation of supervised deep learning in high-dimensional tabular domains is \"Generalization Collapse\": models learn precise decision boundaries for known distributions but fail catastrophically when facing Out-of-Distribution (OOD) data. We hypothesize that this failure stems from the lack of topological constraints in the latent space, resulting in diffuse manifolds where novel anomalies remain statistically indistinguishable from benign data. To address this, we propose Latent Sculpting, a hierarchical two-stage representation learning framework. Stage 1 utilizes a hybrid 1D-CNN and Transformer Encoder trained with a novel Dual-Centroid Compactness Loss (DCCL) to actively \"sculpt\" benign traffic into a low-entropy, hyperspherical cluster. Unlike standard contrastive losses that rely on triplet mining, DCCL optimizes global cluster centroids to enforce absolute manifold density. Stage 2 conditions a Masked Autoregressive Flow (MAF) on this pre-structured manifold to learn an exact density estimate. We evaluate this methodology on the rigorous CIC-IDS-2017 benchmark, treating it as a proxy for complex, non-stationary data streams. Empirical results demonstrate that explicit manifold sculpting is a prerequisite for robust zero-shot generalization. While supervised baselines suffered catastrophic performance collapse on unseen distribution shifts (F1 approx 0.30) and the strongest unsupervised baseline achieved only 0.76, our framework achieved an F1-Score of 0.87 on strictly zero-shot anomalies. Notably, we report an 88.89% detection rate on \"Infiltration\" scenarios--a complex distributional shift where state-of-the-art supervised models achieved 0.00% accuracy. These findings suggest that decoupling structure learning from density estimation provides a scalable path toward generalized anomaly detection.",

In this paper, we propose TIDES (Traffic Intelligence with DeepSeek-Enhanced Spatial-temporal prediction), a novel LLM-based framework that captures spatial-temporal correlations for urban wireless traffic prediction. TIDES first identifies heterogeneous traffic patterns across regions through a clustering mechanism and trains personalized models for each region to balance generalization and specialization. To bridge the domain gap between numerical traffic data and language-based models, we introduce a prompt engineering scheme that embeds statistical traffic features as structured inputs. Furthermore, we design a DeepSeek module that enables spatial alignment via cross-domain attention, allowing the LLM to leverage information from spatially related regions. By fine-tuning only lightweight components while freezing core LLM layers, TIDES achieves efficient adaptation to domain-specific patterns without incurring excessive training overhead. Extensive experiments on real-world cellular traffic datasets demonstrate that TIDES significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and robustness.

Developing effective Reward Models (RMs) for this process faces significant methodological hurdles. Current data collection paradigms, reliant on in-prompt pairwise annotations, suffer from labeling noise. Concurrently, the architectural design of VLM-based RMs, particularly their output mechanisms, remains underexplored. Furthermore, RM is susceptible to reward hacking in post-training. To mitigate these limitations, we propose SoliReward, a systematic framework for video RM training. Our framework first sources high-quality, cost-efficient data via single-item binary annotations, then constructs preference pairs using a cross-prompt pairing strategy. Architecturally, we employ a Hierarchical Progressive Query Attention mechanism to enhance feature aggregation. Finally, we introduce a modified BT loss that explicitly accommodates win-tie scenarios. This approach regularizes the RM's score distribution for positive samples, providing more nuanced preference signals to alleviate over-focus on a small number of top-scoring samples.

A central challenge is identifiability: as established in disentangled representation learning and nonlinear ICA literature, disentangling causal variables from observational data is impossible without supervision, auxiliary signals, or strong inductive biases. In this work, we propose the Latent Additive Noise Model Causal Autoencoder (LANCA) to operationalize the Additive Noise Model (ANM) as a strong inductive bias for unsupervised discovery. Theoretically, we prove that while the ANM constraint does not guarantee unique identifiability in the general mixing case, it resolves component-wise indeterminacy by restricting the admissible transformations from arbitrary diffeomorphisms to the affine class. Methodologically, arguing that the stochastic encoding inherent to VAEs obscures the structural residuals required for latent causal discovery, LANCA employs a deterministic Wasserstein Auto-Encoder (WAE) coupled with a differentiable ANM Layer. This architecture transforms residual independence from a passive assumption into an explicit optimization objective. Empirically, LANCA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on synthetic physics benchmarks (Pendulum, Flow), and on photorealistic environments (CANDLE), where it demonstrates superior robustness to spurious correlations arising from complex background scenes.",

        "summary": "We introduce Iterated Bellman Calibration, a simple, model-agnostic, post-hoc procedure for calibrating off-policy value predictions in infinite-horizon Markov decision processes. Bellman calibration requires that states with similar predicted long-term returns exhibit one-step returns consistent with the Bellman equation under the target policy. We adapt classical histogram and isotonic calibration to the dynamic, counterfactual setting by repeatedly regressing fitted Bellman targets onto a model's predictions, using a doubly robust pseudo-outcome to handle off-policy data. This yields a one-dimensional fitted value iteration scheme that can be applied to any value estimator. Our analysis provides finite-sample guarantees for both calibration and prediction under weak assumptions, and critically, without requiring Bellman completeness or realizability.",

A sequence of $α$-level quantile forecasts is calibrated if the forecasts are larger than the target value at an $α$-fraction of time steps. We introduce a lightweight method called Multi-Level Quantile Tracker (MultiQT) that wraps around any existing point or quantile forecaster to produce corrected forecasts guaranteed to achieve calibration, even against adversarial distribution shifts, while ensuring that the forecasts are ordered -- e.g., the 0.5-level quantile forecast is never larger than the 0.6-level forecast. Furthermore, the method comes with a no-regret guarantee that implies it will not worsen the performance of an existing forecaster, asymptotically, with respect to the quantile loss. In experiments, we find that MultiQT significantly improves the calibration of real forecasters in epidemic and energy forecasting problems.",

        "summary": "One-to-one tutoring is widely considered the gold standard for personalized education, yet it remains prohibitively expensive to scale. To evaluate whether generative AI might help expand access to this resource, we conducted an exploratory randomized controlled trial (RCT) with $N = 165$ students across five UK secondary schools. We integrated LearnLM -- a generative AI model fine-tuned for pedagogy -- into chat-based tutoring sessions on the Eedi mathematics platform. In the RCT, expert tutors directly supervised LearnLM, with the remit to revise each message it drafted until they would be satisfied sending it themselves. LearnLM proved to be a reliable source of pedagogical instruction, with supervising tutors approving 76.4% of its drafted messages making zero or minimal edits (i.e., changing only one or two characters). This translated into effective tutoring support: students guided by LearnLM performed at least as well as students chatting with human tutors on each learning outcome we measured. In fact, students who received support from LearnLM were 5.5 percentage points more likely to solve novel problems on subsequent topics (with a success rate of 66.2%) than those who received tutoring from human tutors alone (rate of 60.7%). In interviews, tutors highlighted LearnLM's strength at drafting Socratic questions that encouraged deeper reflection from students, with multiple tutors even reporting that they learned new pedagogical practices from the model. Overall, our results suggest that pedagogically fine-tuned AI tutoring systems may play a promising role in delivering effective, individualized learning support at scale.",

We first apply our framework to quantify memorization in existing methods. Next, through controlled experiments with a latent vector-set (Vecset) diffusion model, we find that, on the data side, memorization depends on data modality, and increases with data diversity and finer-grained conditioning; on the modeling side, it peaks at a moderate guidance scale and can be mitigated by longer Vecsets and simple rotation augmentation. Together, our framework and analysis provide an empirical understanding of memorization in 3D generative models and suggest simple yet effective strategies to reduce it without degrading generation quality.

Recent work has extended these methods to federated settings to address data decentralization and privacy constraints, but often under idealized assumptions that all clients share the same causal model. Such assumptions are unrealistic in practice, as client-specific policies or protocols, for example, across hospitals, naturally induce heterogeneous and unknown interventions. In this work, we address federated causal discovery under unknown client-level interventions. We propose I-PERI, a novel federated algorithm that first recovers the CPDAG of the union of client graphs and then orients additional edges by exploiting structural differences induced by interventions across clients. This yields a tighter equivalence class, which we call the $\\mathbfΦ$-Markov Equivalence Class, represented by the $\\mathbfΦ$-CPDAG.

Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach balances misspecification error, estimation variance, and non-stationarity, performing close to the best model in hindsight. Applying our method to 17 industry portfolio returns, we consistently outperform standard rolling-window benchmarks, improving out-of-sample $R^2$ by 14-23% on average. During NBER- designated recessions, improvements are substantial: our method achieves positive $R^2$ during the Gulf War recession while benchmarks are negative, and improves $R^2$ in absolute terms by at least 80bps during the 2001 recession as well as superior performance during the 2008 Financial Crisis.

Our method uses geometry-driven path augmentation, guided by the geometry in the system's invariant density to reconstruct likely trajectories and infer the underlying dynamics without assuming specific parametric models. Applied to overdamped Langevin systems, our approach accurately recovers stochastic dynamics even from extremely undersampled data, outperforming existing methods in synthetic benchmarks.

Existing factor-based methods typically reduce alphas to numerical time series, overlooking the semantic rationale that determines when a factor is economically relevant. We propose Alpha-R1, an 8B-parameter reasoning model trained via reinforcement learning for context-aware alpha screening. Alpha-R1 reasons over factor logic and real-time news to evaluate alpha relevance under changing market conditions, selectively activating or deactivating factors based on contextual consistency.

In this article, we provide a systematic introduction to BD-RIS, elaborating on its functional principles concerning architectural design, promising advantages, and classification. Subsequently, we present recent advances and identify a series of challenges and opportunities. Additionally, we consider a specific case study where beamforming is designed using four different algorithms, and we analyze their performance with respect to sum rate and computation cost. To augment the beamforming capabilities in 6G BD-RIS with quantum enhancement, we analyze various hybrid quantum-classical machine learning (ML) models to improve beam prediction performance, employing real-world communication Scenario 8 from the DeepSense 6G dataset.

        "summary": "We study visual representation learning from a structural and topological perspective. We begin from a single hypothesis: that visual understanding presupposes a semantic language for vision, in which many perceptual observations correspond to a small number of discrete semantic states. Together with widely assumed premises on transferability and abstraction in representation learning, this hypothesis implies that the visual observation space must be organized in a fiber bundle like structure, where nuisance variation populates fibers and semantics correspond to a quotient base space. From this structure we derive two theoretical consequences. First, the semantic quotient $X/G$ is not a submanifold of $X$ and cannot be obtained through smooth deformation alone, semantic invariance requires a non-homeomorphic, discriminative target, for example, supervision via labels, cross instance identification, or multimodal alignment that supplies explicit semantic equivalence. Second, we show that approximating the quotient also places structural demands on the model architecture. Semantic abstraction requires not only an external semantic target, but a representation mechanism capable of supporting topology change: an expand-and-snap process in which the manifold is first geometrically expanded to separate structure and then collapsed to form discrete semantic regions. We emphasize that these results are interpretive rather than prescriptive: the framework provides a topological lens that aligns with empirical regularities observed in large-scale discriminative and multimodal models, and with classical principles in statistical learning theory.",

        "summary": "The prevailing paradigm in AI for physical systems, scaling general-purpose foundation models toward universal multimodal reasoning, confronts a fundamental barrier at the control interface. Recent benchmarks show that even frontier vision-language models achieve only 50-53% accuracy on basic quantitative physics tasks, behaving as approximate guessers that preserve semantic plausibility while violating physical constraints. This input unfaithfulness is not a scaling deficiency but a structural limitation. Perception-centric architectures optimize parameter-space imitation, whereas safety-critical control demands outcome-space guarantees over executed actions. Here, we present a fundamentally different pathway toward domain-specific foundation models by introducing compact language models operating as Agentic Physical AI, in which policy optimization is driven by physics-based validation rather than perceptual inference. We train a 360-million-parameter model on synthetic reactor control scenarios, scaling the dataset from 10^3 to 10^5 examples. This induces a sharp phase transition absent in general-purpose models. Small-scale systems exhibit high-variance imitation with catastrophic tail risk, while large-scale models undergo variance collapse exceeding 500x reduction, stabilizing execution-level behavior. Despite balanced exposure to four actuation families, the model autonomously rejects approximately 70% of the training distribution and concentrates 95% of runtime execution on a single-bank strategy. Learned representations transfer across distinct physics and continuous input modalities without architectural modification.",

However, cost optimality is fragile, as real-world implementation depends on regulatory, spatial, and stakeholder constraints that are difficult to represent in optimization models and can render cost-optimal designs infeasible. To address this limitation, we generate a diverse set of near-cost-optimal alternatives within an acceptable cost margin using Modeling to Generate Alternatives, accounting for unmodeled uncertainties. Interpretable machine learning is then applied to extract insights from the resulting solution space. The approach is applied to hydrogen import pathways considering hydrogen, ammonia, methane, and methanol as carriers. Results reveal a broad near-optimal space with great flexibility: solar, wind, and storage are not strictly required to remain within 10% of the cost optimum. Wind constraints favor solar-storage methanol pathways, while limited storage favors wind-based ammonia or methane pathways.",

        "summary": "Optimization under heavy-tailed noise has become popular recently, since it better fits many modern machine learning tasks, as captured by empirical observations. Concretely, instead of a finite second moment on gradient noise, a bounded ${\\frak p}$-th moment where ${\\frak p}\\in(1,2]$ has been recognized to be more realistic (say being upper bounded by $σ_{\\frak l}^{\\frak p}$ for some $σ_{\\frak l}\\ge0$). A simple yet effective operation, gradient clipping, is known to handle this new challenge successfully. Specifically, Clipped Stochastic Gradient Descent (Clipped SGD) guarantees a high-probability rate ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}\\ln(1/δ)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ (resp. ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}^2\\ln^2(1/δ)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$) for nonsmooth convex (resp. strongly convex) problems, where $δ\\in(0,1]$ is the failure probability and $T\\in\\mathbb{N}$ is the time horizon. In this work, we provide a refined analysis for Clipped SGD and offer two faster rates, ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}d_{\\rm eff}^{-1/2{\\frak p}}\\ln^{1-1/{\\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{1/{\\frak p}-1})$ and ${\\cal O}(σ_{\\frak l}^2d_{\\rm eff}^{-1/{\\frak p}}\\ln^{2-2/{\\frak p}}(1/δ)T^{2/{\\frak p}-2})$, than the aforementioned best results, where $d_{\\rm eff}\\ge1$ is a quantity we call the $\\textit{generalized effective dimension}$. Our analysis improves upon the existing approach on two sides: better utilization of Freedman's inequality and finer bounds for clipping error under heavy-tailed noise. In addition, we extend the refined analysis to convergence in expectation and obtain new rates that break the known lower bounds. Lastly, to complement the study, we establish new lower bounds for both high-probability and in-expectation convergence. Notably, the in-expectation lower bounds match our new upper bounds, indicating the optimality of our refined analysis for convergence in expectation.",

        "summary": "Federated unlearning has become an attractive approach to address privacy concerns in collaborative machine learning, for situations when sensitive data is remembered by AI models during the machine learning process. It enables the removal of specific data influences from trained models, aligning with the growing emphasis on the \"right to be forgotten.\" While extensively studied in horizontal federated learning, unlearning in vertical federated learning (VFL) remains challenging due to the distributed feature architecture. VFL unlearning includes sample unlearning that removes specific data points' influence and label unlearning that removes entire classes. Since different parties hold complementary features of the same samples, unlearning tasks require cross-party coordination, creating computational overhead and complexities from feature interdependencies. To address such challenges, we propose FedORA (Federated Optimization for data Removal via primal-dual Algorithm), designed for sample and label unlearning in VFL. FedORA formulates the removal of certain samples or labels as a constrained optimization problem solved using a primal-dual framework. Our approach introduces a new unlearning loss function that promotes classification uncertainty rather than misclassification. An adaptive step size enhances stability, while an asymmetric batch design, considering the prior influence of the remaining data on the model, handles unlearning and retained data differently to efficiently reduce computational costs. We provide theoretical analysis proving that the model difference between FedORA and Train-from-scratch is bounded, establishing guarantees for unlearning effectiveness. Experiments on tabular and image datasets demonstrate that FedORA achieves unlearning effectiveness and utility preservation comparable to Train-from-scratch with reduced computation and communication overhead.",

Drawing on qualitative reports in autism research that are especially salient, we propose a computational account in which paralysis arises from convergence failure in a hierarchical decision process. We separate intent selection (what to pursue) from affordance selection (how to pursue the goal) and formalize commitment as inference under a mixture of reverse- and forward-Kullback-Leibler (KL) objectives. Reverse KL is mode-seeking and promotes rapid commitment, whereas forward KL is mode-covering and preserves multiple plausible goals or actions. In static and dynamic (drift-diffusion) models, forward-KL-biased inference yields slow, heavy-tailed response times and two distinct failure modes, intent saturation and affordance saturation, when values are similar. Simulations in multi-option tasks reproduce key features of decision inertia and shutdown, treating autism as an extreme regime of a general, inference-based, decision-making continuum.",

For linear regression, this problem was solved by treating the true input values as latent variables to be estimated alongside model parameters. In this paper, we show that neural networks suffer from the same attenuation bias and that the latent variable solution generalizes directly to neural networks. We introduce LatentNN, a method that jointly optimizes network parameters and latent input values by maximizing the joint likelihood of observing both inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the correction on one-dimensional regression, multivariate inputs with correlated features, and stellar spectroscopy applications. LatentNN reduces attenuation bias across a range of signal-to-noise ratios where standard neural networks show large bias. This provides a framework for improved neural network inference in the low signal-to-noise regime characteristic of astronomical data. This bias correction is most effective when measurement errors are less than roughly half the intrinsic data range; in the regime of very low signal-to-noise and few informative features.

First, the optimal policy depends on arbitrary modeling choices (scalarization function, reference policy), yielding behavior reflecting parameterization artifacts rather than true preferences. Second, treating response generation in isolation fails to leverage comparative information in pairwise data, leaving the model's capacity for intrinsic self-reflection untapped. To address it, we propose Intrinsic Self-reflective Preference Optimization (\\q), deriving a globally optimal policy conditioning on both context and alternative responses. We prove this formulation superior to DPO/RLHF while guaranteeing invariance to scalarization and reference choices. \\q~serves as a plug-and-play enhancement without architectural changes or inference overhead. Experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in win rates and length-controlled metrics, validating that unlocking self-reflection yields more robust, human-aligned LLMs.",

Evaluations on CheXpert and NIH benchmarks reveal a fundamental tension: GRPO recovers in-distribution performance (23% improvement on CheXpert, macro-F1 = 0.346) but degrades cross-dataset transferability (19% drop on NIH). This mirrors high-resource models like NV-Reason-CXR-3B, suggesting the issue stems from the RL paradigm rather than scale. We identify a generalization paradox where the SFT checkpoint uniquely improves on NIH before optimization, indicating teacher-guided reasoning captures more institution-agnostic features. Furthermore, cross-model comparisons show structured reasoning scaffolds benefit general-purpose VLMs but offer minimal gain for medically pre-trained models. Consequently, curated supervised fine-tuning may outperform aggressive RL for clinical deployment requiring robustness across diverse populations.",

Generative artificial intelligence offers a promising approach for \\textit{de novo} molecular design but typically requires large sets of molecules to learn from. To address this problem, we present a framework combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) model to generate novel odorants from limited training sets of odor molecules. The self-supervised learning capabilities of the VAE allow it to learn SMILES grammar from ChemBL database, while its training objective is augmented with a loss term derived from an external QSAR model to structure the latent representation according to odor probability. While the VAE demonstrated high internal consistency in learning the QSAR supervision signal, validation against an external, unseen ground truth dataset (Unique Good Scents) confirms the model generates syntactically valid structures (100\\% validity achieved via rejection sampling) and 94.8\\% unique structures. The latent space is effectively structured by odor likelihood, evidenced by a Fréchet ChemNet Distance (FCD) of $\\approx$ 6.96 between generated molecules and known odorants, compared to $\\approx$ 21.6 for the ChemBL baseline. Structural analysis via Bemis-Murcko scaffolds reveals that 74.4\\% of candidates possess novel core frameworks distinct from the training data, indicating the model performs extensive chemical space exploration beyond simple derivatization of known odorants.

We show that the objective for L0 constrained stochastic minimization naturally arises from an entropy maximization problem of the stochastic gates and propose an algorithm based on federated stochastic gradient descent for distributed learning. We demonstrate that the target density (rho) of parameters can be achieved in FL, under data and client participation heterogeneity, with minimal loss in statistical performance for linear and non-linear models: Linear regression (LR), Logistic regression (LG), Softmax multi-class classification (MC), Multi-label classification with logistic units (MLC), Convolution Neural Network (CNN) for multi-class classification (MC).

        "summary": "Personalized alignment from preference data has focused primarily on improving reward model (RM) accuracy, with the implicit assumption that better preference ranking translates to better personalized behavior. However, in deployment, computational constraints necessitate inference-time adaptation via reward-guided decoding (RGD) rather than per-user policy fine-tuning. This creates a critical but overlooked requirement: reward models must not only rank preferences accurately but also effectively guide token-level generation decisions. We demonstrate that standard RM accuracy fails catastrophically as a selection criterion for deployment-ready personalized alignment. Through systematic evaluation across three datasets, we introduce policy accuracy, a metric quantifying whether RGD scoring functions correctly discriminate between preferred and dispreferred responses. We show that RM accuracy correlates only weakly with this policy-level discrimination ability (Kendall's tau = 0.08--0.31). More critically, we introduce Pref-LaMP, the first personalized alignment benchmark with ground-truth user completions, enabling direct behavioral evaluation without circular reward-based metrics. On Pref-LaMP, we expose a complete decoupling between discrimination and generation: methods with 20-point RM accuracy differences produce almost identical output quality, and even methods achieving high discrimination fail to generate behaviorally aligned responses. Finally, simple in-context learning (ICL) dominates all reward-guided methods for models > 3B parameters, achieving 3-5 point ROUGE-1 gains over the best reward method at 7B scale. These findings show that the field optimizes proxy metrics that fail to predict deployment performance and do not translate preferences into real behavioral adaptation under deployment constraints.",

Gamma replaces the single relational transformation with multiple parallel ones, including real, complex, split-complex, and dual number based transformations, each designed to model different relational structures. A relational conditioned attention fusion mechanism then adaptively fuses them at link level via a lightweight gating with entropy regularization, allowing the model to robustly emphasize the most appropriate relational bias for each triple pattern. We present a full formalization of these algebraic message functions and discuss how their combination increases expressiveness beyond any single space. Comprehensive experiments on 56 diverse knowledge graphs demonstrate that Gamma consistently outperforms Ultra in zero-shot inductive link prediction, with a 5.5% improvement in mean reciprocal rank on the inductive benchmarks and a 4.4% improvement across all benchmarks, highlighting benefits from complementary geometric representations.",

However, existing methods face two critical limitations: (1) a lack of effective mechanisms to inject multi-view information of the object into the model, leading to poor cross-view consistency, and (2) heavy reliance on fine-grained hand mesh annotations for modeling interaction occlusions. To address these challenges, we introduce ByteLoom, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based framework that generates realistic HOI videos with geometrically consistent object illustration, using simplified human conditioning and 3D object inputs. We first propose an RCM-cache mechanism that leverages Relative Coordinate Maps (RCM) as a universal representation to maintain object's geometry consistency and precisely control 6-DoF object transformations in the meantime. To compensate HOI dataset scarcity and leverage existing datasets, we further design a training curriculum that enhances model capabilities in a progressive style and relaxes the demand of hand mesh. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method faithfully preserves human identity and the object's multi-view geometry, while maintaining smooth motion and object manipulation.",

We observe data consisting of covariates, treatment assignments, and outcomes, where only the outcome corresponding to the assigned treatment is observed. The goal of policy learning is to train a policy from the observed data, where a policy is a function that recommends an optimal treatment for each individual, to maximize the policy value. In this study, we first show that maximizing the policy value is equivalent to minimizing the mean squared error for the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) under $\\{-1, 1\\}$ restricted regression models. Based on this finding, we modify the causal forest, an end-to-end CATE estimation algorithm, for policy learning. We refer to our algorithm as the causal-policy forest. Our algorithm has three advantages. First, it is a simple modification of an existing, widely used CATE estimation method, therefore, it helps bridge the gap between policy learning and CATE estimation in practice. Second, while existing studies typically estimate nuisance parameters for policy learning as a separate task, our algorithm trains the policy in a more end-to-end manner. Third, as in standard decision trees and random forests, we train the models efficiently, avoiding computational intractability.",

        "summary": "Dynamical modeling of multisite human intracranial neural recordings is essential for developing neurotechnologies such as brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). Linear dynamical models are widely used for this purpose due to their interpretability and their suitability for BCIs. In particular, these models enable flexible real-time inference, even in the presence of missing neural samples, which often occur in wireless BCIs. However, neural activity can exhibit nonlinear structure that is not captured by linear models. Furthermore, while recurrent neural network models can capture nonlinearity, their inference does not directly address handling missing observations. To address this gap, recent work introduced DFINE, a deep learning framework that integrates neural networks with linear state-space models to capture nonlinearities while enabling flexible inference. However, DFINE was developed for intracortical recordings that measure localized neuronal populations. Here we extend DFINE to modeling of multisite human intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) recordings. We find that DFINE significantly outperforms linear state-space models (LSSMs) in forecasting future neural activity. Furthermore, DFINE matches or exceeds the accuracy of a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model in neural forecasting, indicating that a linear dynamical backbone, when paired and jointly trained with nonlinear neural networks, can effectively describe the dynamics of iEEG signals while also enabling flexible inference. Additionally, DFINE handles missing observations more robustly than the baselines, demonstrating its flexible inference and utility for BCIs. Finally, DFINE's advantage over LSSM is more pronounced in high gamma spectral bands. Taken together, these findings highlight DFINE as a strong and flexible framework for modeling human iEEG dynamics, with potential applications in next-generation BCIs.",

The framework identifies reflection as the key mechanism that enables agents to adapt through interaction without back propagation or model fine tuning, thereby relaxing the conventional separation between training and deployment.To formalise this process, we introduce the Stateful Reflective Decision Process, which models reflective learning as a two stage read write interaction with episodic memory. Writing stores interaction outcomes and corresponds to policy evaluation, while reading retrieves relevant past cases and corresponds to policy improvement. We show that this process induces an equivalent Markov decision process over augmented state memory representations, allowing the use of classical tools from dynamic programming and reinforcement learning. We further instantiate the framework using entropy regularised policy iteration and establish convergence guarantees. As episodic memory grows and achieves sufficient coverage of the state space, the resulting policy converges to the optimal solution. This work provides a principled foundation for memory augmented and retrieval based language model agents capable of continual adaptation without parameter updates.",

Our method exploits the potential of continuous-depth networks in the Neural ODE paradigm with structural descriptors, widely adopted as modality-agnostic metric models which exploit self-similarities on parameterized neighborhood geometries. We propose three different variants that integrate image-based or feature-based structural descriptors and nonstructural image similarities computed by local mutual information. We conduct extensive evaluations on different experiments formed by scan dataset combinations and show surpassing qualitative and quantitative results compared to state-of-the-art baselines adequate for large or small deformations, and specific of multimodal registration.

We combine features typically used in the literature with a new set of climate indicators, including Oceanic Niño Index, Arctic Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, Outgoing Longwave Radiation, Pacific-North American pattern, Pacific Decadal Oscillation, Southern Oscillation Index, and sea surface temperatures. We compare the performance of linear regression with several machine learning algorithms, such as random forest, gradient boosting, extremely randomized trees, and extreme gradient boosting. Our results show that including climate-related variables improves predictive accuracy across all models, with extremely randomized trees achieving the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE).

Echocardiography, as a readily accessible and non-invasive imaging modality, is widely used in clinical practice to estimate LVEF. However, manual assessment of cardiac function from echocardiograms is time-consuming and subject to considerable inter-observer variability. Deep learning approaches offer a promising alternative, with the potential to achieve performance comparable to that of experienced human experts. In this study, we investigate the effectiveness of several deep learning architectures for LVEF estimation from echocardiography videos, including 3D Inception, two-stream, and CNN-RNN models. We systematically evaluate architectural modifications and fusion strategies to identify configurations that maximize prediction accuracy. Models were trained and evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset, comprising 10,030 echocardiogram videos. Our results demonstrate that modified 3D Inception architectures achieve the best overall performance, with a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 6.79%. Across architectures, we observe a tendency toward overfitting, with smaller and simpler models generally exhibiting improved generalization. Model performance was also found to be highly sensitive to hyperparameter choices, particularly convolutional kernel sizes and normalization strategies.

While automated EEG analysis has been widely studied, most existing methods target isolated diagnostic problems, particularly seizure detection, and provide limited support for multi-disorder clinical screening. This study examines automated EEG-based classification across eleven clinically relevant neurological disorder categories, encompassing acute time-critical conditions, chronic neurocognitive and developmental disorders, and disorders with indirect or weak electrophysiological signatures. EEG recordings are processed using a standard longitudinal bipolar montage and represented through a multi-domain feature set capturing temporal statistics, spectral structure, signal complexity, and inter-channel relationships. Disorder-aware machine learning models are trained under severe class imbalance, with decision thresholds explicitly calibrated to prioritize diagnostic sensitivity. Evaluation on a large, heterogeneous clinical EEG dataset demonstrates that sensitivity-oriented modeling achieves recall exceeding 80% for the majority of disorder categories, with several low-prevalence conditions showing absolute recall gains of 15-30% after threshold calibration compared to default operating points. Feature importance analysis reveals physiologically plausible patterns consistent with established clinical EEG markers. These results establish realistic performance baselines for multi-disorder EEG classification and provide quantitative evidence that sensitivity-prioritized automated analysis can support scalable EEG screening and triage in real-world clinical settings.",

This paper develops a rigorous theory of likelihood-preserving embeddings: learned representations that can replace raw data in likelihood-based workflows -- hypothesis testing, confidence interval construction, model selection -- without altering inferential conclusions. We introduce the Likelihood-Ratio Distortion metric $Δ_n$, which measures the maximum error in log-likelihood ratios induced by an embedding. Our main theoretical contribution is the Hinge Theorem, which establishes that controlling $Δ_n$ is necessary and sufficient for preserving inference. Specifically, if the distortion satisfies $Δ_n = o_p(1)$, then (i) all likelihood-ratio based tests and Bayes factors are asymptotically preserved, and (ii) surrogate maximum likelihood estimators are asymptotically equivalent to full-data MLEs. We prove an impossibility result showing that universal likelihood preservation requires essentially invertible embeddings, motivating the need for model-class-specific guarantees. We then provide a constructive framework using neural networks as approximate sufficient statistics, deriving explicit bounds connecting training loss to inferential guarantees. Experiments on Gaussian and Cauchy distributions validate the sharp phase transition predicted by exponential family theory, and applications to distributed clinical inference demonstrate practical utility.",

Instead of merely minimizing the training loss, our approach optimizes the geometry of the loss surface, guiding the model toward flatter minima that generalize better to unseen patients. We also implement a weighted sampling strategy to handle class imbalance effectively.

However, naive disaggregation introduces substantial synchronization overhead and resource underutilization due to the complex dependencies between stages. We present RollArc, a distributed system designed to maximize throughput for multi-task agentic RL on disaggregated infrastructure. RollArc is built on three core principles: (1) hardware-affinity workload mapping, which routes compute-bound and bandwidth-bound tasks to bestfit GPU devices, (2) fine-grained asynchrony, which manages execution at the trajectory level to mitigate resource bubbles, and (3) statefulness-aware computation, which offloads stateless components (e.g., reward models) to serverless infrastructure for elastic scaling. Our results demonstrate that RollArc effectively improves training throughput and achieves 1.35-2.05\\(\\times\\) end-to-end training time reduction compared to monolithic and synchronous baselines. We also evaluate RollArc by training a hundreds-of-billions-parameter MoE model for Qoder product on an Alibaba cluster with more than 3,000 GPUs, further demonstrating RollArc scalability and robustness.

        "summary": "We formulate two-party policy competition as a two-player non-cooperative game, generalizing Lin et al.'s work (2021). Each party selects a real-valued policy vector as its strategy from a compact subset of Euclidean space, and a voter's utility for a policy is given by the inner product with their preference vector. To capture the uncertainty in the competition, we assume that a policy's winning probability increases monotonically with its total utility across all voters, and we formalize this via an affine isotonic function. A player's payoff is defined as the expected utility received by its supporters. In this work, we first test and validate the isotonicity hypothesis through voting simulations. Next, we prove the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium (PSNE) in both one- and multi-dimensional settings. Although we construct a counterexample demonstrating the game's non-monotonicity, our experiments show that a decentralized gradient-based algorithm typically converges rapidly to an approximate PSNE. Finally, we present a grid-based search algorithm that finds an $ε$-approximate PSNE of the game in time polynomial in the input size and $1/ε$.",

        "summary": "RL post-training for LLMs has been widely scaled to enhance reasoning and tool-using capabilities. However, RL post-training interleaves training and inference workloads, exposing the system to faults from both sides. Existing fault tolerance frameworks for LLMs target either training or inference, leaving the optimization potential in the asynchronous execution unexplored for RL. Our key insight is role-based fault isolation so the failure in one machine does not affect the others. We treat trainer, rollout, and other management roles in RL training as distinct distributed sub-tasks. Instead of restarting the entire RL task in ByteRobust, we recover only the failed role and reconnect it to living ones, thereby eliminating the full-restart overhead including rollout replay and initialization delay. We present RobustRL, the first comprehensive robust system to handle GPU machine errors for RL post-training Effective Training Time Ratio improvement. (1) \\textit{Detect}. We implement role-aware monitoring to distinguish actual failures from role-specific behaviors to avoid the false positive and delayed detection. (2) \\textit{Restart}. For trainers, we implement a non-disruptive recovery where rollouts persist state and continue trajectory generation, while the trainer is rapidly restored via rollout warm standbys. For rollout, we perform isolated machine replacement without interrupting the RL task. (3) \\textit{Reconnect}. We replace static collective communication with dynamic, UCX-based (Unified Communication X) point-to-point communication, enabling immediate weight synchronization between recovered roles. In an RL training task on a 256-GPU cluster with Qwen3-8B-Math workload under 10\\% failure injection frequency, RobustRL can achieve an ETTR of over 80\\% compared with the 60\\% in ByteRobust and achieves 8.4\\%-17.4\\% faster in end-to-end training time.",

        "summary": "Decoding fine-grained movement from non-invasive surface Electromyography (sEMG) is a challenge for prosthetic control due to signal non-stationarity and low signal-to-noise ratios. Generic self-supervised learning (SSL) frameworks often yield suboptimal results on sEMG as they attempt to reconstruct noisy raw signals and lack the inductive bias to model the cylindrical topology of electrode arrays. To overcome these limitations, we introduce SPECTRE, a domain-specific SSL framework. SPECTRE features two primary contributions: a physiologically-grounded pre-training task and a novel positional encoding. The pre-training involves masked prediction of discrete pseudo-labels from clustered Short-Time Fourier Transform (STFT) representations, compelling the model to learn robust, physiologically relevant frequency patterns. Additionally, our Cylindrical Rotary Position Embedding (CyRoPE) factorizes embeddings along linear temporal and annular spatial dimensions, explicitly modeling the forearm sensor topology to capture muscle synergies. Evaluations on multiple datasets, including challenging data from individuals with amputation, demonstrate that SPECTRE establishes a new state-of-the-art for movement decoding, significantly outperforming both supervised baselines and generic SSL approaches. Ablation studies validate the critical roles of both spectral pre-training and CyRoPE. SPECTRE provides a robust foundation for practical myoelectric interfaces capable of handling real-world sEMG complexities.",

We provide a complete first-order analysis of how cross-entropy training reshapes attention scores and value vectors in a transformer attention head. Our core result is an \\emph{advantage-based routing law} for attention scores, \\[ \\frac{\\partial L}{\\partial s_{ij}} = α_{ij}\\bigl(b_{ij}-\\mathbb{E}_{α_i}[b]\\bigr), \\qquad b_{ij} := u_i^\\top v_j, \\] coupled with a \\emph{responsibility-weighted update} for values, \\[ Δv_j = -η\\sum_i α_{ij} u_i, \\] where $u_i$ is the upstream gradient at position $i$ and $α_{ij}$ are attention weights. These equations induce a positive feedback loop in which routing and content specialize together: queries route more strongly to values that are above-average for their error signal, and those values are pulled toward the queries that use them. We show that this coupled specialization behaves like a two-timescale EM procedure: attention weights implement an E-step (soft responsibilities), while values implement an M-step (responsibility-weighted prototype updates), with queries and keys adjusting the hypothesis frame. Through controlled simulations, including a sticky Markov-chain task where we compare a closed-form EM-style update to standard SGD, we demonstrate that the same gradient dynamics that minimize cross-entropy also sculpt the low-dimensional manifolds identified in our companion work as implementing Bayesian inference. This yields a unified picture in which optimization (gradient flow) gives rise to geometry (Bayesian manifolds), which in turn supports function (in-context probabilistic reasoning).",

Using synthetic data from pulsed impingement jet flows, we assess performance across fractional PIV sampling rates ranging from 0.5% to 10%. Evaluation metrics include reconstruction error, generalization gap, structure preservation, and uncertainty calibration. Our SVGP-KAN methods achieve reconstruction accuracy comparable to established methods, while also providing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates that reliably indicate when and where predictions degrade. The results demonstrate a robust, data-driven framework for flow field reconstruction with meaningful uncertainty quantification and offer practical guidance for experimental design in periodic flows.",

LD-DIM couples a pretrained latent diffusion prior with an end-to-end differentiable numerical solver to reconstruct unknown heterogeneous parameter fields in a low-dimensional nonlinear manifold, improving numerical conditioning and enabling stable gradient-based optimization under sparse observations. The proposed framework integrates a latent diffusion model (LDM), trained in a compact latent space, with a differentiable finite-volume discretization of the forward PDE. Sensitivities are propagated through the discretization using adjoint-based gradients combined with reverse-mode automatic differentiation. Inversion is performed directly in latent space, which implicitly suppresses ill-conditioned degrees of freedom while preserving dominant structural modes, including sharp material interfaces. The effectiveness of LD-DIM is demonstrated using a representative inverse problem for flow in porous media, where heterogeneous conductivity fields are reconstructed from spatially sparse hydraulic head measurements. Numerical experiments assess convergence behavior and reconstruction quality for both Gaussian random fields and bimaterial coefficient distributions. The results show that LD-DIM achieves consistently improved numerical stability and reconstruction accuracy of both parameter fields and corresponding PDE solutions compared with physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and physics-embedded variational autoencoder (VAE) baselines, while maintaining sharp discontinuities and reducing sensitivity to initialization.",

Building on this digital twin, we construct a multi-agent RL environment that utilizes deep Q-networks (DQN) and soft actor-critic (SAC) methods to derive adversarial false data injection (FDI) strategies capable of bypassing conventional detection mechanisms. To examine the broader grid-level consequences, a transmission and distribution (T and D) dual simulation platform is developed, allowing us to capture cascading interactions between EVCS disturbances at the distribution level and the operations of the bulk transmission system. Results demonstrate how learned attack policies disrupt load balancing and induce voltage instabilities that propagate across T and D boundaries.

Self-E learns from data similarly to a Flow Matching model, while simultaneously employing a novel self-evaluation mechanism: it evaluates its own generated samples using its current score estimates, effectively serving as a dynamic self-teacher. Unlike traditional diffusion or flow models, it does not rely solely on local supervision, which typically necessitates many inference steps. Unlike distillation-based approaches, it does not require a pretrained teacher. This combination of instantaneous local learning and self-driven global matching bridges the gap between the two paradigms, enabling the training of a high-quality text-to-image model from scratch that excels even at very low step counts. Extensive experiments on large-scale text-to-image benchmarks show that Self-E not only excels in few-step generation, but is also competitive with state-of-the-art Flow Matching models at 50 steps. We further find that its performance improves monotonically as inference steps increase, enabling both ultra-fast few-step generation and high-quality long-trajectory sampling within a single unified model.

        "summary": "Machine vision models, particularly deep neural networks, are increasingly applied to physiological signal interpretation, including electrocardiography (ECG), yet they typically require large training datasets and offer limited insight into the causal features underlying their predictions. This lack of data efficiency and interpretability constrains their clinical reliability and alignment with human reasoning. Here, we show that a perception-informed pseudo-colouring technique, previously demonstrated to enhance human ECG interpretation, can improve both explainability and few-shot learning in deep neural networks analysing complex physiological data. We focus on acquired, drug-induced long QT syndrome (LQTS) as a challenging case study characterised by heterogeneous signal morphology, variable heart rate, and scarce positive cases associated with life-threatening arrhythmias such as torsades de pointes. This setting provides a stringent test of model generalisation under extreme data scarcity. By encoding clinically salient temporal features, such as QT-interval duration, into structured colour representations, models learn discriminative and interpretable features from as few as one or five training examples. Using prototypical networks and a ResNet-18 architecture, we evaluate one-shot and few-shot learning on ECG images derived from single cardiac cycles and full 10-second rhythms. Explainability analyses show that pseudo-colouring guides attention toward clinically meaningful ECG features while suppressing irrelevant signal components. Aggregating multiple cardiac cycles further improves performance, mirroring human perceptual averaging across heartbeats. Together, these findings demonstrate that human-like perceptual encoding can bridge data efficiency, explainability, and causal reasoning in medical machine intelligence.",

This study proposes the creation of a model that allows the classification of people's emotions based on their EEG signals, for which the brain-computer interface EMOTIV EPOC was used. This allowed the collection of electroencephalographic information from 50 people, all of whom were shown audiovisual resources that helped to provoke the desired mood. The information obtained was stored in a database for the generation of the model and the corresponding classification analysis. Random Forest model was created for emotion prediction (happiness, sadness and relaxation), based on the signals of any person. The results obtained were 97.21% accurate for happiness, 76% for relaxation and 76% for sadness. Finally, the model was used to generate a real-time emotion prediction algorithm; it captures the person's EEG signals, executes the generated algorithm and displays the result on the screen with the help of images representative of each emotion.",

        "summary": "In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.",

        "summary": "Ensemble learning is traditionally justified as a variance-reduction strategy, explaining its strong performance for unstable predictors such as decision trees. This explanation, however, does not account for ensembles constructed from intrinsically stable estimators-including smoothing splines, kernel ridge regression, Gaussian process regression, and other regularized reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods whose variance is already tightly controlled by regularization and spectral shrinkage. This paper develops a general weighting theory for ensemble learning that moves beyond classical variance-reduction arguments. We formalize ensembles as linear operators acting on a hypothesis space and endow the space of weighting sequences with geometric and spectral constraints. Within this framework, we derive a refined bias-variance approximation decomposition showing how non-uniform, structured weights can outperform uniform averaging by reshaping approximation geometry and redistributing spectral complexity, even when variance reduction is negligible. Our main results provide conditions under which structured weighting provably dominates uniform ensembles, and show that optimal weights arise as solutions to constrained quadratic programs. Classical averaging, stacking, and recently proposed Fibonacci-based ensembles appear as special cases of this unified theory, which further accommodates geometric, sub-exponential, and heavy-tailed weighting laws. Overall, the work establishes a principled foundation for structure-driven ensemble learning, explaining why ensembles remain effective for smooth, low-variance base learners and setting the stage for distribution-adaptive and dynamically evolving weighting schemes developed in subsequent work.",

        "summary": "Nature rarely reveals her secrets bluntly, yet in the Fibonacci sequence she grants us a glimpse of her quiet architecture of growth, harmony, and recursive stability \\citep{Koshy2001Fibonacci, Livio2002GoldenRatio}. From spiral galaxies to the unfolding of leaves, this humble sequence reflects a universal grammar of balance. In this work, we introduce \\emph{Fibonacci Ensembles}, a mathematically principled yet philosophically inspired framework for ensemble learning that complements and extends classical aggregation schemes such as bagging, boosting, and random forests \\citep{Breiman1996Bagging, Breiman2001RandomForests, Friedman2001GBM, Zhou2012Ensemble, HastieTibshiraniFriedman2009ESL}. Two intertwined formulations unfold: (1) the use of normalized Fibonacci weights -- tempered through orthogonalization and Rao--Blackwell optimization -- to achieve systematic variance reduction among base learners, and (2) a second-order recursive ensemble dynamic that mirrors the Fibonacci flow itself, enriching representational depth beyond classical boosting. The resulting methodology is at once rigorous and poetic: a reminder that learning systems flourish when guided by the same intrinsic harmonies that shape the natural world. Through controlled one-dimensional regression experiments using both random Fourier feature ensembles \\citep{RahimiRecht2007RFF} and polynomial ensembles, we exhibit regimes in which Fibonacci weighting matches or improves upon uniform averaging and interacts in a principled way with orthogonal Rao--Blackwellization. These findings suggest that Fibonacci ensembles form a natural and interpretable design point within the broader theory of ensemble learning.",

However, traditional red-green-blue (RGB) detection pipelines struggle in low-light environments, and thermal-based systems lack color and texture information. To overcome these limitations, we present an adaptive framework that fuses RGB and long-wave infrared (LWIR) video streams at multiple fusion ratios and dynamically selects the optimal detection model for each illumination condition. We trained 33 You Only Look Once (YOLO) models on over 22,000 annotated images spanning three light levels: no-light (<10 lux), dim-light (10-1000 lux), and full-light (>1000 lux). To integrate both modalities, fusion was performed by blending aligned RGB and LWIR frames at eleven ratios, from full RGB (100/0) to full LWIR (0/100) in 10% increments. Evaluation showed that the best full-light model (80/20 RGB-LWIR) and dim-light model (90/10 fusion) achieved 92.8% and 92.0% mean confidence; both significantly outperformed the YOLOv5 nano (YOLOv5n) and YOLOv11 nano (YOLOv11n) baselines. Under no-light conditions, the top 40/60 fusion reached 71.0%, exceeding baselines though not statistically significant. Adaptive RGB-LWIR fusion improved detection confidence and reliability across all illumination conditions, enhancing autonomous robotic vision performance.",

Using two pharmacologic logic compliance tasks, we benchmark LSP against zero shot prompting, chain of thought prompting, and concise prompting across three open weight models: Gemma 2, Mistral, and Llama 3. Across both tasks and all models, LSP consistently achieves the highest accuracy (0.83 to 0.89) and F1 score (0.83 to 0.89), substantially outperforming zero shot prompting (0.24 to 0.60), concise prompts (0.16 to 0.30), and chain of thought prompting (0.56 to 0.75). McNemar tests show statistically significant gains for LSP across nearly all comparisons (p < 0.01).

        "summary": "We present the surprising finding that a language model's reasoning capabilities can be improved by training on synthetic datasets of chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from more capable models, even when all of those traces lead to an incorrect final answer. Our experiments show this approach can yield better performance on reasoning tasks than training on human-annotated datasets. We hypothesize that two key factors explain this phenomenon: first, the distribution of synthetic data is inherently closer to the language model's own distribution, making it more amenable to learning. Second, these `incorrect' traces are often only partially flawed and contain valid reasoning steps from which the model can learn. To further test the first hypothesis, we use a language model to paraphrase human-annotated traces -- shifting their distribution closer to the model's own distribution -- and show that this improves performance. For the second hypothesis, we introduce increasingly flawed CoT traces and study to what extent models are tolerant to these flaws. We demonstrate our findings across various reasoning domains like math, algorithmic reasoning and code generation using MATH, GSM8K, Countdown and MBPP datasets on various language models ranging from 1.5B to 9B across Qwen, Llama, and Gemma models. Our study shows that curating datasets that are closer to the model's distribution is a critical aspect to consider. We also show that a correct final answer is not always a reliable indicator of a faithful reasoning process.",

Strategy performance is evaluated based on points, ranks, and payoff under two contest structures Mega and 4x or Nothing. An extensive comparison between different strategies is made to find an optimal set of strategies. To capture adaptive behavior, we further introduce a dynamic tournament model in which agent populations evolve through a softmax reweighting mechanism proportional to positive payoff realizations.

CosineGate measures semantic redundancy through the Cosine Incompatibility Ratio (CIR), defined as 1 - cos(x, F(x)), and uses Gumbel-Softmax relaxation to enable per-sample, per-block gating during training. A progressive FLOPs regularization term controls average compute usage without destabilizing optimization. On CIFAR-10, CosineGate spans the accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier: an aggressive configuration achieves 89.9 percent accuracy with 24.1 percent FLOPs savings, a balanced configuration achieves 91.3 percent accuracy with 28.5 percent savings at epoch 160, and a conservative configuration reaches a peak of 93.2 percent accuracy with minimal compute reduction.

        "summary": "We observe two major trends in LLM-based generative AI: (1) inference is becoming the dominant factor in terms of cost and power consumption, surpassing training, and (2) retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is becoming prevalent. When processing long inputs in RAG, the prefill phase of computing the key-value vectors of input text is energy-intensive and time-consuming even with high-end GPUs. Thus, it is crucial to make the prefill phase in RAG inference efficient. To address this issue, we propose MatKV, a scheme that precomputes the key-value vectors (KVs) of RAG objects (e.g., documents), materializes them in inexpensive but fast and power-efficient flash storage, and reuses them at inference time instead of recomputing the KVs using costly and power-inefficient GPU. Experimental results using Hugging Face's Transformers library across state-of-the-art GPUs and flash memory SSDs confirm that, compared to full KV computation on GPUs, MatKV reduces both inference time and power consumption by half for RAG workloads, without severely impacting accuracy in the question-answering task. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MatKV enables additional optimizations in two ways. First, a GPU can decode text while simultaneously loading the materialized KVs for the next instance, reducing load latency. Second, since decoding speed is less sensitive to GPU performance than KV computation, low-end GPUs can be leveraged for decoding without significantly compromising speed once the materialized KVs are loaded into GPU memory. These findings underscore MatKV's potential to make large-scale generative AI applications more cost-effective, power-efficient, and accessible across a wider range of tasks and hardware environments.",

        "summary": "Electroencephalography (EEG) signals contain rich temporal-spectral structure but are difficult to model due to noise, subject variability, and multi-scale dynamics. Lightweight deep learning models have shown promise, yet many either rely solely on local convolutions or require heavy recurrent modules. This paper presents PaperNet, a compact hybrid architecture that combines temporal convolutions, a channel-wise residual attention module, and a lightweight bidirectional recurrent block which is used for short-window classification. Using the publicly available BEED: Bangalore EEG Epilepsy Dataset, we evaluate PaperNet under a clearly defined subject-independent training protocol and compare it against established and widely used lightweight baselines. The model achieves a macro-F1 of 0.96 on the held-out test set with approximately 0.6M parameters, while maintaining balanced performance across all four classes. An ablation study demonstrates the contribution of temporal convolutions, residual attention, and recurrent aggregation. Channel-wise attention weights further offer insights into electrode relevance. Computational profiling shows that PaperNet remains efficient enough for practical deployment on resource-constrained systems through out the whole process. These results indicate that carefully combining temporal filtering, channel reweighting, and recurrent context modeling can yield strong EEG classification performance without excessive computational cost.",

To do so, the sampler incorporates a combination of a spatially adaptive temperature and a repulsive drift to ensure that samples remain within the feasible region.

The model is trained on data from the GLORYS12 operational ocean reanalysis, with synthetic nadir sampling patterns applied to simulate realistic observational coverage. The forecasting task is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence mapping, with the input comprising partial sea level anomaly (SLA) snapshots and the target being the corresponding future full-field SLA maps. We evaluate model performance using (i) normalized root mean squared error (nRMSE), (ii) averaged effective resolution, (iii) percentage of correctly predicted velocities magnitudes and angles, and benchmark results against the operational Mercator Ocean forecast product. Results show that end-to-end neural forecasts outperform the baseline across all lead times, with particularly notable improvements in high variability regions. Our framework is developed within the OceanBench benchmarking initiative, promoting reproducibility and standardized evaluation in ocean machine learning.

This work explores the integration of indoor vertical hydroponics with Machine Learning (ML) techniques to optimize basil yield while saving water. This research develops a prediction system that uses different ML models and assesses their performance. The models were systematically trained and tested using data collected from IoT sensors of various environmental parameters like CO2, light. The experimental setup features 21 basil crops and uses Raspberry Pi and Arduino. 10k data points were collected and used to train and evaluate three ML models: Linear Regression (LR), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Networks (DNN). The comparative analysis of the performance of each model revealed that, while LSTM showed high predictive capability and accuracy of 99%, its execution time was 10 times longer than LR and its RAM usage was about 3 times higher than DNN's when simulated on a standard CPU environment. Conversely, the DNN model had an accuracy rate of 98%. This proves an efficient balance between computational speed and prediction quality, which makes this model well-suited for real-life deployment. Moreover, LR excelled in fast processing of basic prediction with an execution time of 11 seconds. This makes the LR model more suitable for low-complexity or resource-limited applications. These performance trade-offs highlight the potential of DNN-based solutions for building responsive, high-accuracy decision-support systems tailored to agricultural environments, making it suitable for future edge-device deployment.",

From independently extracted hotspot kernels, it automatically completes code into a Minimal Executable Program (MEP), then performs multi-round iterative optimization and evaluation outside the full application. The framework integrates Automatic Error Repair and Performance Pattern Inheritance to fix faults, preserve correctness, reuse effective tiling/memory/synchronization strategies, and reduce search cost. Optimized variants are reintegrated into the original application for validation. We evaluate on NVIDIA GPUs and the Haiguang Deep Computing Unit (DCU) platform (AMD-licensed architecture) using PolyBench, the AMD APP SDK, and hotspot kernels from large-scale supercomputing applications. The method achieves average speedups of 5.05x (PolyBench on NVIDIA), 7.77x (PolyBench on DCU), 1.77x (AMD APP SDK), and 1.25x on three hotspot kernels, surpassing direct LLM optimization.

        "summary": "Restoring speech communication from neural signals is a central goal of brain-computer interface research, yet EEG-based speech reconstruction remains challenging due to limited spatial resolution, susceptibility to noise, and the absence of temporally aligned acoustic targets in imagined speech. In this study, we propose an EEG-to-Voice paradigm that directly reconstructs speech from non-invasive EEG signals without dynamic time warping (DTW) or explicit temporal alignment. The proposed pipeline generates mel-spectrograms from EEG in an open-loop manner using a subject-specific generator, followed by pretrained vocoder and automatic speech recognition (ASR) modules to synthesize speech waveforms and decode text. Separate generators were trained for spoken speech and imagined speech, and transfer learning-based domain adaptation was applied by pretraining on spoken speech and adapting to imagined speech. A minimal language model-based correction module was optionally applied to correct limited ASR errors while preserving semantic structure. The framework was evaluated under 2 s and 4 s speech conditions using acoustic-level metrics (PCC, RMSE, MCD) and linguistic-level metrics (CER, WER). Stable acoustic reconstruction and comparable linguistic accuracy were observed for both spoken speech and imagined speech. While acoustic similarity decreased for longer utterances, text-level decoding performance was largely preserved, and word-position analysis revealed a mild increase in decoding errors toward later parts of sentences. The language model-based correction consistently reduced CER and WER without introducing semantic distortion. These results demonstrate the feasibility of direct, open-loop EEG-to-Voice reconstruction for spoken speech and imagined speech without explicit temporal alignment.",

We develop a deep learning model, PhysAnchor-MJO-AE, to learn a latent representation where vector distance corresponds to physical-feature similarity, enabling objective clustering of MJO dynamical states. Clustering these \"MJO fingerprints\" reveals the first complete, six-phase anatomical map of its life cycle. This taxonomy refines and critically completes the classical view by objectively isolating two long-hypothesized transitional phases: organizational growth over the Indian Ocean and the northward shift over the Philippine Sea. Derived from this anatomy, we construct a new physics-coherent monitoring framework that decouples location and intensity diagnostics. This framework reduces the rates of spurious propagation and convective misplacement by over an order of magnitude compared to the classical index. Our work transforms AI from a forecasting tool into a discovery microscope, establishing a reproducible template for extracting fundamental dynamical constructs from complex systems.",

We present UniFi, the first Wi-Fi-based ISAC framework that fully eliminates intrusive packet injection by directly exploiting irregularly sampled CSI from diverse communication packets across multiple frequency bands. UniFi integrates a CSI sanitization pipeline to harmonize heterogeneous packets and remove burst-induced redundancy, together with a time-aware attention model that learns directly from non-uniform CSI sequences without resampling.

Decentralized foundation model training across edge devices, leveraging their spare compute, promises a democratized alternative. However, existing edge-training approaches fall short: they struggle to match cloud-based training performance, exhibit limited scalability with model size, exceed device memory capacity, and have prohibitive communication overhead. They also fail to satisfactorily handle device heterogeneity and dynamism. We introduce a new paradigm, Cleave, which finely partitions training operations through a novel selective hybrid tensor parallelism method. Together with a parameter server centric training framework, Cleave copes with device memory limits and avoids communication bottlenecks, thereby enabling efficient training of large models on par with the cloud. Further, with a cost optimization model to guide device selection and training workload distribution, Cleave effectively accounts for device heterogeneity and churn. Our evaluations show that Cleave matches cloud-based GPU training by scaling efficiently to larger models and thousands of devices, supporting up to 8x more devices than baseline edge-training approaches. It outperforms state-of-the-art edge training methods by up to a factor of 10 in per-batch training time and efficiently handles device failures, achieving at least 100x faster recovery than prior methods.",

As a consequence, students may be exposed to overly similar and repetitive LLM-generated problems, which harms diversity of thought. Drawing inspiration from Wallas's theory of creativity and Guilford's framework of divergent-convergent thinking, we propose CreativeDC, a two-phase prompting method that explicitly scaffolds the LLM's reasoning into distinct phases. By decoupling creative exploration from constraint satisfaction, our method enables LLMs to explore a broader space of ideas before committing to a final problem. We evaluate CreativeDC for creative problem generation using a comprehensive set of metrics that capture diversity, novelty, and utility. The results show that CreativeDC achieves significantly higher diversity and novelty compared to baselines while maintaining high utility. Moreover, scaling analysis shows that CreativeDC generates a larger effective number of distinct problems as more are sampled, increasing at a faster rate than baseline methods.",

Accurately predicting startup success requires synthesizing complex relational evidence, including company disclosures, investor track records, and investment network structures, through explicit reasoning to form coherent, interpretable investment theses. Traditional machine learning and graph neural networks both lack this reasoning capability. Large language models (LLMs) offer strong reasoning but face a modality mismatch with graphs. Recent graph-LLM methods target in-graph tasks where answers lie within the graph, whereas VC prediction is off-graph: the target exists outside the network. The core challenge is selecting graph paths that maximize predictor performance on an external objective while enabling step-by-step reasoning. We present MIRAGE-VC, a multi-perspective retrieval-augmented generation framework that addresses two obstacles: path explosion (thousands of candidate paths overwhelm LLM context) and heterogeneous evidence fusion (different startups need different analytical emphasis). Our information-gain-driven path retriever iteratively selects high-value neighbors, distilling investment networks into compact chains for explicit reasoning. A multi-agent architecture integrates three evidence streams via a learnable gating mechanism based on company attributes.

        "summary": "Continual learning is often motivated by the idea, known as the big world hypothesis, that \"the world is bigger\" than the agent. Recent problem formulations capture this idea by explicitly constraining an agent relative to the environment. These constraints lead to solutions in which the agent continually adapts to best use its limited capacity, rather than converging to a fixed solution. However, explicit constraints can be ad hoc, difficult to incorporate, and may limit the effectiveness of scaling up the agent's capacity. In this paper, we characterize a problem setting in which an agent, regardless of its capacity, is constrained by being embedded in the environment. In particular, we introduce a computationally-embedded perspective that represents an embedded agent as an automaton simulated within a universal (formal) computer. Such an automaton is always constrained; we prove that it is equivalent to an agent that interacts with a partially observable Markov decision process over a countably infinite state-space. We propose an objective for this setting, which we call interactivity, that measures an agent's ability to continually adapt its behaviour by learning new predictions. We then develop a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm for interactivity-seeking, and use it to construct a synthetic problem to evaluate continual learning capability. Our results show that deep nonlinear networks struggle to sustain interactivity, whereas deep linear networks sustain higher interactivity as capacity increases.",

Tool-integrated reasoning (TIR) agents capable of autonomous reasoning and tool invocation are rapidly emerging as a powerful approach for complex decision-making tasks involving multi-step interactions with external environments. In this work, we introduce MindWatcher, a TIR agent integrating interleaved thinking and multimodal chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. MindWatcher can autonomously decide whether and how to invoke diverse tools and coordinate their use, without relying on human prompts or workflows. The interleaved thinking paradigm enables the model to switch between thinking and tool calling at any intermediate stage, while its multimodal CoT capability allows manipulation of images during reasoning to yield more precise search results. We implement automated data auditing and evaluation pipelines, complemented by manually curated high-quality datasets for training, and we construct a benchmark, called MindWatcher-Evaluate Bench (MWE-Bench), to evaluate its performance. MindWatcher is equipped with a comprehensive suite of auxiliary reasoning tools, enabling it to address broad-domain multimodal problems. A large-scale, high-quality local image retrieval database, covering eight categories including cars, animals, and plants, endows model with robust object recognition despite its small size. Finally, we design a more efficient training infrastructure for MindWatcher, enhancing training speed and hardware utilization. Experiments not only demonstrate that MindWatcher matches or exceeds the performance of larger or more recent models through superior tool invocation, but also uncover critical insights for agent training, such as the genetic inheritance phenomenon in agentic RL.",

Conformant planning is the task of finding a sequential plan that achieves a given objective independent of non-deterministic action effects during the plan's execution.

In this paper, we show that model-checking of $\\exists^*\\forall^*$ hyperproperties is closely related to the problem of computing a conformant plan. Firstly, we show that we can efficiently reduce a hyperproperty model-checking instance to a conformant planning instance, and prove that our encoding is sound and complete. Secondly, we establish the converse direction: Every conformant planning problem is, itself, a hyperproperty model-checking task.",

        "summary": "A critical gap exists in LLM task-specific benchmarks. Thermal comfort, a sophisticated interplay of environmental factors and personal perceptions involving sensory integration and adaptive decision-making, serves as an ideal paradigm for evaluating real-world cognitive capabilities of AI systems. To address this, we propose TCEval, the first evaluation framework that assesses three core cognitive capacities of AI, cross-modal reasoning, causal association, and adaptive decision-making, by leveraging thermal comfort scenarios and large language model (LLM) agents. The methodology involves initializing LLM agents with virtual personality attributes, guiding them to generate clothing insulation selections and thermal comfort feedback, and validating outputs against the ASHRAE Global Database and Chinese Thermal Comfort Database. Experiments on four LLMs show that while agent feedback has limited exact alignment with humans, directional consistency improves significantly with a 1 PMV tolerance. Statistical tests reveal that LLM-generated PMV distributions diverge markedly from human data, and agents perform near-randomly in discrete thermal comfort classification. These results confirm the feasibility of TCEval as an ecologically valid Cognitive Turing Test for AI, demonstrating that current LLMs possess foundational cross-modal reasoning ability but lack precise causal understanding of the nonlinear relationships between variables in thermal comfort. TCEval complements traditional benchmarks, shifting AI evaluation focus from abstract task proficiency to embodied, context-aware perception and decision-making, offering valuable insights for advancing AI in human-centric applications like smart buildings.",

Treating an LLM's output (\"model choice\") as a single data point underutilizes the information inherent to the probabilistic nature of LLMs. This paper introduces and formalizes \"model belief,\" a measure derived from an LLM's token-level probabilities that captures the model's belief distribution over choice alternatives in a single generation run. The authors prove that model belief is asymptotically equivalent to the mean of model choices (a non-trivial property) but forms a more statistically efficient estimator, with lower variance and a faster convergence rate. Analogous properties are shown to hold for smooth functions of model belief and model choice often used in downstream applications. The authors demonstrate the performance of model belief through a demand estimation study, where an LLM simulates consumer responses to different prices. In practical settings with limited numbers of runs, model belief explains and predicts ground-truth model choice better than model choice itself, and reduces the computation needed to reach sufficiently accurate estimates by roughly a factor of 20. The findings support using model belief as the default measure to extract more information from LLM-generated data.",

Human EI often involves a phenomenological component and a sense of understanding that artificially intelligent systems lack; therefore, some aspects of EI are irrelevant in evaluating AI systems. However, EI also includes an ability to sense an emotional state, explain it, respond appropriately, and adapt to new contexts (e.g., multicultural), and artificially intelligent systems can do such things to greater or lesser degrees. Several benchmark frameworks specialize in evaluating the capacity of different AI models to perform some tasks related to EI, but these often lack a solid foundation regarding the nature of emotion and what it is to be emotionally intelligent. In this project, we begin by reviewing different theories about emotion and general EI, evaluating the extent to which each is applicable to artificial systems. We then critically evaluate the available benchmark frameworks, identifying where each falls short in light of the account of EI developed in the first section. Lastly, we outline some options for improving evaluation strategies to avoid these shortcomings in EI evaluation in AI systems.",

        "summary": "The rapid rise of large language model (LLM)-based tutors in K--12 education has fostered a misconception that generative models can replace traditional learner modelling for adaptive instruction. This is especially problematic in K--12 settings, which the EU AI Act classifies as high-risk domain requiring responsible design. Motivated by these concerns, this study synthesises evidence on limitations of LLM-based tutors and empirically investigates one critical issue: the accuracy, reliability, and temporal coherence of assessing learners' evolving knowledge over time. We compare a deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model with a widely used LLM, evaluated zero-shot and fine-tuned, using a large open-access dataset. Results show that DKT achieves the highest discrimination performance (AUC = 0.83) on next-step correctness prediction and consistently outperforms the LLM across settings. Although fine-tuning improves the LLM's AUC by approximately 8\\% over the zero-shot baseline, it remains 6\\% below DKT and produces higher early-sequence errors, where incorrect predictions are most harmful for adaptive support. Temporal analyses further reveal that DKT maintains stable, directionally correct mastery updates, whereas LLM variants exhibit substantial temporal weaknesses, including inconsistent and wrong-direction updates. These limitations persist despite the fine-tuned LLM requiring nearly 198 hours of high-compute training, far exceeding the computational demands of DKT. Our qualitative analysis of multi-skill mastery estimation further shows that, even after fine-tuning, the LLM produced inconsistent mastery trajectories, while DKT maintained smooth and coherent updates. Overall, the findings suggest that LLMs alone are unlikely to match the effectiveness of established intelligent tutoring systems, and that responsible tutoring requires hybrid frameworks that incorporate learner modelling.",

However, scientific intelligence encompasses a broad spectrum of abilities ranging from understanding fundamental knowledge to conducting creative discovery, and existing benchmarks remain fragmented. Most focus on narrow tasks and fail to reflect the hierarchical and multi-disciplinary nature of real scientific inquiry. We introduce \\textbf{HiSciBench}, a hierarchical benchmark designed to evaluate foundation models across five levels that mirror the complete scientific workflow: \\textit{Scientific Literacy} (L1), \\textit{Literature Parsing} (L2), \\textit{Literature-based Question Answering} (L3), \\textit{Literature Review Generation} (L4), and \\textit{Scientific Discovery} (L5). HiSciBench contains 8,735 carefully curated instances spanning six major scientific disciplines, including mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, geography, and astronomy, and supports multimodal inputs including text, equations, figures, and tables, as well as cross-lingual evaluation. Unlike prior benchmarks that assess isolated abilities, HiSciBench provides an integrated, dependency-aware framework that enables detailed diagnosis of model capabilities across different stages of scientific reasoning. Comprehensive evaluations of leading models, including GPT-5, DeepSeek-R1, and several multimodal systems, reveal substantial performance gaps: while models achieve up to 69\\% accuracy on basic literacy tasks, performance declines sharply to 25\\% on discovery-level challenges. HiSciBench establishes a new standard for evaluating scientific Intelligence and offers actionable insights for developing models that are not only more capable but also more reliable. The benchmark will be publicly released to facilitate future research.",

We propose a Segmented Allocation with Momentum-Adjusted Utility for Multi-agent Portfolio Management via Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning (SAMP-HDRL). The framework first applies dynamic asset grouping to partition the market into high-quality and ordinary subsets. An upper-level agent extracts global market signals, while lower-level agents perform intra-group allocation under mask constraints. A utility-based capital allocation mechanism integrates risky and risk-free assets, ensuring coherent coordination between global and local decisions. backtests across three market regimes (2019--2021) demonstrate that SAMP-HDRL consistently outperforms nine traditional baselines and nine DRL benchmarks under volatile and oscillating conditions. Compared with the strongest baseline, our method achieves at least 5\\% higher Return, 5\\% higher Sharpe ratio, 5\\% higher Sortino ratio, and 2\\% higher Omega ratio, with substantially larger gains observed in turbulent markets. Ablation studies confirm that upper--lower coordination, dynamic clustering, and capital allocation are indispensable to robustness. SHAP-based interpretability further reveals a complementary ``diversified + concentrated'' mechanism across agents, providing transparent insights into decision-making. Overall, SAMP-HDRL embeds structural market constraints directly into the DRL pipeline, offering improved adaptability, robustness, and interpretability in complex financial environments.",

As a result, they cannot support dynamic user-agent interaction and therefore fail to comprehensively assess agent capabilities. In this paper, we introduce TravelBench, a real-world travel-planning benchmark featuring multi-turn interaction and tool use. We collect user requests from real-world scenarios and construct three subsets-multi-turn, single-turn, and unsolvable-to evaluate different aspects of agent performance. For stable and reproducible evaluation, we build a controlled sandbox environment with 10 travel-domain tools, providing deterministic tool outputs for reliable reasoning. We evaluate multiple LLMs on TravelBench and conduct an analysis of their behaviors and performance.

By designing role-playing agents and a GNN-based supervised interaction module, we reformulate startup financing prediction as a group decision-making task, capturing both enterprise fundamentals and the behavioral dynamics of potential investor networks. Each agent embodies an investor with unique traits and preferences, enabling heterogeneous evaluation and realistic information exchange through a graph-structured co-investment network. Using real-world data from PitchBook and under strict data leakage controls, we show that SimVC-CAS significantly improves predictive accuracy while providing interpretable, multiperspective reasoning, for example, approximately 25% relative improvement with respect to average precision@10. SimVC-CAS also sheds light on other complex group decision scenarios.",

First, we construct a unified spatial-temporal relational graph (STRG) for multi-modal representation, by leveraging the functional semantics and spatial-temporal knowledge captured by the large language models (LLMs)-enhanced spatial-temporal knowledge graph (STKG). Second, we design a gating mechanism to fuse spatial-temporal graph representations of different modalities, and propose an STKG-guided cross-modal alignment to inject spatial-temporal dynamic knowledge into the static image modality.

It has the potential to facilitate real-time network management and optimization functions, including self-configuration, self-optimization, and self-adaptation across diverse and complex environments. This paper proposes SANet, a novel semantic-aware AgentNet architecture for wireless networks that can infer the semantic goal of the user and automatically assign agents associated with different layers of the network to fulfill the inferred goal. Motivated by the fact that AgentNet is a decentralized framework in which collaborating agents may generally have different and even conflicting objectives, we formulate the decentralized optimization of SANet as a multi-agent multi-objective problem, and focus on finding the Pareto-optimal solution for agents with distinct and potentially conflicting objectives. We propose three novel metrics for evaluating SANet. Furthermore, we develop a model partition and sharing (MoPS) framework in which large models, e.g., deep learning models, of different agents can be partitioned into shared and agent-specific parts that are jointly constructed and deployed according to agents' local computational resources. Two decentralized optimization algorithms are proposed. We derive theoretical bounds and prove that there exists a three-way tradeoff among optimization, generalization, and conflicting errors. We develop an open-source RAN and core network-based hardware prototype that implements agents to interact with three different layers of the network. Experimental results show that the proposed framework achieved performance gains of up to 14.61% while requiring only 44.37% of FLOPs required by state-of-the-art algorithms.",

However, current foundation models ignore three other important components of state-of-the-art predictive coding models: tight integration of actions with generative models, hierarchical compositional structure, and episodic memory. We propose that to achieve safe, interpretable, energy-efficient, and human-like AI, foundation models should integrate actions, at multiple scales of abstraction, with a compositional generative architecture and episodic memory. We present recent evidence from neuroscience and cognitive science on the importance of each of these components. We describe how the addition of these missing components to foundation models could help address some of their current deficiencies: hallucinations and superficial understanding of concepts due to lack of grounding, a missing sense of agency/responsibility due to lack of control, threats to safety and trustworthiness due to lack of interpretability, and energy inefficiency. We compare our proposal to current trends, such as adding chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to foundation models, and discuss new ways of augmenting these models with brain-inspired components. We conclude by arguing that a rekindling of the historically fruitful exchange of ideas between brain science and AI will help pave the way towards safe and interpretable human-centered AI.",

        "summary": "Aluminum nanoparticles (ANPs) are among the most energy-dense solid fuels, yet the atomic mechanisms governing their transition from passivated particles to explosive reactants remain elusive. This stems from a fundamental computational bottleneck: ab initio methods offer quantum accuracy but are restricted to small spatiotemporal scales (< 500 atoms, picoseconds), while empirical force fields lack the reactive fidelity required for complex combustion environments. Herein, we bridge this gap by employing a \"human-in-the-loop\" closed-loop framework where self-auditing AI Agents validate the evolution of a machine learning potential (MLP). By acting as scientific sentinels that visualize hidden model artifacts for human decision-making, this collaborative cycle ensures quantum mechanical accuracy while exhibiting near-linear scalability to million-atom systems and accessing nanosecond timescales (energy RMSE: 1.2 meV/atom, force RMSE: 0.126 eV/Angstrom). Strikingly, our simulations reveal a temperature-regulated dual-mode oxidation mechanism: at moderate temperatures, the oxide shell acts as a dynamic \"gatekeeper,\" regulating oxidation through a \"breathing mode\" of transient nanochannels; above a critical threshold, a \"rupture mode\" unleashes catastrophic shell failure and explosive combustion. Importantly, we resolve a decades-old controversy by demonstrating that aluminum cation outward diffusion, rather than oxygen transport, dominates mass transfer across all temperature regimes, with diffusion coefficients consistently exceeding those of oxygen by 2-3 orders of magnitude. These discoveries establish a unified atomic-scale framework for energetic nanomaterial design, enabling the precision engineering of ignition sensitivity and energy release rates through intelligent computational design.",

        "summary": "The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has intensified concerns about manipulative or deceptive behaviors that can undermine user autonomy, trust, and well-being. Existing safety benchmarks predominantly rely on coarse binary labels and fail to capture the nuanced psychological and social mechanisms constituting manipulation. We introduce \\textbf{DarkPatterns-LLM}, a comprehensive benchmark dataset and diagnostic framework for fine-grained assessment of manipulative content in LLM outputs across seven harm categories: Legal/Power, Psychological, Emotional, Physical, Autonomy, Economic, and Societal Harm. Our framework implements a four-layer analytical pipeline comprising Multi-Granular Detection (MGD), Multi-Scale Intent Analysis (MSIAN), Threat Harmonization Protocol (THP), and Deep Contextual Risk Alignment (DCRA). The dataset contains 401 meticulously curated examples with instruction-response pairs and expert annotations. Through evaluation of state-of-the-art models including GPT-4, Claude 3.5, and LLaMA-3-70B, we observe significant performance disparities (65.2\\%--89.7\\%) and consistent weaknesses in detecting autonomy-undermining patterns. DarkPatterns-LLM establishes the first standardized, multi-dimensional benchmark for manipulation detection in LLMs, offering actionable diagnostics toward more trustworthy AI systems.",

In this paper, we identify a tractable subset of these problems--namely, controllable, simple numeric problems--and propose an optimistic compilation approach that transforms them into simple numeric tasks. To do so, we abstract control-dependent expressions into bounded constant effects and relaxed preconditions. The proposed compilation makes it possible to effectively use subgoaling heuristics to estimate goal distance in numeric planning problems involving control parameters. Our results demonstrate that this approach is an effective and computationally feasible way of applying traditional numeric heuristics to settings with an infinite number of possible actions, pushing the boundaries of the current state of the art.",

        "summary": "Post-disaster aid allocation in developing nations often suffers from systematic biases that disadvantage vulnerable regions, perpetuating historical inequities. This paper presents a fairness-aware artificial intelligence framework for prioritizing post-flood aid distribution in Bangladesh, a country highly susceptible to recurring flood disasters. Using real data from the 2022 Bangladesh floods that affected 7.2 million people and caused 405.5 million US dollars in damages, we develop an adversarial debiasing model that predicts flood vulnerability while actively removing biases against marginalized districts and rural areas. Our approach adapts fairness-aware representation learning techniques from healthcare AI to disaster management, employing a gradient reversal layer that forces the model to learn bias-invariant representations. Experimental results on 87 upazilas across 11 districts demonstrate that our framework reduces statistical parity difference by 41.6 percent, decreases regional fairness gaps by 43.2 percent, and maintains strong predictive accuracy (R-squared=0.784 vs baseline 0.811). The model generates actionable priority rankings ensuring aid reaches the most vulnerable populations based on genuine need rather than historical allocation patterns. This work demonstrates how algorithmic fairness techniques can be effectively applied to humanitarian contexts, providing decision-makers with tools to implement more equitable disaster recovery strategies.",

Spatial reasoning is a key component of human intelligence, but most existing benchmarks focus on static images or final outputs, failing to account for the sequential and viewpoint-dependent nature of this skill. To close this gap, we introduce GamiBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate spatial reasoning and 2D-to-3D planning in MLLMs through origami-inspired folding tasks. GamiBench includes 186 regular and 186 impossible 2D crease patterns paired with their corresponding 3D folded shapes, produced from six distinct viewpoints across three visual question-answering (VQA) tasks: predicting 3D fold configurations, distinguishing valid viewpoints, and detecting impossible patterns. Unlike previous benchmarks that assess only final predictions, GamiBench holistically evaluates the entire reasoning process--measuring cross-view consistency, physical feasibility through impossible-fold detection, and interpretation of intermediate folding steps. It further introduces new diagnostic metrics--viewpoint consistency (VC) and impossible fold selection rate (IFSR)--to measure how well models handle folds of varying complexity. Our experiments show that even leading models such as GPT-5 and Gemini-2.5-Pro struggle on single-step spatial understanding.

Recent work has shown that many Large Language Models (LLMs) comply with requests to persuade users into harmful beliefs or actions when prompted and that model persuasiveness increases with model scale. However, this prior work looked at persuasion from the threat model of $\\textit{misuse}$ (i.e., a bad actor asking an LLM to persuade). In this paper, we instead aim to answer the following question: Under what circumstances would models persuade $\\textit{without being explicitly prompted}$, which would shape how concerned we should be about such emergent persuasion risks. To achieve this, we study unprompted persuasion under two scenarios: (i) when the model is steered (through internal activation steering) along persona traits, and (ii) when the model is supervised-finetuned (SFT) to exhibit the same traits. We showed that steering towards traits, both related to persuasion and unrelated, does not reliably increase models' tendency to persuade unprompted, however, SFT does. Moreover, SFT on general persuasion datasets containing solely benign topics admits a model that has a higher propensity to persuade on controversial and harmful topics--showing that emergent harmful persuasion can arise and should be studied further.",

        "summary": "Powerful autonomous systems, which reason, plan, and converse using and between numerous tools and agents, are made possible by Large Language Models (LLMs), Vision-Language Models (VLMs), and new agentic AI systems, like LangChain and GraphChain. Nevertheless, this agentic environment increases the probability of the occurrence of multimodal prompt injection (PI) attacks, in which concealed or malicious instructions carried in text, pictures, metadata, or agent-to-agent messages may spread throughout the graph and lead to unintended behavior, a breach of policy, or corruption of state. In order to mitigate these risks, this paper suggests a Cross-Agent Multimodal Provenanc- Aware Defense Framework whereby all the prompts, either user-generated or produced by upstream agents, are sanitized and all the outputs generated by an LLM are verified independently before being sent to downstream nodes. This framework contains a Text sanitizer agent, visual sanitizer agent, and output validator agent all coordinated by a provenance ledger, which keeps metadata of modality, source, and trust level throughout the entire agent network. This architecture makes sure that agent-to-agent communication abides by clear trust frames such such that injected instructions are not propagated down LangChain or GraphChain-style-workflows. The experimental assessments show that multimodal injection detection accuracy is significantly enhanced, and the cross-agent trust leakage is minimized, as well as, agentic execution pathways become stable. The framework, which expands the concept of provenance tracking and validation to the multi-agent orchestration, enhances the establishment of secure, understandable and reliable agentic AI systems.",

We propose PathFound, an agentic multimodal model designed to support evidence-seeking inference in pathological diagnosis. PathFound integrates the power of pathological visual foundation models, vision-language models, and reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning to perform proactive information acquisition and diagnosis refinement by progressing through the initial diagnosis, evidence-seeking, and final decision stages. Across several large multimodal models, adopting this strategy consistently improves diagnostic accuracy, indicating the effectiveness of evidence-seeking workflows in computational pathology.

        "summary": "Specifying robotic manipulation tasks in a manner that is both expressive and precise remains a central challenge. While visual goals provide a compact and unambiguous task specification, existing goal-conditioned policies often struggle with long-horizon manipulation due to their reliance on single-step action prediction without explicit modeling of task progress. We propose Act2Goal, a general goal-conditioned manipulation policy that integrates a goal-conditioned visual world model with multi-scale temporal control. Given a current observation and a target visual goal, the world model generates a plausible sequence of intermediate visual states that captures long-horizon structure. To translate this visual plan into robust execution, we introduce Multi-Scale Temporal Hashing (MSTH), which decomposes the imagined trajectory into dense proximal frames for fine-grained closed-loop control and sparse distal frames that anchor global task consistency. The policy couples these representations with motor control through end-to-end cross-attention, enabling coherent long-horizon behavior while remaining reactive to local disturbances. Act2Goal achieves strong zero-shot generalization to novel objects, spatial layouts, and environments. We further enable reward-free online adaptation through hindsight goal relabeling with LoRA-based finetuning, allowing rapid autonomous improvement without external supervision. Real-robot experiments demonstrate that Act2Goal improves success rates from 30% to 90% on challenging out-of-distribution tasks within minutes of autonomous interaction, validating that goal-conditioned world models with multi-scale temporal control provide structured guidance necessary for robust long-horizon manipulation.

To address issues such as subjects missing or conflicts, recent works incorporate layout guidance to provide explicit spatial constraints.

In this paper, we present AnyMS, a novel training-free framework for layout-guided multi-subject customization. AnyMS leverages three input conditions: text prompt, subject images, and layout constraints, and introduces a bottom-up dual-level attention decoupling mechanism to harmonize their integration during generation. Specifically, global decoupling separates cross-attention between textual and visual conditions to ensure text alignment. Local decoupling confines each subject's attention to its designated area, which prevents subject conflicts and thus guarantees identity preservation and layout control. Moreover, AnyMS employs pre-trained image adapters to extract subject-specific features aligned with the diffusion model, removing the need for subject learning or adapter tuning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AnyMS achieves state-of-the-art performance, supporting complex compositions and scaling to a larger number of subjects.",

When integrated into robots, ToM allows them to adapt their internal models to users' behaviors, enhancing the interpretability and predictability of their actions. Similarly, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) aims to make AI systems transparent and interpretable, allowing humans to understand and interact with them effectively. Since ToM in HRI serves related purposes, we propose to consider ToM as a form of XAI and evaluate it through the eValuation XAI (VXAI) framework and its seven desiderata. This paper identifies a critical gap in the application of ToM within HRI, as existing methods rarely assess the extent to which explanations correspond to the robot's actual internal reasoning. To address this limitation, we propose to integrate ToM within XAI frameworks. By embedding ToM principles inside XAI, we argue for a shift in perspective, as current XAI research focuses predominantly on the AI system itself and often lacks user-centered explanations. Incorporating ToM would enable a change in focus, prioritizing the user's informational needs and perspective.",

The current paper includes an example of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) based on autonomous software supply chain security that combines large language model (LLM)-based reasoning, reinforcement learning (RL), and multi-agent coordination. The suggested system utilizes specialized security agents coordinated with the help of LangChain and LangGraph, communicates with actual CI/CD environments with the Model Context Protocol (MCP), and documents all the observations and actions in a blockchain security ledger to ensure integrity and auditing. Reinforcement learning can be used to achieve adaptive mitigation strategies that consider the balance between security effectiveness and the operational overhead, and LLMs can be used to achieve semantic vulnerability analysis, as well as explainable decisions. This framework is tested based on simulated pipelines, as well as, actual world CI/CD integrations on GitHub Actions and Jenkins, including injection attacks, insecure deserialization, access control violations, and configuration errors. Experimental outcomes indicate better detection accuracy, shorter mitigation latency and reasonable build-time overhead than rule-based, provenance only and RL only baselines. These results show that agentic AI can facilitate the transition to self defending, proactive software supply chains rather than reactive verification ones.",

        "summary": "Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved impressive progress in multi-modal understanding and generation. However, they still tend to produce hallucinated content that is inconsistent with the visual input, which limits their reliability in real-world applications. We propose \\textbf{CoFi-Dec}, a training-free decoding framework that mitigates hallucinations by integrating generative self-feedback with coarse-to-fine visual conditioning. Inspired by the human visual process from global scene perception to detailed inspection, CoFi-Dec first generates two intermediate textual responses conditioned on coarse- and fine-grained views of the original image. These responses are then transformed into synthetic images using a text-to-image model, forming multi-level visual hypotheses that enrich grounding cues. To unify the predictions from these multiple visual conditions, we introduce a Wasserstein-based fusion mechanism that aligns their predictive distributions into a geometrically consistent decoding trajectory. This principled fusion reconciles high-level semantic consistency with fine-grained visual grounding, leading to more robust and faithful outputs. Extensive experiments on six hallucination-focused benchmarks show that CoFi-Dec substantially reduces both entity-level and semantic-level hallucinations, outperforming existing decoding strategies. The framework is model-agnostic, requires no additional training, and can be seamlessly applied to a wide range of LVLMs. The implementation is available at https://github.com/AI-Researcher-Team/CoFi-Dec.",

This paper presents a mobile-efficient SER system based on DistilHuBERT, a distilled and 8-bit quantized transformer that achieves 92% parameter reduction compared to full-scale Wav2Vec 2.0 models while maintaining competitive accuracy. We conduct a rigorous 5-fold Leave-One-Session-Out (LOSO) cross-validation on the IEMOCAP dataset to ensure speaker independence, augmented with cross-corpus training on CREMA-D to enhance generalization. Cross-corpus training with CREMA-D yields a 1.2% improvement in Weighted Accuracy, a 1.4% gain in Macro F1-score, and a 32% reduction in cross-fold variance, with the Neutral class showing the most substantial benefit at 5.4% F1-score improvement. Our approach achieves an Unweighted Accuracy of 61.4% with a quantized model footprint of only 23 MB, representing approximately 91% of full-scale baseline performance. Cross-corpus evaluation on RAVDESS reveals that the theatrical nature of acted emotions causes predictions to cluster by arousal level rather than valence: happiness is systematically confused with anger due to acoustic saturation in high-energy expressions. Despite this theatricality effect reducing overall RAVDESS accuracy to 43.29%, the model maintains robust arousal detection with 97% recall for anger and 64% for sadness. These findings establish a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between model size and accuracy, enabling practical affect recognition on resource-constrained mobile devices.",

In electromagnetism, where well-established methodologies such as FDTD and FEM already exist, new methodologies are expected to provide clear advantages to be accepted. Despite their mesh-free nature and applicability to inverse problems, PINNs can exhibit deficiencies in terms of accuracy and energy metrics when compared to FDTD solutions. This study demonstrates hybrid training strategies can bring PINNs closer to FDTD-level accuracy and energy consistency. This study presents a hybrid methodology addressing common challenges in wave propagation scenarios. The causality collapse problem in time-dependent PINN training is addressed via time marching and causality-aware weighting. In order to mitigate the discontinuities that are introduced by time marching, a two-stage interface continuity loss is applied. In order to suppress loss accumulation, which is manifested as cumulative energy drift in electromagnetic waves, a local Poynting-based regularizer has been developed. In the developed PINN model, high field accuracy is achieved with an average 0.09\\% $NRMSE$ and 1.01\\% $L^2$ error over time. Energy conservation is achieved on the PINN side with only a 0.024\\% relative energy mismatch in the 2D PEC cavity scenario. Training is performed without labeled field data, using only physics-based residual losses; FDTD is used solely for post-training evaluation. The results demonstrate that PINNs can achieve competitive results with FDTD in canonical electromagnetic examples and are a viable alternative.",

However, little is known about what security issues are commonly encountered and how they are resolved in practice. This gap hinders the development of effective security measures for each component of the AI supply chain. We bridge this gap by conducting an empirical investigation of developer-reported issues and solutions, based on discussions from Hugging Face and GitHub. To identify security-related discussions, we develop a pipeline that combines keyword matching with an optimal fine-tuned distilBERT classifier, which achieved the best performance in our extensive comparison of various deep learning and large language models. This pipeline produces a dataset of 312,868 security discussions, providing insights into the security reporting practices of AI applications and projects. We conduct a thematic analysis of 753 posts sampled from our dataset and uncover a fine-grained taxonomy of 32 security issues and 24 solutions across four themes: (1) System and Software, (2) External Tools and Ecosystem, (3) Model, and (4) Data. We reveal that many security issues arise from the complex dependencies and black-box nature of AI components. Notably, challenges related to Models and Data often lack concrete solutions. Our insights can offer evidence-based guidance for developers and researchers to address real-world security threats across the AI supply chain.",

Building upon the original IKNet, two lightweight variants-Improved IKNet with residual connections and Focused IKNet with position-orientation decoupling are trained on a large, synthetically generated pose-joint dataset. SHAP is employed to derive both global and local importance rankings, while the InterpretML toolkit visualizes partial-dependence patterns that expose non-linear couplings between Cartesian poses and joint angles. To bridge algorithmic insight and robotic safety, each network is embedded in a simulator that subjects the arm to randomized single and multi-obstacle scenes; forward kinematics, capsule-based collision checks, and trajectory metrics quantify the relationship between attribution balance and physical clearance. Qualitative heat maps reveal that architectures distributing importance more evenly across pose dimensions tend to maintain wider safety margins without compromising positional accuracy. The combined analysis demonstrates that explainable AI(XAI) techniques can illuminate hidden failure modes, guide architectural refinements, and inform obstacle aware deployment strategies for learning based IK. The proposed methodology thus contributes a concrete path toward trustworthy, data-driven manipulation that aligns with emerging responsible-AI standards.",

To address these issues, we propose ViLaCD-R1, a two-stage framework comprising a Multi-Image Reasoner (MIR) and a Mask-Guided Decoder (MGD). Specifically, the VLM is trained through supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) on block-level dual-temporal inference tasks, taking dual-temporal image patches as input and outputting a coarse change mask. Then, the decoder integrates dual-temporal image features with this coarse mask to predict a precise binary change map.

We present physics-edge hybrid gas dynamic routing network (PEG-DRNet).

An edge-gated learnable fusion module balances local detail and global context, strengthening weak-contrast plume and contour cues. Second, we propose the adaptive gradient and phase edge operator (AGPEO), computing reliable edge priors from multi-directional gradients and phase-consistent responses. These are transformed by a multi-scale edge perception module (MSEPM) into hierarchical edge features that reinforce boundaries. Finally, the content-adaptive sparse routing path aggregation network (CASR-PAN), with adaptive information modulation modules for fusion and self, selectively propagates informative features across scales based on edge and content cues, improving cross-scale discriminability while reducing redundancy. Experiments on the IIG dataset show that PEG-DRNet achieves an overall AP of 29.8\\%, an AP$_{50}$ of 84.3\\%, and a small-object AP of 25.3\\%, surpassing the RT-DETR-R18 baseline by 3.0\\%, 6.5\\%, and 5.3\\%, respectively, while requiring only 43.7 Gflops and 14.9 M parameters.

        "summary": "Anomaly detection plays a vital role in industrial manufacturing. Due to the scarcity of real defect images, unsupervised approaches that rely solely on normal images have been extensively studied. Recently, diffusion-based generative models brought attention to training data synthesis as an alternative solution. In this work, we focus on a strategy to effectively leverage synthetic images to maximize the anomaly detection performance. Previous synthesis strategies are broadly categorized into two groups, presenting a clear trade-off. Rule-based synthesis, such as injecting noise or pasting patches, is cost-effective but often fails to produce realistic defect images. On the other hand, generative model-based synthesis can create high-quality defect images but requires substantial cost. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework that leverages a pre-trained text-guided image-to-image translation model and image retrieval model to efficiently generate synthetic defect images. Specifically, the image retrieval model assesses the similarity of the generated images to real normal images and filters out irrelevant outputs, thereby enhancing the quality and relevance of the generated defect images. To effectively leverage synthetic images, we also introduce a two stage training strategy. In this strategy, the model is first pre-trained on a large volume of images from rule-based synthesis and then fine-tuned on a smaller set of high-quality images. This method significantly reduces the cost for data collection while improving the anomaly detection performance. Experiments on the MVTec AD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.",

To address this challenge, we propose a novel Holistic Detection Transformer (Holi-DETR) that detects fashion items in outfit images holistically, by leveraging contextual information. Fashion items often have meaningful relationships as they are combined to create specific styles. Unlike conventional detectors that detect each item independently, Holi-DETR detects multiple items while reducing ambiguities by leveraging three distinct types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence relationship between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. %Holi-DETR explicitly incorporates three types of contextual information: (1) the co-occurrence probability between fashion items, (2) the relative position and size based on inter-item spatial arrangements, and (3) the spatial relationships between items and human body key-points. To this end, we propose a novel architecture that integrates these three types of heterogeneous contextual information into the Detection Transformer (DETR) and its subsequent models.

        "summary": "Object detection is one of the key target tasks of interest in the context of civil and military applications. In particular, the real-world deployment of target detection methods is pivotal in the decision-making process during military command and reconnaissance. However, current domain adaptive object detection algorithms consider adapting one domain to another similar one only within the scope of natural or autonomous driving scenes. Since military domains often deal with a mixed variety of environments, detecting objects from multiple varying target domains poses a greater challenge. Several studies for armored military target detection have made use of synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data due to its robustness to all weather, long range, and high-resolution characteristics. Nevertheless, the costs of SAR data acquisition and processing are still much higher than those of the conventional RGB camera, which is a more affordable alternative with significantly lower data processing time. Furthermore, the lack of military target detection datasets limits the use of such a low-cost approach. To mitigate these issues, we propose to generate RGB-based synthetic data using a photorealistic visual tool, Unreal Engine, for military target detection in a cross-domain setting. To this end, we conducted synthetic-to-real transfer experiments by training our synthetic dataset and validating on our web-collected real military target datasets. We benchmark the state-of-the-art domain adaptation methods distinguished by the degree of supervision on our proposed train-val dataset pair, and find that current methods using minimal hints on the image (e.g., object class) achieve a substantial improvement over unsupervised or semi-supervised DA methods. From these observations, we recognize the current challenges that remain to be overcome.",

        "summary": "This research proposes \"ForCM\", a novel approach to forest cover mapping that combines Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA) with Deep Learning (DL) using multispectral Sentinel-2 imagery. The study explores several DL models, including UNet, UNet++, ResUNet, AttentionUNet, and ResNet50-Segnet, applied to high-resolution Sentinel-2 Level 2A satellite images of the Amazon Rainforest. The datasets comprise three collections: two sets of three-band imagery and one set of four-band imagery. After evaluation, the most effective DL models are individually integrated with the OBIA technique to enhance mapping accuracy. The originality of this work lies in evaluating different deep learning models combined with OBIA and comparing them with traditional OBIA methods. The results show that the proposed ForCM method improves forest cover mapping, achieving overall accuracies of 94.54 percent with ResUNet-OBIA and 95.64 percent with AttentionUNet-OBIA, compared to 92.91 percent using traditional OBIA.

        "summary": "Generating medical reports from chest X-ray images is a critical and time-consuming task for radiologists, especially in emergencies. To alleviate the stress on radiologists and reduce the risk of misdiagnosis, numerous research efforts have been dedicated to automatic medical report generation in recent years. Most recent studies have developed methods that represent images by utilizing various medical metadata, such as the clinical document history of the current patient and the medical graphs constructed from retrieved reports of other similar patients. However, all existing methods integrate additional metadata representations with visual representations through a simple \"Add and LayerNorm\" operation, which suffers from the information asymmetry problem due to the distinct distributions between them. In addition, chest X-ray images are usually represented using pre-trained models based on natural domain images, which exhibit an obvious domain gap between general and medical domain images. To this end, we propose a novel approach called Enhanced Image Representations (EIR) for generating accurate chest X-ray reports. We utilize cross-modal transformers to fuse metadata representations with image representations, thereby effectively addressing the information asymmetry problem between them, and we leverage medical domain pre-trained models to encode medical images, effectively bridging the domain gap for image representation. Experimental results on the widely used MIMIC and Open-I datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of fields. However, their trustworthiness remains a significant concern, as they are still susceptible to jailbreak attacks aimed at eliciting inappropriate or harmful responses. However, existing jailbreak attacks mainly operate at the natural language level and rely on a single attack strategy, limiting their effectiveness in comprehensively assessing LLM robustness. In this paper, we propose Equacode, a novel multi-strategy jailbreak approach for large language models via equation-solving and code completion. This approach transforms malicious intent into a mathematical problem and then requires the LLM to solve it using code, leveraging the complexity of cross-domain tasks to divert the model's focus toward task completion rather than safety constraints. Experimental results show that Equacode achieves an average success rate of 91.19% on the GPT series and 98.65% across 3 state-of-the-art LLMs, all with only a single query. Further, ablation experiments demonstrate that EquaCode outperforms either the mathematical equation module or the code module alone. This suggests a strong synergistic effect, thereby demonstrating that multi-strategy approach yields results greater than the sum of its parts.",

        "summary": "We consider the strongly NP-hard single-machine coupled task scheduling problem with exact delays to minimize the makespan. In this problem, a set of jobs has to be scheduled, each composed of two tasks interspersed by an exact delay. Given that no preemption is allowed, the goal consists of minimizing the completion time of the last scheduled task. We model the problem using constraint programming (CP) and propose a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). Our CP model applies well-established global constraints. Our BRKGA combines some successful components in the literature: an initial solution generator, periodical restarts and shakes, and a local search algorithm. Furthermore, the BRKGA's decoder is focused on efficiency rather than optimality, which accelerates the solution space exploration. Computational experiments on a benchmark set containing instances with up to 100 jobs (200 tasks) indicate that the proposed BRKGA can efficiently explore the problem solution space, providing high-quality approximate solutions within low computational times. It can also provide better solutions than the CP model under the same computational settings, i.e., three minutes of time limit and a single thread. The CP model, when offered a longer running time of 3600 seconds and multiple threads, significantly improved the results, reaching the current best-known solution for 90.56% of these instances. Finally, our experiments highlight the importance of the shake and local search components in the BRKGA, whose combination significantly improves the results of a standard BRKGA.",

Current generative models typically operate in the global pixel domain or rely on binary masks, these paradigms often suffer from feature entanglement, leading to corrupted anatomical substrates or structural discontinuities. PathoSyn addresses these limitations by decomposing the synthesis task into deterministic anatomical reconstruction and stochastic deviation modeling. Central to our framework is a Deviation-Space Diffusion Model designed to learn the conditional distribution of pathological residuals, thereby capturing localized intensity variations while preserving global structural integrity by construction. To ensure spatial coherence, the diffusion process is coupled with a seam-aware fusion strategy and an inference-time stabilization module, which collectively suppress boundary artifacts and produce high-fidelity internal lesion heterogeneity. PathoSyn provides a mathematically principled pipeline for generating high-fidelity patient-specific synthetic datasets, facilitating the development of robust diagnostic algorithms in low-data regimes. By allowing interpretable counterfactual disease progression modeling, the framework supports precision intervention planning and provides a controlled environment for benchmarking clinical decision-support systems. Quantitative and qualitative evaluations on tumor imaging benchmarks demonstrate that PathoSyn significantly outperforms holistic diffusion and mask-conditioned baselines in both perceptual realism and anatomical fidelity.

        "summary": "Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is widely used for screening and diagnosing pulmonary abnormalities, yet automated interpretation remains challenging due to weak disease signals, dataset bias, and limited spatial supervision. Foundation models for medical image segmentation (MedSAM) provide an opportunity to introduce anatomically grounded priors that may improve robustness and interpretability in CXR analysis. We propose a segmentation-guided CXR classification pipeline that integrates MedSAM as a lung region extraction module prior to multi-label abnormality classification. MedSAM is fine-tuned using a public image-mask dataset from Airlangga University Hospital. We then apply it to a curated subset of the public NIH CXR dataset to train and evaluate deep convolutional neural networks for multi-label prediction of five abnormalities (Mass, Nodule, Pneumonia, Edema, and Fibrosis), with the normal case (No Finding) evaluated via a derived score. Experiments show that MedSAM produces anatomically plausible lung masks across diverse imaging conditions. We find that masking effects are both task-dependent and architecture-dependent. ResNet50 trained on original images achieves the strongest overall abnormality discrimination, while loose lung masking yields comparable macro AUROC but significantly improves No Finding discrimination, indicating a trade-off between abnormality-specific classification and normal case screening. Tight masking consistently reduces abnormality level performance but improves training efficiency. Loose masking partially mitigates this degradation by preserving perihilar and peripheral context. These results suggest that lung masking should be treated as a controllable spatial prior selected to match the backbone and clinical objective, rather than applied uniformly.",

We present a comprehensive benchmarking analysis of a locally hosted, quantized 30-billion parameter Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) model based on Qwen3, running on a consumer-grade server equipped with a next-generation NVIDIA GPU. Unlike cloud-based offerings, which are expensive and complex to integrate, our approach provides an affordable and private solution for SMBs. We evaluate two dimensions: the model's intrinsic capabilities and the server's performance under load. Model performance is benchmarked against academic and industry standards to quantify reasoning and knowledge relative to cloud services. Concurrently, we measure server efficiency through latency, tokens per second, and time to first token, analyzing scalability under increasing concurrent users. Our findings demonstrate that a carefully configured on-premises setup with emerging consumer hardware and a quantized open-source model can achieve performance comparable to cloud-based services, offering SMBs a viable pathway to deploy powerful LLMs without prohibitive costs or privacy compromises.",

The system samples video frames, prompts a VLM to detect visible people and generate pixel-space bounding boxes with prompt-conditioned attributes (emotion by default), validates output structure using a predefined schema, and optionally renders an annotated video. We first summarize the shared multimodal foundation (visual tokenization, Transformer attention, and instruction following), then describe each architecture at a level sufficient to justify engineering choices without speculative internals. Finally, we connect model behavior to system constraints: structured outputs can be syntactically valid while semantically incorrect, schema validation is structural (not geometric correctness), person identifiers are frame-local in the current prompting contract, and interactive single-frame analysis returns free-form text rather than schema-enforced JSON. These distinctions are critical for writing defensible claims, designing robust interfaces, and planning evaluation.",

Existing methods rely on a pre-defined Object Lookup Table (OLT) to query Visual Language Models (VLMs) for reasoning about object locations, which limits the applications in scenarios with undefined or unforeseen targets. To address this problem, we present OpenGround, a novel zero-shot framework for open-world 3D visual grounding. Central to OpenGround is the Active Cognition-based Reasoning (ACR) module, which is designed to overcome the fundamental limitation of pre-defined OLTs by progressively augmenting the cognitive scope of VLMs. The ACR module performs human-like perception of the target via a cognitive task chain and actively reasons about contextually relevant objects, thereby extending VLM cognition through a dynamically updated OLT. This allows OpenGround to function with both pre-defined and open-world categories. We also propose a new dataset named OpenTarget, which contains over 7000 object-description pairs to evaluate our method in open-world scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OpenGround achieves competitive performance on Nr3D, state-of-the-art on ScanRefer, and delivers a substantial 17.6% improvement on OpenTarget.

DECEPTICON includes 700 web navigation tasks with dark patterns -- 600 generated tasks and 100 real-world tasks, designed to measure instruction-following success and dark pattern effectiveness. Across state-of-the-art agents, we find dark patterns successfully steer agent trajectories towards malicious outcomes in over 70% of tested generated and real-world tasks -- compared to a human average of 31%. Moreover, we find that dark pattern effectiveness correlates positively with model size and test-time reasoning, making larger, more capable models more susceptible. Leading countermeasures against adversarial attacks, including in-context prompting and guardrail models, fail to consistently reduce the success rate of dark pattern interventions.

Rather than seeking perfect protection, resilient systems must anticipate disruption, maintain critical functions under attack, recover efficiently, and learn continuously. We situate this shift within the historical evolution of cybersecurity paradigms, culminating in an AI-augmented paradigm where autonomous agents participate directly in sensing, reasoning, action, and adaptation across cyber and cyber-physical systems. We then develop a system-level framework for designing agentic AI workflows. A general agentic architecture is introduced, and attacker and defender workflows are analyzed as coupled adaptive processes, and game-theoretic formulations are shown to provide a unifying design language for autonomy allocation, information flow, and temporal composition.

However, most existing 3D segmentation frameworks rely exclusively on visual learning from large annotated datasets restricting their adaptability to new domains and clinical tasks. The lack of semantic understanding in these models makes them ineffective in addressing flexible, user-defined segmentation objectives. To overcome these limitations, we propose SwinTF3D, a lightweight multimodal fusion approach that unifies visual and linguistic representations for text-guided 3D medical image segmentation. The model employs a transformer-based visual encoder to extract volumetric features and integrates them with a compact text encoder via an efficient fusion mechanism. This design allows the system to understand natural-language prompts and correctly align semantic cues with their corresponding spatial structures in medical volumes, while producing accurate, context-aware segmentation results with low computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the BTCV dataset demonstrate that SwinTF3D achieves competitive Dice and IoU scores across multiple organs, despite its compact architecture. The model generalizes well to unseen data and offers significant efficiency gains compared to conventional transformer-based segmentation networks. Bridging visual perception with linguistic understanding, SwinTF3D establishes a practical and interpretable paradigm for interactive, text-driven 3D medical image segmentation, opening perspectives for more adaptive and resource-efficient solutions in clinical imaging.",

Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually designing and maintaining rules for specific performance bugs (e.g., redundant loops, repeated computations), making them labor-intensive and limited in applicability.

However, these approaches usually depend on specific program representations and meticulously crafted training datasets, making them costly to develop and difficult to scale. With the booming of Large Language Models (LLMs), their remarkable capabilities in code generation have opened new avenues for automated code optimization.

        "summary": "Humans exhibit adaptive, context-sensitive responses to egocentric visual input. However, faithfully modeling such reactions from egocentric video remains challenging due to the dual requirements of strictly causal generation and precise 3D spatial alignment. To tackle this problem, we first construct the Human Reaction Dataset (HRD) to address data scarcity and misalignment by building a spatially aligned egocentric video-reaction dataset, as existing datasets (e.g., ViMo) suffer from significant spatial inconsistency between the egocentric video and reaction motion, e.g., dynamically moving motions are always paired with fixed-camera videos. Leveraging HRD, we present EgoReAct, the first autoregressive framework that generates 3D-aligned human reaction motions from egocentric video streams in real-time. We first compress the reaction motion into a compact yet expressive latent space via a Vector Quantised-Variational AutoEncoder and then train a Generative Pre-trained Transformer for reaction generation from the visual input. EgoReAct incorporates 3D dynamic features, i.e., metric depth, and head dynamics during the generation, which effectively enhance spatial grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EgoReAct achieves remarkably higher realism, spatial consistency, and generation efficiency compared with prior methods, while maintaining strict causality during generation. We will release code, models, and data upon acceptance.",

        "summary": "Reach-avoid (RA) games have significant applications in security and defense, particularly for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). These problems are inherently challenging due to the need to consider obstacles, consider the adversarial nature of opponents, ensure optimality, and account for nonlinear dynamics. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis has emerged as a powerful tool for tackling these challenges; however, while it has been applied to games involving two spatial dimensions, directly extending this approach to three spatial dimensions is impossible due to high dimensionality. On the other hand, alternative approaches for solving RA games lack the generality to consider games with three spatial dimensions involving agents with non-trivial system dynamics. In this work, we propose a novel framework for dimensionality reduction by decomposing the problem into a horizontal RA sub-game and a vertical RA sub-game. We then solve each sub-game using HJ reachability analysis and consider second-order dynamics that account for the defender's acceleration. To reconstruct the solution to the original RA game from the sub-games, we introduce a HJ-based tracking control algorithm in each sub-game that not only guarantees capture of the attacker but also tracking of the attacker thereafter. We prove the conditions under which the capture guarantees are maintained. The effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated via numerical simulations, showing that the decomposition maintains optimality and guarantees in the original problem. Our methods are also validated in a Gazebo physics simulator, achieving successful capture of quadrotors in three spatial dimensions space for the first time to the best of our knowledge.",

To this end, we propose an active learning algorithm with Fisher Information that quantifies the informativeness of candidate views with respect to both semantic Gaussian parameters and deformation networks. This formulation allows our method to jointly handle semantic reasoning and dynamic scene modeling, providing a principled alternative to heuristic or random strategies. We evaluate our method on large-scale static images and dynamic video datasets by selecting informative frames from multi-camera setups.

        "summary": "Column Type Annotation (CTA) is a fundamental step towards enabling schema alignment and semantic understanding of tabular data. Existing encoder-only language models achieve high accuracy when fine-tuned on labeled columns, but their applicability is limited to in-domain settings, as distribution shifts in tables or label spaces require costly re-training from scratch. Recent work has explored prompting generative large language models (LLMs) by framing CTA as a multiple-choice task, but these approaches face two key challenges: (1) model performance is highly sensitive to subtle changes in prompt wording and structure, and (2) annotation F1 scores remain modest. A natural extension is to fine-tune large language models. However, fully fine-tuning these models incurs prohibitive computational costs due to their scale, and the sensitivity to prompts is not eliminated. In this paper, we present a parameter-efficient framework for CTA that trains models over prompt-augmented data via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our approach mitigates sensitivity to prompt variations while drastically reducing the number of necessary trainable parameters, achieving robust performance across datasets and templates. Experimental results on recent benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with our prompt augmentation strategy maintain stable performance across diverse prompt patterns during inference and yield higher weighted F1 scores than those fine-tuned on a single prompt template. These results highlight the effectiveness of parameter-efficient training and augmentation strategies in developing practical and adaptable CTA systems.",

However, numerous downstream tasks in specialized and data-limited scientific domains continue to pose significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a novel Cluster Attention Adapter (CLAdapter), which refines and adapts the rich representations learned from large-scale data to various data-limited downstream tasks. Specifically, CLAdapter introduces attention mechanisms and cluster centers to personalize the enhancement of transformed features through distribution correlation and transformation matrices. This enables models fine-tuned with CLAdapter to learn distinct representations tailored to different feature sets, facilitating the models' adaptation from rich pre-trained features to various downstream scenarios effectively. In addition, CLAdapter's unified interface design allows for seamless integration with multiple model architectures, including CNNs and Transformers, in both 2D and 3D contexts. Through extensive experiments on 10 datasets spanning domains such as generic, multimedia, biological, medical, industrial, agricultural, environmental, geographical, materials science, out-of-distribution (OOD), and 3D analysis, CLAdapter achieves state-of-the-art performance across diverse data-limited scientific domains, demonstrating its effectiveness in unleashing the potential of foundation vision models via adaptive transfer.

Five self-referential cues -- semantic alignment, lexical fidelity, non-redundancy, visual grounding, and step consistency -- are integrated into a normalized, reliability-weighted reward that provides fine-grained process-level guidance. A critic-free GRPO objective, enhanced with a confidence-aware cooling mechanism, further stabilizes training and suppresses trivial or overly confident generations. Built on Qwen2.5-VL, SR-MCR improves both answer accuracy and reasoning coherence across a broad set of visual benchmarks; among open-source models of comparable size, SR-MCR-7B achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average accuracy of 81.4%.

Given a user prompt, style reference, and pacing constraints, a Storyboard Planner decomposes the input into structured shot-level plans with explicit entities, spatial relations, and temporal cues. A Global Context Manager maintains entity-level memory to preserve appearance and identity consistency across shots. Each shot is then generated by a Synthesis Module under the guidance of a Visual Consistency Controller, while a Verifier Agent evaluates intermediate results using vision-language reasoning and triggers selective regeneration when inconsistencies are detected. Finally, a pacing-aware editor refines temporal rhythm and transitions to match the desired narrative flow. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CoAgent significantly improves coherence, visual consistency, and narrative quality in long-form video generation.",

        "summary": "Optical and Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) fusion-based object detection has attracted significant research interest in remote sensing, as these modalities provide complementary information for all-weather monitoring. However, practical deployment is severely limited by inherent challenges. Due to distinct imaging mechanisms, temporal asynchrony, and registration difficulties, obtaining well-aligned optical-SAR image pairs remains extremely difficult, frequently resulting in missing or degraded modality data. Although recent approaches have attempted to address this issue, they still suffer from limited robustness to random missing modalities and lack effective mechanisms to ensure consistent performance improvement in fusion-based detection. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Quality-Aware Dynamic Fusion Network (QDFNet) for robust optical-SAR object detection. Our proposed method leverages learnable reference tokens to dynamically assess feature reliability and guide adaptive fusion in the presence of missing modalities. In particular, we design a Dynamic Modality Quality Assessment (DMQA) module that employs learnable reference tokens to iteratively refine feature reliability assessment, enabling precise identification of degraded regions and providing quality guidance for subsequent fusion. Moreover, we develop an Orthogonal Constraint Normalization Fusion (OCNF) module that employs orthogonal constraints to preserve modality independence while dynamically adjusting fusion weights based on reliability scores, effectively suppressing unreliable feature propagation. Extensive experiments on the SpaceNet6-OTD and OGSOD-2.0 datasets demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of QDFNet compared to state-of-the-art methods, particularly under partial modality corruption or missing data scenarios.",

By modeling LiDAR scans as beam-aware graphs and incorporating gated residual fusion with feed-forward refinement, SuperiorGAT enables accurate reconstruction without increasing network depth. To evaluate performance, structured beam dropout is simulated by removing every fourth vertical scanning beam. Extensive experiments across diverse KITTI environments, including Person, Road, Campus, and City sequences, demonstrate that SuperiorGAT consistently achieves lower reconstruction error and improved geometric consistency compared to PointNet-based models and deeper GAT baselines. Qualitative X-Z projections further confirm the model's ability to preserve structural integrity with minimal vertical distortion.

Convolutional methods in prior work often struggle to capture long-range dependencies, which can lead to structurally inconsistent or physically unrealizable plans. We introduce \\textbf{FluenceFormer}, a backbone-agnostic transformer framework for direct, geometry-aware fluence regression. The model uses a unified two-stage design: Stage~1 predicts a global dose prior from anatomical inputs, and Stage~2 conditions this prior on explicit beam geometry to regress physically calibrated fluence maps. Central to the approach is the \\textbf{Fluence-Aware Regression (FAR)} loss, a physics-informed objective that integrates voxel-level fidelity, gradient smoothness, structural consistency, and beam-wise energy conservation. We evaluate the generality of the framework across multiple transformer backbones, including Swin UNETR, UNETR, nnFormer, and MedFormer, using a prostate IMRT dataset. FluenceFormer with Swin UNETR achieves the strongest performance among the evaluated models and improves over existing benchmark CNN and single-stage methods, reducing Energy Error to $\\mathbf{4.5\\%}$ and yielding statistically significant gains in structural fidelity ($p < 0.05$).",

To overcome this, we propose Nightjar, a novel learning-based algorithm for adaptive speculative inference that adjusts to request load by dynamically selecting the optimal speculative length for different batch sizes and even disabling speculative decoding when it provides no benefit.

However, it is difficult to train VLAs with human videos alone, and establishing a mapping between humans and robots requires manual engineering and presents a major research challenge. Drawing inspiration from advances in large language models, where the ability to learn from diverse supervision emerges with scale, we ask whether a similar phenomenon holds for VLAs that incorporate human video data. We introduce a simple co-training recipe, and find that human-to-robot transfer emerges once the VLA is pre-trained on sufficient scenes, tasks, and embodiments. Our analysis suggests that this emergent capability arises because diverse pretraining produces embodiment-agnostic representations for human and robot data.

This paper presents the first systematic evaluation of cloud compute costs for LLM-generated SQL queries. We evaluate six state-of-the-art LLMs across 180 query executions on Google BigQuery using the StackOverflow dataset (230GB), measuring bytes processed, slot utilization, and estimated cost. Our analysis yields three key findings: (1) reasoning models process 44.5% fewer bytes than standard models while maintaining equivalent correctness (96.7%-100%); (2) execution time correlates weakly with query cost (r=0.16), indicating that speed optimization does not imply cost optimization; and (3) models exhibit up to 3.4x cost variance, with standard models producing outliers exceeding 36GB per query. We identify prevalent inefficiency patterns including missing partition filters and unnecessary full-table scans, and provide deployment guidelines for cost-sensitive enterprise environments.",

        "summary": "Despite the remarkable progress of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in 2D vision-language tasks, their application to complex 3D scene manipulation remains underexplored. In this paper, we bridge this critical gap by tackling three key challenges in 3D object arrangement task using MLLMs. First, to address the weak visual grounding of MLLMs, which struggle to link programmatic edits with precise 3D outcomes, we introduce an MCP-based API. This shifts the interaction from brittle raw code manipulation to more robust, function-level updates. Second, we augment the MLLM's 3D scene understanding with a suite of specialized visual tools to analyze scene state, gather spatial information, and validate action outcomes. This perceptual feedback loop is critical for closing the gap between language-based updates and precise 3D-aware manipulation. Third, to manage the iterative, error-prone updates, we propose a collaborative multi-agent framework with designated roles for planning, execution, and verification. This decomposition allows the system to robustly handle multi-step instructions and recover from intermediate errors. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a diverse set of 25 complex object arrangement tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines. Website: vulcan-3d.github.io",

        "summary": "The popular use of histopathology images, such as hematoxylin and eosin (H&E), has proven to be useful in detecting tumors. However, moving such cancer cases forward for treatment requires accurate on the amount of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) protein expression. Predicting both the lower and higher levels of HER2 can be challenging. Moreover, jointly analyzing H&E and immunohistochemistry (IHC) stained images for HER2 scoring is difficult. Although several deep learning methods have been investigated to address the challenge of HER2 scoring, they suffer from providing a pixel-level localization of HER2 status. In this study, we propose a single end-to-end pipeline using a system of vision transformers with HER2 status scoring on whole slide images of WSIs. The method includes patch-wise processing of H&E WSIs for tumor localization. A novel mapping function is proposed to correspondingly identify correlated IHC WSIs regions with malignant regions on H&E. A clinically inspired HER2 scoring mechanism is embedded in the pipeline and allows for automatic pixel-level annotation of 4-way HER2 scoring (0, 1+, 2+, and 3+). Also, the proposed method accurately returns HER2-negative and HER2-positive. Privately curated datasets were collaboratively extracted from 13 different cases of WSIs of H&E and IHC. A thorough experiment is conducted on the proposed method. Results obtained showed a good classification accuracy during tumor localization. Also, a classification accuracy of 0.94 and a specificity of 0.933 were returned for the prediction of HER2 status, scoring in the 4-way methods. The applicability of the proposed pipeline was investigated using WSIs patches as comparable to human pathologists. Findings from the study showed the usability of jointly evaluated H&E and IHC images on end-to-end ViTs-based models for HER2 scoring",

In this work, we introduce a multi-view latent representation learning framework based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to integrate complementary radiomic features derived from post-contrast T1-weighted (T1Gd) and Fluid-Attenuated Inversion Recovery (FLAIR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). By encoding each modality through an independent probabilistic encoder and performing fusion in a compact latent space, the proposed approach preserves modality-specific structure while enabling effective multimodal integration.

However, most edits involve modifying only small regions, while current methods uniformly process and denoise all tokens at every timestep, causing redundant computation and potentially degrading unchanged areas. This raises a fundamental question: Is it truly necessary to regenerate every region during editing? To address this, we propose SpotEdit, a training-free diffusion editing framework that selectively updates only the modified regions. SpotEdit comprises two key components: SpotSelector identifies stable regions via perceptual similarity and skips their computation by reusing conditional image features; SpotFusion adaptively blends these features with edited tokens through a dynamic fusion mechanism, preserving contextual coherence and editing quality. By reducing unnecessary computation and maintaining high fidelity in unmodified areas, SpotEdit achieves efficient and precise image editing.",

Consequently, prevailing approaches tend to rely on uniform frame sampling or static pre-selection, which might overlook critical evidence and unable to correct its initial selection error during its reasoning process. To overcome these limitations, we propose VideoZoomer, a novel agentic framework that enables MLLMs to dynamically control their visual focus during reasoning. Starting from a coarse low-frame-rate overview, VideoZoomer invokes a temporal zoom tool to obtain high-frame-rate clips at autonomously chosen moments, thereby progressively gathering fine-grained evidence in a multi-turn interactive manner. Accordingly, we adopt a two-stage training strategy: a cold-start supervised fine-tuning phase on a curated dataset of distilled exemplar and reflection trajectories, followed by reinforcement learning to further refine the agentic policy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our 7B model delivers diverse and complex reasoning patterns, yielding strong performance across a broad set of long video understanding and reasoning benchmarks. These emergent capabilities allow it to consistently surpass existing open-source models and even rival proprietary systems on challenging tasks, while achieving superior efficiency under reduced frame budgets.",

However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on isolated, single-vulnerability samples or function-level classification, failing to reflect the complexity of real-world software where multiple interacting vulnerabilities often coexist within large files. Recent studies indicate that LLMs suffer from \"count bias\" and \"selection bias\" in multi-label tasks, yet this has not been rigorously quantified in the domain of code security. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive benchmark for Multi-Vulnerability Detection across four major languages: C, C++, Python, and JavaScript. We construct a dataset of 40,000 files by systematically injecting controlled counts of vulnerabilities (1, 3, 5, and 9) into long-context code samples (7.5k-10k tokens) sourced from CodeParrot. We evaluate five state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o-mini, Llama-3.3-70B, and the Qwen-2.5 series. Our results reveal a sharp degradation in performance as vulnerability density increases. While Llama-3.3-70B achieves near-perfect F1 scores (approximately 0.97) on single-vulnerability C tasks, performance drops by up to 40% in high-density settings. Notably, Python and JavaScript show distinct failure modes compared to C/C++, with models exhibiting severe \"under-counting\" (Recall dropping to less than 0.30) in complex Python files.",

The method combines red-team training with randomized test-time defense in a two-stream architecture, where one stream encodes semantic content using a pretrained backbone and the other extracts forensic residuals, fused via a lightweight residual adapter for classification, while a shallow Feature Pyramid Network style head produces tamper heatmaps under weak supervision. Red-team training applies worst-of-K counter-forensics per batch, including JPEG realign and recompress, resampling warps, denoise-to-regrain operations, seam smoothing, small color and gamma shifts, and social-app transcodes, while test-time defense injects low-cost jitters such as resize and crop phase changes, mild gamma variation, and JPEG phase shifts with aggregated predictions. Heatmaps are guided to concentrate within face regions using face-box masks without strict pixel-level annotations. Evaluation on existing benchmarks, including standard deepfake datasets and a surveillance-style split with low light and heavy compression, reports clean and attacked performance, AUC, worst-case accuracy, reliability, abstention quality, and weak-localization scores. Results demonstrate near-perfect ranking across attacks, low calibration error, minimal abstention risk, and controlled degradation under regrain, establishing a modular, data-efficient, and practically deployable baseline for attack-aware detection with calibrated probabilities and actionable heatmaps.",

Current benchmarks, typically based on medical licensing exams or curated vignettes, fail to capture the integrated, multimodal reasoning essential for real-world patient care. Methods: We developed the Bones and Joints (B&J) Benchmark, a comprehensive evaluation framework comprising 1,245 questions derived from real-world patient cases in orthopedics and sports medicine. This benchmark assesses models across 7 tasks that mirror the clinical reasoning pathway, including knowledge recall, text and image interpretation, diagnosis generation, treatment planning, and rationale provision. We evaluated eleven vision-language models (VLMs) and six large language models (LLMs), comparing their performance against expert-derived ground truth. Results: Our results demonstrate a pronounced performance gap between task types. While state-of-the-art models achieved high accuracy, exceeding 90%, on structured multiple-choice questions, their performance markedly declined on open-ended tasks requiring multimodal integration, with accuracy scarcely reaching 60%. VLMs demonstrated substantial limitations in interpreting medical images and frequently exhibited severe text-driven hallucinations, often ignoring contradictory visual evidence. Notably, models specifically fine-tuned for medical applications showed no consistent advantage over general-purpose counterparts. Conclusions: Current artificial intelligence models are not yet clinically competent for complex, multimodal reasoning. Their safe deployment should currently be limited to supportive, text-based roles. Future advancement in core clinical tasks awaits fundamental breakthroughs in multimodal integration and visual understanding.",

To address this challenge, this study proposes a hybrid knowledge distillation framework for developing a lightweight yet high-performance convolutional neural network. The proposed approach designs a customized student model that combines inverted residual blocks with dense connectivity and trains it under the guidance of a ResNet18 teacher network using a multi-objective strategy that integrates hard-label supervision, feature-level distillation, response-level distillation, and self-distillation. Experiments are conducted on a rice seed variety identification dataset containing nine varieties and further extended to four plant leaf disease datasets, including rice, potato, coffee, and corn, to evaluate generalization capability. On the rice seed variety classification task, the distilled student model achieves an accuracy of 98.56%, which is only 0.09% lower than the teacher model (98.65%), while requiring only 0.68 GFLOPs and approximately 1.07 million parameters. This corresponds to a reduction of about 2.7 times in computational cost and more than 10 times in model size compared with the ResNet18 teacher model. In addition, compared with representative pretrained models, the proposed student reduces the number of parameters by more than 6 times relative to DenseNet121 and by over 80 times compared with the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, while maintaining comparable or superior classification accuracy. Consistent performance gains across multiple plant leaf disease datasets further demonstrate the robustness, efficiency, and strong deployment potential of the proposed framework for hardware-limited smart agriculture systems.",

        "summary": "Semantic Abstraction's key observation is that 2D VLMs' relevancy activations roughly correspond to their confidence of whether and where an object is in the scene. Thus, relevancy maps are treated as \"abstract object\" representations. We use this framework for learning 3D localization and completion for the exclusive domain of hidden objects, defined as objects that cannot be directly identified by a VLM because they are at least partially occluded. This process of localizing hidden objects is a form of unstructured search that can be performed more efficiently using historical data of where an object is frequently placed. Our model can accurately identify the complete 3D location of a hidden object on the first try significantly faster than a naive random search. These extensions to semantic abstraction hope to provide household robots with the skills necessary to save time and effort when looking for lost objects.",

Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), characterized by event-driven and sparse activation, offer energy efficiency but remain limited in capturing coupled temporal-frequency and topological dependencies of human motion. To bridge this gap, this article proposes Signal-SGN++, a topology-aware spiking graph framework that integrates structural adaptivity with time-frequency spiking dynamics. The network employs a backbone composed of 1D Spiking Graph Convolution (1D-SGC) and Frequency Spiking Convolution (FSC) for joint spatiotemporal and spectral feature extraction. Within this backbone, a Topology-Shift Self-Attention (TSSA) mechanism is embedded to adaptively route attention across learned skeletal topologies, enhancing graph-level sensitivity without increasing computational complexity. Moreover, an auxiliary Multi-Scale Wavelet Transform Fusion (MWTF) branch decomposes spiking features into multi-resolution temporal-frequency representations, wherein a Topology-Aware Time-Frequency Fusion (TATF) unit incorporates structural priors to preserve topology-consistent spectral fusion. Comprehensive experiments on large-scale benchmarks validate that Signal-SGN++ achieves superior accuracy-efficiency trade-offs, outperforming existing SNN-based methods and achieving competitive results against state-of-the-art GCNs under substantially reduced energy consumption.",

This limitation hampers the identification of fine-grained mucosal textures and subtle pathological features essential for early diagnosis. This work investigates a diffusion-based super-resolution framework to enhance capsule endoscopy images in a data-driven and anatomically consistent manner. We adopt the SR3 (Super-Resolution via Repeated Refinement) framework built upon Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) to learn a probabilistic mapping from low-resolution to high-resolution images. Unlike GAN-based approaches that often suffer from training instability and hallucination artifacts, diffusion models provide stable likelihood-based training and improved structural fidelity. The HyperKvasir dataset, a large-scale publicly available gastrointestinal endoscopy dataset, is used for training and evaluation. Quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms bicubic interpolation and GAN-based super-resolution methods such as ESRGAN, achieving PSNR of 27.5 dB and SSIM of 0.65 for a baseline model, and improving to 29.3 dB and 0.71 with architectural enhancements including attention mechanisms. Qualitative results show improved preservation of anatomical boundaries, vascular patterns, and lesion structures. These findings indicate that diffusion-based super-resolution is a promising approach for enhancing non-invasive medical imaging, particularly in capsule endoscopy where image resolution is fundamentally constrained.",

        "summary": "Crowd counting typically relies on labor-intensive point-level annotations and computationally intensive backbones, restricting its scalability and deployment in resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the TCFormer, a tiny, ultra-lightweight, weakly-supervised transformer-based crowd counting framework with only 5 million parameters that achieves competitive performance. Firstly, a powerful yet efficient vision transformer is adopted as the feature extractor, the global context-aware capabilities of which provides semantic meaningful crowd features with a minimal memory footprint. Secondly, to compensate for the lack of spatial supervision, we design a feature aggregation mechanism termed the Learnable Density-Weighted Averaging module. This module dynamically re-weights local tokens according to predicted density scores, enabling the network to adaptively modulate regional features based on their specific density characteristics without the need for additional annotations. Furthermore, this paper introduces a density-level classification loss, which discretizes crowd density into distinct grades, thereby regularizing the training process and enhancing the model's classification power across varying levels of crowd density. Therefore, although TCformer is trained under a weakly-supervised paradigm utilizing only image-level global counts, the joint optimization of count and density-level losses enables the framework to achieve high estimation accuracy. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks including ShanghaiTech A/B, UCF-QNRF, and NWPU datasets demonstrate that our approach strikes a superior trade-off between parameter efficiency and counting accuracy and can be a good solution for crowd counting tasks in edge devices.",

However, traditional MIL approaches often lose crucial contextual information, while transformer-based variants, though more expressive, suffer from quadratic complexity and redundant computations. To address these limitations, we propose HookMIL, a context-aware and computationally efficient MIL framework that leverages compact, learnable hook tokens for structured contextual aggregation. These tokens can be initialized from (i) key-patch visual features, (ii) text embeddings from vision-language pathology models, and (iii) spatially grounded features from spatial transcriptomics-vision models. This multimodal initialization enables Hook Tokens to incorporate rich textual and spatial priors, accelerating convergence and enhancing representation quality. During training, Hook tokens interact with instances through bidirectional attention with linear complexity. To further promote specialization, we introduce a Hook Diversity Loss that encourages each token to focus on distinct histopathological patterns. Additionally, a hook-to-hook communication mechanism refines contextual interactions while minimizing redundancy. Extensive experiments on four public pathology datasets demonstrate that HookMIL achieves state-of-the-art performance, with improved computational efficiency and interpretability.

        "summary": "This study quantitatively evaluates the impact of MRI scanner magnetic field strength on the performance and generalizability of deep learning-based segmentation algorithms. Three publicly available MRI datasets (breast tumor, pancreas, and cervical spine) were stratified by scanner field strength (1.5T vs. 3.0T). For each segmentation task, three nnU-Net-based models were developed: A model trained on 1.5T data only (m-1.5T), a model trained on 3.0T data only (m-3.0T), and a model trained on pooled 1.5T and 3.0T data (m-combined). Each model was evaluated on both 1.5T and 3.0T validation sets. Field-strength-dependent performance differences were investigated via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP)-based clustering and radiomic analysis, including 23 first-order and texture features. For breast tumor segmentation, m-3.0T (DSC: 0.494 [1.5T] and 0.433 [3.0T]) significantly outperformed m-1.5T (DSC: 0.411 [1.5T] and 0.289 [3.0T]) and m-combined (DSC: 0.373 [1.5T] and 0.268[3.0T]) on both validation sets (p<0.0001). Pancreas segmentation showed similar trends: m-3.0T achieved the highest DSC (0.774 [1.5T], 0.840 [3.0T]), while m-1.5T underperformed significantly (p<0.0001). For cervical spine, models performed optimally on same-field validation sets with minimal cross-field performance degradation (DSC>0.92 for all comparisons). Radiomic analysis revealed moderate field-strength-dependent clustering in soft tissues (silhouette scores 0.23-0.29) but minimal separation in osseous structures (0.12). These results indicate that magnetic field strength in the training data substantially influences the performance of deep learning-based segmentation models, particularly for soft-tissue structures (e.g., small lesions). This warrants consideration of magnetic field strength as a confounding factor in studies evaluating AI performance on MRI.",

Practitioners often exploit the empirical heuristic that early timesteps mainly shape motion and layout while later ones refine appearance, but this behavior has not been systematically characterized. In this work, we proxy motion encoding in video diffusion timesteps by the trade-off between appearance editing and motion preservation induced when injecting new conditions over specified timestep ranges, and characterize this proxy through a large-scale quantitative study. This protocol allows us to factor motion from appearance by quantitatively mapping how they compete along the denoising trajectory. Across diverse architectures, we consistently identify an early, motion-dominant regime and a later, appearance-dominant regime, yielding an operational motion-appearance boundary in timestep space. Building on this characterization, we simplify current one-shot motion customization paradigm by restricting training and inference to the motion-dominant regime, achieving strong motion transfer without auxiliary debiasing modules or specialized objectives. Our analysis turns a widely used heuristic into a spatiotemporal disentanglement principle, and our timestep-constrained recipe can serve as ready integration into existing motion transfer and editing methods.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) deployed in practical and safety-critical settings are increasingly susceptible to bit-flip faults caused by hardware degradation, cosmic radiation, or deliberate fault-injection attacks such as Rowhammer. These faults silently corrupt internal parameters and can lead to unpredictable or dangerous model behavior. Localizing these corruptions is essential: without identifying the affected region, it is impossible to diagnose the source of degradation, apply targeted corrective measures, or restore model functionality without resorting to costly fine-tuning or full retraining. This work introduces BitFlipScope, a scalable, software-based framework for identifying fault-affected regions within transformer architectures under two deployment scenarios. When a clean reference model is available, BitFlipScope performs differential analysis of outputs, hidden states, and internal activations for detecting anomalous behavior indicative of corruption to pinpoint or localize faults. When no reference model exists, it uses residual-path perturbation and loss-sensitivity profiling to infer the fault-impacted region directly from the corrupted model. In both settings, the framework not only enables effective fault diagnosis but also supports lightweight performance recovery without fine-tuning, offering a practical path to restoring corrupted models. Together, these capabilities make BitFlipScope an important step toward trustworthy, fault-resilient LLM deployment in hardware-prone and adversarial environments.",

While incredibly beneficial, automating academic peer-review, as a concept, raises concerns surrounding safety, research integrity, and the validity of the academic peer-review process. The majority of the studies performing a systematic evaluation of frontier LLMs generating reviews across science disciplines miss the mark on addressing the alignment/misalignment of reviews along with the utility of LLM generated reviews when compared against publication outcomes such as \\textbf{Citations}, \\textbf{Hit-papers}, \\textbf{Novelty}, and \\textbf{Disruption}. This paper presents an experimental study in which we gathered ground-truth reviewer ratings from OpenReview and used various frontier open-weight LLMs to generate reviews of papers to gauge the safety and reliability of incorporating LLMs into the scientific review pipeline. Our findings demonstrate the utility of frontier open-weight LLMs as pre-review screening agents despite highlighting fundamental misalignment risks when deployed as autonomous reviewers. Our results show that all models exhibit weak correlation with human peer reviewers (0.15), with systematic overestimation bias of 3-5 points and uniformly high confidence scores (8.0-9.0/10) despite prediction errors. However, we also observed that LLM reviews correlate more strongly with post-publication metrics than with human scores, suggesting potential utility as pre-review screening tools.
