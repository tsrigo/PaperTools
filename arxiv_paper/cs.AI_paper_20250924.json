        "summary": "Proper initialization is crucial for any system, particularly in multi-agent systems (MAS), where it plays a pivotal role in determining both the system's efficiency and effectiveness. However, existing MAS initialization methods do not fully account for the collaborative needs of the generated agents in subsequent stages. Inspired by the principles of effective team composition, we propose AgentInit, which aims to optimize the structure of agent teams. Specifically, in addition to multi-round interactions and reflections between agents during agent generation, AgentInit incorporates a Natural Language to Format mechanism to ensure consistency and standardization. Balanced team selection strategies using Pareto principles are subsequently applied to jointly consider agent team diversity and task relevance to promote effective and efficient collaboration and enhance overall system performance. Experiments show that AgentInit consistently outperforms state-of-the-art initialization methods and pre-defined strategies across various frameworks and tasks, achieving an overall performance improvement of up to 1.2 and 1.6, respectively, while also significantly reducing token consumption. Further analysis confirms its strong transferability to similar tasks and verifies the effectiveness of its key components, demonstrating its capability and adaptability as a reliable MAS initialization method.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards. We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs. Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in query costs.",

        "summary": "Causal representation learning seeks to recover latent factors that generate observational data through a mixing function. Needing assumptions on latent structures or relationships to achieve identifiability in general, prior works often build upon conditional independence given known auxiliary variables. However, prior frameworks limit the scope of auxiliary variables to be external to the mixing function. Yet, in some cases, system-driving latent factors can be easily observed or extracted from data, possibly facilitating identification. In this paper, we introduce a framework of observable sources being auxiliaries, serving as effective conditioning variables. Our main results show that one can identify entire latent variables up to subspace-wise transformations and permutations using volume-preserving encoders. Moreover, when multiple known auxiliary variables are available, we offer a variable-selection scheme to choose those that maximize recoverability of the latent factors given knowledge of the latent causal graph. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through experiments on synthetic graph and image data, thereby extending the boundaries of current approaches.",

        "summary": "Algorithmic evaluation of procedurally generated content struggles to find metrics that align with human experience, particularly for composite artefacts. Automatic decomposition as a possible solution requires concepts that meet a range of properties. To this end, drawing on Games Studies and Game AI research, we introduce the nested concepts of \\textit{Landmarks}, \\textit{Monuments}, and \\textit{Beacons}. These concepts are based on the artefact's perceivability, evocativeness, and Call to Action, all from a player-centric perspective. These terms are generic to games and usable across genres. We argue that these entities can be found and evaluated with techniques currently used in both research and industry, opening a path towards a fully automated decomposition of PCG, and evaluation of the salient sub-components. Although the work presented here emphasises mixed-initiative PCG and compositional PCG, we believe it applies beyond those domains. With this approach, we intend to create a connection between humanities and technical game research and allow for better computational PCG evaluation",

For this process, the company provided us with a novel and original event log with 169,523 traces, which we can make publicly available.

The model is based on constrained matrix factorization, where user types are explicitly represented and predicted item scores share the same scale as observed ratings, making the model's internal representations and predicted scores directly interpretable. This structure is translated into natural language explanations using carefully designed LLM prompts. Many works in explainable AI rely on automatic evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture users' actual needs and perceptions. In contrast, we adopt a user-centered approach: we conduct a study with 326 participants who assessed the quality of the explanations across five key dimensions-transparency, effectiveness, persuasion, trust, and satisfaction-as well as the recommendations themselves.To evaluate how different explanation strategies are perceived, we generate multiple explanation types from the same underlying model, varying the input information provided to the LLM. Our analysis reveals that all explanation types are generally well received, with moderate statistical differences between strategies. User comments further underscore how participants react to each type of explanation, offering complementary insights beyond the quantitative results.",

        "summary": "Driven by the rapid advancements of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based agents have emerged as powerful intelligent systems capable of human-like cognition, reasoning, and interaction. These agents are increasingly being deployed across diverse real-world applications, including student education, scientific research, and financial analysis. However, despite their remarkable potential, LLM-based agents remain vulnerable to hallucination issues, which can result in erroneous task execution and undermine the reliability of the overall system design. Addressing this critical challenge requires a deep understanding and a systematic consolidation of recent advances on LLM-based agents. To this end, we present the first comprehensive survey of hallucinations in LLM-based agents. By carefully analyzing the complete workflow of agents, we propose a new taxonomy that identifies different types of agent hallucinations occurring at different stages. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth examination of eighteen triggering causes underlying the emergence of agent hallucinations. Through a detailed review of a large number of existing studies, we summarize approaches for hallucination mitigation and detection, and highlight promising directions for future research. We hope this survey will inspire further efforts toward addressing hallucinations in LLM-based agents, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and reliable agent systems.",

        "summary": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have emphasized the critical role of fine-tuning (FT) techniques in adapting LLMs to specific tasks, especially when retraining from scratch is computationally infeasible. Fine-tuning enables LLMs to leverage task- or domain-specific data, producing models that more effectively meet the requirements of targeted applications. However, con- ventional FT approaches often suffer from catastrophic forgetting and suboptimal data efficiency, limiting their real-world applicability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes DEAL, a novel framework that integrates Low-Rank Adapta- tion (LoRA) with a continuous fine-tuning strategy. By incorporating knowledge retention and adaptive parameter update modules, the framework mitigates the lim- itations of existing FT methods while maintaining efficiency in privacy-preserving settings. Experiments on 15 diverse datasets show that DEAL consistently outper- forms baseline methods, yielding substantial gains in task accuracy and resource efficiency. These findings demonstrate the potential of our approach to advance continual adaptation in LLMs by enhancing task performance while improving resource efficiency.",

        "summary": "Visual Spatial Reasoning (VSR) is a core human cognitive ability and a critical requirement for advancing embodied intelligence and autonomous systems. Despite recent progress in Vision-Language Models (VLMs), achieving human-level VSR remains highly challenging due to the complexity of representing and reasoning over three-dimensional space. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation of VSR in VLMs, encompassing a review of existing methodologies across input modalities, model architectures, training strategies, and reasoning mechanisms. Furthermore, we categorize spatial intelligence into three levels of capability, ie, basic perception, spatial understanding, spatial planning, and curate SIBench, a spatial intelligence benchmark encompassing nearly 20 open-source datasets across 23 task settings. Experiments with state-of-the-art VLMs reveal a pronounced gap between perception and reasoning, as models show competence in basic perceptual tasks but consistently underperform in understanding and planning tasks, particularly in numerical estimation, multi-view reasoning, temporal dynamics, and spatial imagination. These findings underscore the substantial challenges that remain in achieving spatial intelligence, while providing both a systematic roadmap and a comprehensive benchmark to drive future research in the field.

        "summary": "We present LongCat-Flash-Thinking, an efficient 560-billion-parameter open-source Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) reasoning model. Its advanced capabilities are cultivated through a meticulously crafted training process, beginning with long Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data cold-start and culminating in large-scale Reinforcement Learning (RL). We first employ a well-designed cold-start training strategy, which significantly enhances the reasoning potential and equips the model with specialized skills in both formal and agentic reasoning. Then, a core innovation is our domain-parallel training scheme, which decouples optimization across distinct domains (e.g., STEM, Code, Agentic) and subsequently fuses the resulting expert models into a single, nearly Pareto-optimal model. This entire process is powered by our Dynamic ORchestration for Asynchronous rollout (DORA) system, a large-scale RL framework that delivers a greater than threefold training speedup over synchronous methods on tens of thousands of accelerators. As a result, LongCat-Flash-Thinking achieves state-of-the-art performance among open-source models on a suite of complex reasoning tasks. The model exhibits exceptional efficiency in agentic reasoning, reducing average token consumption by 64.5% (from 19, 653 to 6, 965) on AIME-25, without degrading task accuracy. We release LongCat-Flash-Thinking to promote further advances in reasoning systems and agentic AI research.",

        "summary": "Under a unified operational definition, we define LLM memory as a persistent state written during pretraining, finetuning, or inference that can later be addressed and that stably influences outputs. We propose a four-part taxonomy (parametric, contextual, external, procedural/episodic) and a memory quadruple (location, persistence, write/access path, controllability). We link mechanism, evaluation, and governance via the chain write -> read -> inhibit/update. To avoid distorted comparisons across heterogeneous setups, we adopt a three-setting protocol (parametric only, offline retrieval, online retrieval) that decouples capability from information availability on the same data and timeline. On this basis we build a layered evaluation: parametric (closed-book recall, edit differential, memorization/privacy), contextual (position curves and the mid-sequence drop), external (answer correctness vs snippet attribution/faithfulness), and procedural/episodic (cross-session consistency and timeline replay, E MARS+). The framework integrates temporal governance and leakage auditing (freshness hits, outdated answers, refusal slices) and uncertainty reporting via inter-rater agreement plus paired tests with multiple-comparison correction. For updating and forgetting, we present DMM Gov: coordinating DAPT/TAPT, PEFT, model editing (ROME, MEND, MEMIT, SERAC), and RAG to form an auditable loop covering admission thresholds, rollout, monitoring, rollback, and change audits, with specs for timeliness, conflict handling, and long-horizon consistency. Finally, we give four testable propositions: minimum identifiability; a minimal evaluation card; causally constrained editing with verifiable forgetting; and when retrieval with small-window replay outperforms ultra-long-context reading. This yields a reproducible, comparable, and governable coordinate system for research and deployment.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a promising avenue for user profiling, yet the progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive benchmarks. To bridge this gap, we propose ProfileBench, an industrial benchmark derived from a real-world video platform, encompassing heterogeneous user data and a well-structured profiling taxonomy. However, the profiling task remains challenging due to the difficulty of collecting large-scale ground-truth labels, and the heterogeneous and noisy user information can compromise the reliability of LLMs. To approach label-free and reliable user profiling, we propose a Confidence-driven Profile reasoning framework Conf-Profile, featuring a two-stage paradigm. We first synthesize high-quality labels by leveraging advanced LLMs with confidence hints, followed by confidence-weighted voting for accuracy improvement and confidence calibration for a balanced distribution. The multiple profile results, rationales, and confidence scores are aggregated and distilled into a lightweight LLM. We further enhance the reasoning ability via confidence-guided unsupervised reinforcement learning, which exploits confidence for difficulty filtering, quasi-ground truth voting, and reward weighting. Experimental results demonstrate that Conf-Profile delivers substantial performance through the two-stage training, improving F1 by 13.97 on Qwen3-8B.",

However, existing explorations encounter both advantage reversion and advantage mirror problems, which hinder the reasonable advantage allocation across different query samples. In this work, we propose an easy but effective GRPO strategy, Mixed Advantage Policy Optimization (MAPO). We reveal that the trajectory appears with different certainty and propose the advantage percent deviation for samples with high-certainty trajectories. Furthermore, we dynamically reweight the advantage function for samples with varying trajectory certainty, thereby adaptively configuring the advantage function to account for sample-specific characteristics. Comparison with related state-of-the-art methods, along with ablation studies on different advantage variants, validates the effectiveness of our approach.",

Although large language models (LLMs) show promise in automating ICD coding, their challenges in base model selection, input contextualization, and training data redundancy limit their effectiveness. We propose a modular framework for ICD-10 Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM) code prediction that addresses these challenges through principled model selection, redundancy-aware data sampling, and structured input design. The framework integrates an LLM-as-judge evaluation protocol with Plackett-Luce aggregation to assess and rank open-source LLMs based on their intrinsic comprehension of ICD-10-CM code definitions. We introduced embedding-based similarity measures, a redundancy-aware sampling strategy to remove semantically duplicated discharge summaries. We leverage structured discharge summaries from Taiwanese hospitals to evaluate contextual effects and examine section-wise content inclusion under universal and section-specific modelling paradigms. Experiments across two institutional datasets demonstrate that the selected base model after fine-tuning consistently outperforms baseline LLMs in internal and external evaluations. Incorporating more clinical sections consistently improves prediction performance. This study uses open-source LLMs to establish a practical and principled approach to ICD-10-CM code prediction. The proposed framework provides a scalable, institution-ready solution for real-world deployment of automated medical coding systems by combining informed model selection, efficient data refinement, and context-aware prompting.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we introduce LLMCHECKER, a model-checking-based verification method to verify the probabilistic computation tree logic (PCTL) properties of an LLM text generation process. We empirically show that only a limited number of tokens are typically chosen during text generation, which are not always the same. This insight drives the creation of $\\alpha$-$k$-bounded text generation, narrowing the focus to the $\\alpha$ maximal cumulative probability on the top-$k$ tokens at every step of the text generation process. Our verification method considers an initial string and the subsequent top-$k$ tokens while accommodating diverse text quantification methods, such as evaluating text quality and biases. The threshold $\\alpha$ further reduces the selected tokens, only choosing those that exceed or meet it in cumulative probability. LLMCHECKER then allows us to formally verify the PCTL properties of $\\alpha$-$k$-bounded LLMs. We demonstrate the applicability of our method in several LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Mistral, Genstruct, and BERT. To our knowledge, this is the first time PCTL-based model checking has been used to check the consistency of the LLM text generation process.",

It reuses mature OCI / ORAS infrastructure for artifact distribution, integrates Sigstore for provenance, and supports schema-driven extensibility for emerging agent modalities (LLM prompt agents, MCP servers, A2A-enabled components).

We propose experience scaling, a framework for continuous post-deployment evolution for LLMs through autonomous interaction with the environment and collaborative sharing of accumulated experience. The framework captures raw interactions, distills them into compact, reusable knowledge, and periodically refines stored content to preserve relevance and efficiency. We validate the framework in simulated real-world scenarios involving generalization to previously unseen but related tasks, repetitive queries, and over-saturated knowledge stores. Across all settings, experience scaling improves accuracy, sustains performance over time, and maintains gains when applied to novel situations. These results demonstrate that structured post-deployment learning can extend LLM capabilities beyond the limits of static human-generated data, offering a scalable path for continued intelligence progress.",

        "summary": "As data continues to grow in scale and complexity, preparing, transforming, and analyzing it remains labor-intensive, repetitive, and difficult to scale. Since data contains knowledge and AI learns knowledge from it, the alignment between AI and data is essential. However, data is often not structured in ways that are optimal for AI utilization. Moreover, an important question arises: how much knowledge can we pack into data through intensive data operations? Autonomous data agents (DataAgents), which integrate LLM reasoning with task decomposition, action reasoning and grounding, and tool calling, can autonomously interpret data task descriptions, decompose tasks into subtasks, reason over actions, ground actions into python code or tool calling, and execute operations. Unlike traditional data management and engineering tools, DataAgents dynamically plan workflows, call powerful tools, and adapt to diverse data tasks at scale. This report argues that DataAgents represent a paradigm shift toward autonomous data-to-knowledge systems. DataAgents are capable of handling collection, integration, preprocessing, selection, transformation, reweighing, augmentation, reprogramming, repairs, and retrieval. Through these capabilities, DataAgents transform complex and unstructured data into coherent and actionable knowledge. We first examine why the convergence of agentic AI and data-to-knowledge systems has emerged as a critical trend. We then define the concept of DataAgents and discuss their architectural design, training strategies, as well as the new skills and capabilities they enable. Finally, we call for concerted efforts to advance action workflow optimization, establish open datasets and benchmark ecosystems, safeguard privacy, balance efficiency with scalability, and develop trustworthy DataAgent guardrails to prevent malicious actions.",

Our framework combines Mesa-based spatial modelling with CLIMADA climate impact assessment, introducing adaptive learning behaviours that allow firms to evolve strategies for budget allocation, pricing, wages, and risk adaptation through fitness-based selection and mutation. We demonstrate the framework using riverine flood projections under RCP8.5 until 2100, showing that evolutionary adaptation enables firms to converge with baseline (no hazard) production levels after decades of disruption due to climate stress. Our results reveal systemic risks where even agents that are not directly exposed to floods face impacts through supply chain disruptions, with the end-of-century average price of goods 5.6% higher under RCP8.5 compared to the baseline. This open-source framework provides financial institutions and companies with tools to quantify both direct and cascading climate risks while evaluating cost-effective adaptation strategies.",

However, LLMs often find Math Word Problems (MWPs) challenging because solving them requires a range of reasoning and mathematical abilities with which LLMs seem to struggle. Recent efforts have helped LLMs solve more complex MWPs with improved prompts. This study proposes a novel method that initially prompts an LLM to create equations from a decomposition of the question, followed by using an external symbolic equation solver to produce an answer. To ensure the accuracy of the obtained answer, inspired by an established recommendation of math teachers, the LLM is instructed to solve the MWP a second time, but this time with the objective of estimating the correct answer instead of solving it exactly. The estimation is then compared to the generated answer to verify. If verification fails, an iterative rectification process is employed to ensure the correct answer is eventually found. This approach achieves new state-of-the-art results on datasets used by prior published research on numeric and algebraic MWPs, improving the previous best results by nearly two percent on average. In addition, the approach obtains satisfactory results on trigonometric MWPs, a task not previously attempted to the authors' best knowledge. This study also introduces two new datasets, SVAMPClean and Trig300, to further advance the testing of LLMs' reasoning abilities.",

        "summary": "Compared to traditional models, agentic AI represents a highly valuable target for potential attackers as they possess privileged access to data sources and API tools, which are traditionally not incorporated into classical agents. Unlike a typical software application residing in a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ), agentic LLMs consciously rely on nondeterministic behavior of the AI (only defining a final goal, leaving the path selection to LLM). This characteristic introduces substantial security risk to both operational security and information security. Most common existing defense mechanism rely on detection of malicious intent and preventing it from reaching the LLM agent, thus protecting against jailbreak attacks such as prompt injection. In this paper, we present an alternative approach, LLMZ+, which moves beyond traditional detection-based approaches by implementing prompt whitelisting. Through this method, only contextually appropriate and safe messages are permitted to interact with the agentic LLM. By leveraging the specificity of context, LLMZ+ guarantees that all exchanges between external users and the LLM conform to predefined use cases and operational boundaries. Our approach streamlines the security framework, enhances its long-term resilience, and reduces the resources required for sustaining LLM information security. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates that LLMZ+ provides strong resilience against the most common jailbreak prompts. At the same time, legitimate business communications are not disrupted, and authorized traffic flows seamlessly between users and the agentic LLM. We measure the effectiveness of approach using false positive and false negative rates, both of which can be reduced to 0 in our experimental setting.",

FERA extracts 2D joint positions from video, normalizes them, computes a 101-dimensional kinematic feature set, and applies a Transformer for multi-label move and blade classification. To determine priority and scoring, FERA applies a distilled language model with encoded right-of-way rules, producing both a decision and an explanation for each exchange. With limited hand-labeled data, a 5-fold cross-validation achieves an average macro-F1 score of 0.549, outperforming multiple baselines, including a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), BiLSTM, and a vanilla Transformer.

This unreliability renders \"out-of-the-box\" GPT unsuitable for deployment in education or engineering practice.

Agency first launches N instantiations of Agent Solve to yield N independent Proposed Problem Solution Realizations; Agency then invokes Agent Compare to summarize and compare the N Proposed Problem Solution Realizations and to provide a Recommended Problem Solution. We argue from Condorcet's Jury Theorem that, for a Problem Statement characterized by per-Solve success probability greater than 1/2 (and N sufficiently large), the Predominant (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solution will, with high probability, correspond to a Correct Proposed Problem Solution. Furthermore, Agent Compare can also incorporate aspects of Secondary (Agent Compare) Proposed Problem Solutions, in particular when the latter represent alternative Problem Statement interpretations - different Mathematical Models - or alternative Mathematical Solution Procedures.

We define: (1) a similarity field $S: U \\times U \\to [0,1]$ over a universe of entities $U$, satisfying reflexivity $S(E,E)=1$ and treated as a directed relational field (asymmetry and non-transitivity are allowed); (2) the evolution of a system through a sequence $Z_p = (X_p, S^{(p)})$ indexed by $p=0,1,2,\\ldots$; (3) concepts $K$ as entities that induce fibers $F_{\\alpha}(K) = { E \\in U \\mid S(E,K) \\ge \\alpha }$, i.e., superlevel sets of the unary map $S_K(E) := S(E,K)$; and (4) a generative operator $G$ that produces new entities. Within this framework, we formalize a generative definition of intelligence: an operator $G$ is intelligent with respect to a concept $K$ if, given a system containing entities belonging to the fiber of $K$, it generates new entities that also belong to that fiber. Similarity Field Theory thus offers a foundational language for characterizing, comparing, and constructing intelligent systems. We prove two theorems: (i) asymmetry blocks mutual inclusion; and (ii) stability requires either an anchor coordinate or eventual confinement within a level set of $f$. These results ensure that the evolution of similarity fields is both constrained and interpretable, culminating in an exploration of how the framework allows us to interpret large language models and use them as experimental probes into societal cognition.",

When drawing conclusions from a QBAF and updating the QBAF to then again draw conclusions (and so on), our approach traces changes -- which we call strength inconsistencies -- in the partial order over argument strengths that a semantics establishes on some arguments of interest, called topic arguments. We trace the causes of strength inconsistencies to specific arguments, which then serve as explanations. We identify sufficient, necessary, and counterfactual explanations for strength inconsistencies and show that strength inconsistency explanations exist if and only if an update leads to strength inconsistency. We define a heuristic-based approach to facilitate the search for strength inconsistency explanations, for which we also provide an implementation.",

        "summary": "Autonomous systems have advanced significantly, but challenges persist in accident-prone environments where robust decision-making is crucial. A single vehicle's limited sensor range and obstructed views increase the likelihood of accidents. Multi-vehicle connected systems and multi-modal approaches, leveraging RGB images and LiDAR point clouds, have emerged as promising solutions. However, existing methods often assume the availability of all data modalities and connected vehicles during both training and testing, which is impractical due to potential sensor failures or missing connected vehicles. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel framework MMCD (Multi-Modal Collaborative Decision-making) for connected autonomy. Our framework fuses multi-modal observations from ego and collaborative vehicles to enhance decision-making under challenging conditions. To ensure robust performance when certain data modalities are unavailable during testing, we propose an approach based on cross-modal knowledge distillation with a teacher-student model structure. The teacher model is trained with multiple data modalities, while the student model is designed to operate effectively with reduced modalities. In experiments on $\\textit{connected autonomous driving with ground vehicles}$ and $\\textit{aerial-ground vehicles collaboration}$, our method improves driving safety by up to ${\\it 20.7}\\%$, surpassing the best-existing baseline in detecting potential accidents and making safe driving decisions.

We introduce OBER-an Outcome-Based Educational Recommender that embeds learning outcomes and assessment items directly into the data schema, so any algorithm can be evaluated on the mastery it fosters. OBER uses a minimalist entity-relation model, a log-driven mastery formula, and a plug-in architecture. Integrated into an e-learning system in non-formal domain, it was evaluated trough a two-week randomized split test with over 5 700 learners across three methods: fixed expert trajectory, collaborative filtering (CF), and knowledge-based (KB) filtering. CF maximized retention, but the fixed path achieved the highest mastery. Because OBER derives business, relevance, and learning metrics from the same logs, it lets practitioners weigh relevance and engagement against outcome mastery with no extra testing overhead. The framework is method-agnostic and readily extensible to future adaptive or context-aware recommenders.",

Traditional approaches, which depend on expert-based modeling and manual parameter adjustment, often face challenges in handling large-scale, dynamic, and multi-constraint problems. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown potential to address these limitations through semantic understanding, structured generation, and reasoning control. LLMs can translate natural language descriptions into mathematical models or executable code, generate heuristics, evolve algorithms, and directly tackle optimization tasks. This paper surveys recent progress on the integration of LLMs into OR, organizing methods into three main directions: automatic modeling, auxiliary optimization, and direct solving. It further reviews evaluation benchmarks and domain-specific applications, and summarizes key open issues such as unstable semantic-to-structure mapping, fragmented research progress, limited generalization, and insufficient evaluation systems. Finally, the survey outlines possible research avenues for advancing the role of LLMs in OR.",

Existing XAI works focus on interpreting model predictions but do not capture the confidence or reliability of these predictions. Conversely, uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques provide confidence measures but lack intuitive explanations. The disconnect between these two areas limits AI adoption in medicine. To address this gap, we propose Explainable Uncertainty Estimation (XUE) that integrates explainability with uncertainty quantification to enhance trust and usability in medical AI. We systematically map medical uncertainty to AI uncertainty concepts and identify key challenges in implementing XUE. We outline technical directions for advancing XUE, including multimodal uncertainty quantification, model-agnostic visualization techniques, and uncertainty-aware decision support systems. Lastly, we propose guiding principles to ensure effective XUE realisation. Our analysis highlights the need for AI systems that not only generate reliable predictions but also articulate confidence levels in a clinically meaningful way.

To characterize its use in real-world settings, we conducted interviews with defenders (e.g., factcheckers, journalists, officials) in Taiwan and creators (e.g., influencers, political consultants, advertisers) as well as defenders in India, centering two places characterized by high levels of online propaganda. The term \"deepfakes\", we find, exerts outsized discursive power in shaping defenders' expectations of misuse and, in turn, the interventions that are prioritized. To better characterize the space of generative propaganda, we develop a taxonomy that distinguishes between obvious versus hidden and promotional versus derogatory use. Deception was neither the main driver nor the main impact vector of AI's use; instead, Indian creators sought to persuade rather than to deceive, often making AI's use obvious in order to reduce legal and reputational risks, while Taiwan's defenders saw deception as a subset of broader efforts to distort the prevalence of strategic narratives online. AI was useful and used, however, in producing efficiency gains in communicating across languages and modes, and in evading human and algorithmic detection. Security researchers should reconsider threat models to clearly differentiate deepfakes from promotional and obvious uses, to complement and bolster the social factors that constrain misuse by internal actors, and to counter efficiency gains globally.",

        "summary": "The use of natural language (NL) test cases for validating graphical user interface (GUI) applications is emerging as a promising direction to manually written executable test scripts, which are costly to develop and difficult to maintain. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened the possibility of the direct execution of NL test cases by LLM agents. This paper investigates this direction, focusing on the impact on NL test case unsoundness and on test case execution consistency. NL test cases are inherently unsound, as they may yield false failures due to ambiguous instructions or unpredictable agent behaviour. Furthermore, repeated executions of the same NL test case may lead to inconsistent outcomes, undermining test reliability. To address these challenges, we propose an algorithm for executing NL test cases with guardrail mechanisms and specialised agents that dynamically verify the correct execution of each test step. We introduce measures to evaluate the capabilities of LLMs in test execution and one measure to quantify execution consistency. We propose a definition of weak unsoundness to characterise contexts in which NL test case execution remains acceptable, with respect to the industrial quality levels Six Sigma. Our experimental evaluation with eight publicly available LLMs, ranging from 3B to 70B parameters, demonstrates both the potential and current limitations of current LLM agents for GUI testing. Our experiments show that Meta Llama 3.1 70B demonstrates acceptable capabilities in NL test case execution with high execution consistency (above the level 3-sigma).

We run 19 pre-registered studies on a national U.S. panel and their LLM-powered digital twins (constructed based on previously-collected extensive individual-level data) and compare twin and human answers across 164 outcomes. The correlation between twin and human answers is modest (approximately 0.2 on average) and twin responses are less variable than human responses. While constructing digital twins based on rich individual-level data improves our ability to capture heterogeneity across participants and predict relative differences between them, it does not substantially improve our ability to predict the exact answers given by specific participants or enhance predictions of population means. Twin performance varies by domain and is higher among more educated, higher-income, and ideologically moderate participants. These results suggest current digital twins can capture some degree of relative differences but are unreliable for individual-level predictions and sample mean and variance estimation, underscoring the need for careful validation before use.

        "summary": "Robotic manipulation policies are commonly initialized through imitation learning, but their performance is limited by the scarcity and narrow coverage of expert data. Reinforcement learning can refine polices to alleviate this limitation, yet real-robot training is costly and unsafe, while training in simulators suffers from the sim-to-real gap. Recent advances in generative models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in real-world simulation, with diffusion models in particular excelling at generation. This raises the question of how diffusion model-based world models can be combined to enhance pre-trained policies in robotic manipulation. In this work, we propose World4RL, a framework that employs diffusion-based world models as high-fidelity simulators to refine pre-trained policies entirely in imagined environments for robotic manipulation. Unlike prior works that primarily employ world models for planning, our framework enables direct end-to-end policy optimization. World4RL is designed around two principles: pre-training a diffusion world model that captures diverse dynamics on multi-task datasets and refining policies entirely within a frozen world model to avoid online real-world interactions. We further design a two-hot action encoding scheme tailored for robotic manipulation and adopt diffusion backbones to improve modeling fidelity. Extensive simulation and real-world experiments demonstrate that World4RL provides high-fidelity environment modeling and enables consistent policy refinement, yielding significantly higher success rates compared to imitation learning and other baselines.

To bridge this gap, we propose Eva-VLA, the first unified framework that systematically evaluates the robustness of VLA models by transforming discrete physical variations into continuous optimization problems. However, comprehensively assessing VLA robustness presents two key challenges: (1) how to systematically characterize diverse physical variations encountered in real-world deployments while maintaining evaluation reproducibility, and (2) how to discover worst-case scenarios without prohibitive real-world data collection costs efficiently. To address the first challenge, we decompose real-world variations into three critical domains: object 3D transformations that affect spatial reasoning, illumination variations that challenge visual perception, and adversarial patches that disrupt scene understanding. For the second challenge, we introduce a continuous black-box optimization framework that transforms discrete physical variations into parameter optimization, enabling systematic exploration of worst-case scenarios. Extensive experiments on state-of-the-art OpenVLA models across multiple benchmarks reveal alarming vulnerabilities: all variation types trigger failure rates exceeding 60%, with object transformations causing up to 97.8% failure in long-horizon tasks. Our findings expose critical gaps between controlled laboratory success and unpredictable deployment readiness, while the Eva-VLA framework provides a practical pathway for hardening VLA-based robotic manipulation models against real-world deployment challenges.",

Through an analysis of publications (2021-2024), we explore (1) how AIL is defined and conceptualized in current research, particularly in HE, and how it can be delineated from related concepts such as Data Literacy, Media Literacy, and Computational Literacy; (2) how various definitions can be synthesized into a comprehensive working definition, and (3) how scientific insights can be effectively translated into educational practice. Our analysis identifies seven central dimensions of AIL: technical, applicational, critical thinking, ethical, social, integrational, and legal. These are synthesized in the AI Literacy Heptagon, deepening conceptual understanding and supporting the structured development of AIL in HE.

We introduce a multi-stage auditing framework to investigate these risks. First, a large-scale audit of over 435,000 ad impressions delivered to 891 Australian Facebook users reveals algorithmic biases, including disproportionate Gambling and Politics ads shown to socioeconomically vulnerable and politically aligned groups. Second, a multimodal LLM can reconstruct users' demographic profiles from ad streams, outperforming census-based baselines and matching or exceeding human performance. Our results provide the first empirical evidence that ad streams constitute rich digital footprints for public AI inference, highlighting urgent privacy risks and the need for content-level auditing and governance.",

While existing approaches mainly focus on policy design, they often neglect the structure and capacity of visual encoders, limiting spatial understanding and generalization. Inspired by biological vision systems, which rely on both visual and proprioceptive cues for robust control, we propose VGGT-DP, a visuomotor policy framework that integrates geometric priors from a pretrained 3D perception model with proprioceptive feedback. We adopt the Visual Geometry Grounded Transformer (VGGT) as the visual encoder and introduce a proprioception-guided visual learning strategy to align perception with internal robot states, improving spatial grounding and closed-loop control. To reduce inference latency, we design a frame-wise token reuse mechanism that compacts multi-view tokens into an efficient spatial representation. We further apply random token pruning to enhance policy robustness and reduce overfitting. Experiments on challenging MetaWorld tasks show that VGGT-DP significantly outperforms strong baselines such as DP and DP3, particularly in precision-critical and long-horizon scenarios.",

        "summary": "Neural network models capable of storing memory have been extensively studied in computer science and computational neuroscience. The Hopfield network is a prototypical example of a model designed for associative, or content-addressable, memory and has been analyzed in many forms. Further, ideas and methods from complex network theory have been incorporated into artificial neural networks and learning, emphasizing their structural properties. Nevertheless, the temporal dynamics also play a vital role in biological neural networks, whose temporal structure is a crucial feature to examine. Biological neural networks display complex intermittency and, thus, can be studied through the lens of the temporal complexity (TC) theory. The TC approach look at the metastability of self-organized states, characterized by a power-law decay in the inter-event time distribution and in the total activity distribution or a scaling behavior in the corresponding event-driven diffusion processes. In this study, we present a temporal complexity (TC) analysis of a biologically-inspired Hopfield-type neural network model. We conducted a comparative assessment between scale-free and random network topologies, with particular emphasis on their global activation patterns. Our parametric analysis revealed comparable dynamical behaviors across both neural network architectures. Furthermore, our investigation into temporal complexity characteristics uncovered that seemingly distinct dynamical patterns exhibit similar temporal complexity behaviors. In particular, similar power-law decay in the activity distribution and similar complexity levels are observed in both topologies, but with a much reduced noise in the scale-free topology. Notably, most of the complex dynamical profiles were consistently observed in scale-free network configurations, thus confirming the crucial role of hubs in neural network dynamics.",

However, this promise is contingent on the availability of diverse, high-quality datasets, which are not only challenging and costly to collect but are often constrained to a specific robot embodiment. Portable handheld grippers have recently emerged as intuitive and scalable alternatives to traditional robotic teleoperation methods for data collection. However, their reliance solely on first-person view wrist-mounted cameras often creates limitations in capturing sufficient scene contexts. In this paper, we present MV-UMI (Multi-View Universal Manipulation Interface), a framework that integrates a third-person perspective with the egocentric camera to overcome this limitation. This integration mitigates domain shifts between human demonstration and robot deployment, preserving the cross-embodiment advantages of handheld data-collection devices. Our experimental results, including an ablation study, demonstrate that our MV-UMI framework improves performance in sub-tasks requiring broad scene understanding by approximately 47% across 3 tasks, confirming the effectiveness of our approach in expanding the range of feasible manipulation tasks that can be learned using handheld gripper systems, without compromising the cross-embodiment advantages inherent to such systems.",

One such self-supervised learning approach is masked spectrogram modeling, where the objective is to learn semantically rich contextual representations by predicting removed or hidden portions of the input audio spectrogram. With the Transformer neural architecture at its core, masked spectrogram modeling has emerged as the prominent approach for learning general purpose audio representations, a.k.a. audio foundation models. Meanwhile, addressing the issues of the Transformer architecture, in particular the underlying Scaled Dot-product Attention operation, which scales quadratically with input sequence length, has led to renewed interest in recurrent sequence modeling approaches. Among them, Selective structured state space models (such as Mamba) and extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) are the two most promising approaches which have experienced widespread adoption. While the body of work on these two topics continues to grow, there is currently a lack of an adequate overview encompassing the intersection of these topics. In this paper, we present a comprehensive overview of the aforementioned research domains, covering masked spectrogram modeling and the previously mentioned neural sequence modeling architectures, Mamba and xLSTM. Further, we compare Transformers, Mamba and xLSTM based masked spectrogram models in a unified, reproducible framework on ten diverse downstream audio classification tasks, which will help interested readers to make informed decisions regarding suitability of the evaluated approaches to adjacent applications.",

Users specify objects via natural language and receive continuous spatial feedback to navigate toward the target without needing prior setup.

Simulators provide safe, scalable training environments, but the inevitable sim-to-real gap introduces additional safety concerns, as policies must satisfy constraints in real-world conditions that differ from simulation. To address this challenge, robust safe RL techniques offer principled methods, but are often incompatible with standard scalable training pipelines. In contrast, domain randomization, a simple and popular sim-to-real technique, stands out as a promising alternative, although it often results in unsafe behaviors in practice. We present SPiDR, short for Sim-to-real via Pessimistic Domain Randomization -- a scalable algorithm with provable guarantees for safe sim-to-real transfer. SPiDR uses domain randomization to incorporate the uncertainty about the sim-to-real gap into the safety constraints, making it versatile and highly compatible with existing training pipelines. Through extensive experiments on sim-to-sim benchmarks and two distinct real-world robotic platforms, we demonstrate that SPiDR effectively ensures safety despite the sim-to-real gap while maintaining strong performance.",

However, in this study, we find that this common practice makes the policy overly reliant on the proprioceptive state input, which causes overfitting to the training trajectories and results in poor spatial generalization. On the contrary, we propose the State-free Policy, removing the proprioceptive state input and predicting actions only conditioned on visual observations. The State-free Policy is built in the relative end-effector action space, and should ensure the full task-relevant visual observations, here provided by dual wide-angle wrist cameras. Empirical results demonstrate that the State-free policy achieves significantly stronger spatial generalization than the state-based policy: in real-world tasks such as pick-and-place, challenging shirt-folding, and complex whole-body manipulation, spanning multiple robot embodiments, the average success rate improves from 0\\% to 85\\% in height generalization and from 6\\% to 64\\% in horizontal generalization.

While simulated data offers a scalable alternative, particularly with advances in automated demonstration generation, transferring policies to the real world is hampered by various simulation and real domain gaps. In this work, we propose a unified sim-and-real co-training framework for learning generalizable manipulation policies that primarily leverages simulation and only requires a few real-world demonstrations. Central to our approach is learning a domain-invariant, task-relevant feature space. Our key insight is that aligning the joint distributions of observations and their corresponding actions across domains provides a richer signal than aligning observations (marginals) alone. We achieve this by embedding an Optimal Transport (OT)-inspired loss within the co-training framework, and extend this to an Unbalanced OT framework to handle the imbalance between abundant simulation data and limited real-world examples. We validate our method on challenging manipulation tasks, showing it can leverage abundant simulation data to achieve up to a 30% improvement in the real-world success rate and even generalize to scenarios seen only in simulation.",

We address these challenges by normalizing crash narratives to ego-centric language and converting both logs and crashes into a unified scene-action representation suitable for retrieval. At decision time, our system adjudicates proposed actions by retrieving relevant precedents from this unified index; an agentic counterfactual extension proposes plausible alternatives, retrieves for each, and reasons across outcomes before deciding. On a nuScenes benchmark, precedent retrieval substantially improves calibration, with recall on contextually preferred actions rising from 24% to 53%.

They cannot process free-text sound queries, which enable more flexible and user-friendly interaction, and they lack zero-shot capabilities and offer poor few-shot adaptability. Although text-query-based separation methods have been explored, they primarily focus on source separation and are ill-suited for SED tasks that require precise temporal localization and efficient detection across large and diverse sound vocabularies. In this paper, we propose FlexSED, an open-vocabulary sound event detection system. FlexSED builds on a pretrained audio SSL model and the CLAP text encoder, introducing an encoder-decoder composition and an adaptive fusion strategy to enable effective continuous training from pretrained weights. To ensure robust supervision, it also employs large language models (LLMs) to assist in event query selection during training, addressing challenges related to missing labels. As a result, FlexSED achieves superior performance compared to vanilla SED models on AudioSet-Strong, while demonstrating strong zero-shot and few-shot capabilities. We release the code and pretrained models to support future research and applications based on FlexSED.",

Our research examines how instruction-following capabilities in LLMs interact with multi-document comparison tasks, identifying what we term the \"Ranking Blind Spot\", a characteristic of LLM decision processes during comparative evaluation. We analyze how this ranking blind spot affects LLM evaluation systems through two approaches: Decision Objective Hijacking, which alters the evaluation goal in pairwise ranking systems, and Decision Criteria Hijacking, which modifies relevance standards across ranking schemes. These approaches demonstrate how content providers could potentially influence LLM-based ranking systems to affect document positioning. These attacks aim to force the LLM ranker to prefer a specific passage and rank it at the top. Malicious content providers can exploit this weakness, which helps them gain additional exposure by attacking the ranker. In our experiment, We empirically show that the proposed attacks are effective in various LLMs and can be generalized to multiple ranking schemes. We apply these attack to realistic examples to show their effectiveness. We also found stronger LLMs are more vulnerable to these attacks.

        "summary": "In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have played an important role in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) systems. While reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly enhanced LLM performance in text-based tasks, its application to ASR and TTS remains underexplored due to the complexity of training audio-based models. In this study, we propose a lightweight RL framework tailored for audio-based LLMs that can process audio inputs and generate audio outputs. Based on this framework, we evaluate the effectiveness of reinforcement learning on both ASR and TTS tasks. For the ASR task, we experiment with different rule-based reward functions within the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) framework and investigate the impact of RL data construction. For the TTS task, we compare GRPO with Differentiable Reward Optimization (DiffRO) and further combine the two approaches to achieve improved performance. Our experiments demonstrate that RL can significantly enhance the performance of both ASR and TTS systems, even with limited training data and a small number of optimization steps.",

To make up for this loss, this research reconstructs a new dataset PCLMMPLUS that includes 103k comment entries and expands the dataset size. We also propose the CPCLDetector model with alignment selection and knowledge-enhanced comment content modules. Extensive experiments show the proposed CPCLDetector outperforms the SOTA on PCLMM and achieves higher performance on PCLMMPLUS .

However, previous DoA-based methods rely on hand-crafted features or discrete encodings, which lose fine-grained spatial information and limit adaptability. We propose SoundCompass, an effective directional clue integration framework centered on a Spectral Pairwise INteraction (SPIN) module that captures cross-channel spatial correlations in the complex spectrogram domain to preserve full spatial information in multichannel signals. The input feature expressed in terms of spatial correlations is fused with a DoA clue represented as spherical harmonics (SH) encoding. The fusion is carried out across overlapping frequency subbands, inheriting the benefits reported in the previous band-split architectures. We also incorporate the iterative refinement strategy, chain-of-inference (CoI), in the TSE framework, which recursively fuses DoA with sound event activation estimated from the previous inference stage. Experiments demonstrate that SoundCompass, combining SPIN, SH embedding, and CoI, robustly extracts target sources across diverse signal classes and spatial configurations.",

        "summary": "Physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) requires robots to adapt to individual contact preferences, such as where and how much force is applied. Identifying preferences is difficult for a single contact; with whole-arm interaction involving multiple simultaneous contacts between the robot and human, the challenge is greater because different body parts can impose incompatible force requirements. In caregiving tasks, where contact is frequent and varied, such conflicts are unavoidable. With multiple preferences across multiple contacts, no single solution can satisfy all objectives--trade-offs are inherent, making prioritization essential. We present PrioriTouch, a framework for ranking and executing control objectives across multiple contacts. PrioriTouch can prioritize from a general collection of controllers, making it applicable not only to caregiving scenarios such as bed bathing and dressing but also to broader multi-contact settings. Our method combines a novel learning-to-rank approach with hierarchical operational space control, leveraging simulation-in-the-loop rollouts for data-efficient and safe exploration. We conduct a user study on physical assistance preferences, derive personalized comfort thresholds, and incorporate them into PrioriTouch. We evaluate PrioriTouch through extensive simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating its ability to adapt to user contact preferences, maintain task performance, and enhance safety and comfort.

The majority of these approaches have been based on supervised learning that is always challenged in occasions where training data is limited. More recently, there has been a growing interest in potentials of pre-trained self-supervised audio foundation models for biomedical end tasks. Despite exhibiting promising results, these foundational models are typically computationally intensive. Within the context of automatic cardiac auscultation, this study explores a lightweight alternative to these general-purpose audio foundation models by introducing the Scattering Transformer, a novel, training-free transformer architecture for heart murmur detection. The proposed method leverages standard wavelet scattering networks by introducing contextual dependencies in a transformer-like architecture without any backpropagation. We evaluate our approach on the public CirCor DigiScope dataset, directly comparing it against leading general-purpose foundational models. The Scattering Transformer achieves a Weighted Accuracy(WAR) of 0.786 and an Unweighted Average Recall(UAR) of 0.697, demonstrating performance highly competitive with contemporary state of the art methods. This study establishes the Scattering Transformer as a viable and promising alternative in resource-constrained setups.",

We extend the A2A paradigm [1 , 2] by introducing a cryptographically grounded mechanism for lineage verification, wherein the provenance and evolution of NHIs are anchored in append-only Merkle tree structures modeled after Certificate Transparency (CT) logs. Unlike traditional A2A models that primarily secure point-to-point interactions, our approach enables both agents and external verifiers to cryptographically validate multi-hop provenance, thereby ensuring the integrity of the entire call chain. A federated proof server acts as an auditor across one or more Merkle logs, aggregating inclusion proofs and consistency checks into compact, signed attestations that external parties can verify without access to the full execution trace. In parallel, we augment the A2A agent card to incorporate explicit identity verification primitives, enabling both peer agents and human approvers to authenticate the legitimacy of NHI representations in a standardized manner. Together, these contributions establish a cohesive model that integrates identity attestation, lineage verification, and independent proof auditing, thereby advancing the security posture of inter-agent ecosystems and providing a foundation for robust governance of NHIs in regulated environments such as FedRAMP.",

Using a custom simulation testbed with stochastic traffic agents, pedestrians, occlusions, and adversarial scenarios, we evaluate four decision-making approaches: a deterministic finite state machine (FSM), and three probabilistic planners: QMDP, POMCP, and DESPOT. Results show that probabilistic planners outperform the rule-based baseline, achieving up to 97.5 percent collision-free navigation under partial observability, with POMCP prioritizing safety and DESPOT balancing efficiency and runtime feasibility. Our findings highlight the importance of uncertainty-aware planning for driver assistance and motivate future integration of sensor fusion and environment perception modules for real-time deployment in realistic traffic environments.",

        "summary": "Artificial intelligence risks are multidimensional in nature, as the same risk scenarios may have legal, operational, and financial risk dimensions. With the emergence of new AI regulations, the state of the art of artificial intelligence risk management seems to be highly immature due to upcoming AI regulations. Despite the appearance of several methodologies and generic criteria, it is rare to find guidelines with real implementation value, considering that the most important issue is customizing artificial intelligence risk metrics and risk models for specific AI risk scenarios. Furthermore, the financial departments, legal departments and Government Risk Compliance teams seem to remain unaware of many technical aspects of AI systems, in which data scientists and AI engineers emerge as the most appropriate implementers. It is crucial to decompose the problem of artificial intelligence risk in several dimensions: data protection, fairness, accuracy, robustness, and information security. Consequently, the main task is developing adequate metrics and risk models that manage to reduce uncertainty for decision-making in order to take informed decisions concerning the risk management of AI systems. The purpose of this paper is to orientate AI stakeholders about the depths of AI risk management. Although it is not extremely technical, it requires a basic knowledge of risk management, quantifying uncertainty, the FAIR model, machine learning, large language models and AI context engineering. The examples presented pretend to be very basic and understandable, providing simple ideas that can be developed regarding specific AI customized environments. There are many issues to solve in AI risk management, and this paper will present a holistic overview of the inter-dependencies of AI risks, and how to model them together, within risk scenarios.",

        "summary": "Achieving high performance, energy efficiency, and cost-effectiveness while maintaining architectural flexibility is a critical challenge in the development and deployment of edge AI devices. Monolithic SoC designs struggle with this complex balance mainly due to low manufacturing yields (below 16%) at advanced 360 mm^2 process nodes. This paper presents a novel chiplet-based RISC-V SoC architecture that addresses these limitations through modular AI acceleration and intelligent system level optimization. Our proposed design integrates 4 different key innovations in a 30mm x 30mm silicon interposer: adaptive cross-chiplet Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS); AI-aware Universal Chiplet Interconnect Express (UCIe) protocol extensions featuring streaming flow control units and compression-aware transfers; distributed cryptographic security across heterogeneous chiplets; and intelligent sensor-driven load migration. The proposed architecture integrates a 7nm RISC-V CPU chiplet with dual 5nm AI accelerators (15 TOPS INT8 each), 16GB HBM3 memory stacks, and dedicated power management controllers. Experimental results across industry standard benchmarks like MobileNetV2, ResNet-50 and real-time video processing demonstrate significant performance improvements. The AI-optimized configuration achieves ~14.7% latency reduction, 17.3% throughput improvement, and 16.2% power reduction compared to previous basic chiplet implementations. These improvements collectively translate to a 40.1% efficiency gain corresponding to ~3.5 mJ per MobileNetV2 inference (860 mW/244 images/s), while maintaining sub-5ms real-time capability across all experimented workloads. These performance upgrades demonstrate that modular chiplet designs can achieve near-monolithic computational density while enabling cost efficiency, scalability and upgradeability, crucial for next-generation edge AI device applications.",
