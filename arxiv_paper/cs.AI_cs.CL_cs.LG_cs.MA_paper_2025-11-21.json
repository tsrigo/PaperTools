        "summary": "Multi-robot systems have emerged as a key technology for addressing the efficiency and cost challenges in labor-intensive industries. In the representative scenario of smart farming, planning efficient harvesting schedules for a fleet of electric robots presents a highly challenging frontier problem. The complexity arises not only from the need to find Pareto-optimal solutions for the conflicting objectives of makespan and transportation cost, but also from the necessity to simultaneously manage payload constraints and finite battery capacity. When robot loads are dynamically updated during planned multi-trip operations, a mandatory recharge triggered by energy constraints introduces an unscheduled load reset. This interaction creates a complex cascading effect that disrupts the entire schedule and renders traditional optimization methods ineffective. To address this challenge, this paper proposes the segment anchoring-based balancing algorithm (SABA). The core of SABA lies in the organic combination of two synergistic mechanisms: the sequential anchoring and balancing mechanism, which leverages charging decisions as `anchors' to systematically reconstruct disrupted routes, while the proportional splitting-based rebalancing mechanism is responsible for the fine-grained balancing and tuning of the final solutions' makespans. Extensive comparative experiments, conducted on a real-world case study and a suite of benchmark instances, demonstrate that SABA comprehensively outperforms 6 state-of-the-art algorithms in terms of both solution convergence and diversity. This research provides a novel theoretical perspective and an effective solution for the multi-robot task allocation problem under energy constraints.",

        "summary": "Maximizing performance on available GPU hardware is an ongoing challenge for modern AI inference systems. Traditional approaches include writing custom GPU kernels and using specialized model compilers to tune high-level code for specific GPU targets. Recent work shows that LLM-based multi-agent systems can effectively perform such tuning, often outperforming existing compilers and eliminating the need for manual kernel development. However, the dynamics of multi-agent systems for this task remain unexplored. In this work, we present a logical framework for comparing multi-agent PyTorch optimization systems. Our evaluation shows that exploit-heavy strategies perform best when paired with error-fixing agents, and that performance correlates with the granularity of optimization steps. The best implementation achieves an average 2.88x speedup on an H100 GPU across diverse tasks in KernelBench, a benchmark suite covering a range of machine learning architectures in PyTorch.",

        "summary": "Modeling realistic and interactive multi-agent behavior is critical to autonomous driving and traffic simulation. However, existing diffusion and autoregressive approaches are limited by iterative sampling, sequential decoding, or task-specific designs, which hinder efficiency and reuse. We propose Masked Denoising Generation (MDG), a unified generative framework that reformulates multi-agent behavior modeling as the reconstruction of independently noised spatiotemporal tensors. Instead of relying on diffusion time steps or discrete tokenization, MDG applies continuous, per-agent and per-timestep noise masks that enable localized denoising and controllable trajectory generation in a single or few forward passes. This mask-driven formulation generalizes across open-loop prediction, closed-loop simulation, motion planning, and conditional generation within one model. Trained on large-scale real-world driving datasets, MDG achieves competitive closed-loop performance on the Waymo Sim Agents and nuPlan Planning benchmarks, while providing efficient, consistent, and controllable open-loop multi-agent trajectory generation. These results position MDG as a simple yet versatile paradigm for multi-agent behavior modeling.",

We built CodeX-Verify, a multi-agent system that uses four specialized agents to detect different types of bugs. We prove mathematically that combining agents with different detection patterns finds more bugs than any single agent when the agents look for different problems, confirmed by measuring agent correlation of p = 0.05--0.25. We also show that multiple vulnerabilities in the same code create exponentially more risk than previously thought--SQL injection plus exposed credentials creates 15x more danger (risk 300 vs. 20) than traditional models predict. Testing on 99 code samples with verified labels shows our system catches 76.1% of bugs, matching the best existing method while running faster and without test execution. We tested 15 different agent combinations and found that using multiple agents improves accuracy by 39.7 percentage points (from 32.8% to 72.4%) compared to single agents, with gains of +14.9pp, +13.5pp, and +11.2pp for agents 2, 3, and 4.

        "summary": "Test-time scaling has been shown to substantially improve large language models' (LLMs) mathematical reasoning. However, for a large portion of mathematical corpora, especially theorem proving, RLVR's scalability is limited: intermediate reasoning is crucial, while final answers are difficult to directly and reliably verify. Meanwhile, token-level SFT often degenerates into rote memorization rather than inducing longer chains of thought. Inspired by BERT's self-supervised tasks, we propose MR-RLVR (Masked-and-Reordered RLVR), which constructs process-level self-supervised rewards via \"masked-then-fill\" and \"step reordering\" to extract learnable signals from intermediate reasoning. Our training pipeline comprises two stages: we first perform self-supervised training on sampled mathematical calculation and proof data; we then conduct RLVR fine-tuning on mathematical calculation datasets where only outcomes are verifiable. We implement MR-RLVR on Qwen2.5-3B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B, and evaluate on AIME24, AIME25, AMC23, and MATH500. Under a fixed sampling and decoding budget, MR-RLVR achieves average relative gains over the original RLVR of +9.86% Pass@1, +5.27% Pass@5, and +4.00% Pass@8. These results indicate that incorporating process-aware self-supervised signals can effectively enhance RLVR's scalability and performance in only outcome-verifiable settings.",

Large Language Model (LLM) based evaluators, though powerful, come with drawbacks like high costs, bias, inconsistency, and hallucinations. To address these issues, we introduce SMILE: Semantic Metric Integrating Lexical Exactness, a novel approach that combines sentence-level semantic understanding with keyword-level semantic understanding and easy keyword matching. This composite method balances lexical precision and semantic relevance, offering a comprehensive evaluation. Extensive benchmarks across text, image, and video QA tasks show SMILE is highly correlated with human judgments and computationally lightweight, bridging the gap between lexical and semantic evaluation.",

Its constrained output format allows for simplified, deterministic automatic verification. However, we find that the options may leak exploitable signals, which makes the accuracy metrics unreliable for indicating real capabilities and encourages explicit or implicit answer guessing behaviors during RFT. We propose ReVeL (Rewrite and Verify by LLM), a framework that rewrites multiple-choice questions into open-form questions while keeping answers verifiable whenever possible. The framework categorizes questions according to different answer types, apply different rewriting and verification schemes, respectively. When applied for RFT, we converted 20k MCQA examples and use GRPO to finetune Qwen2.5-VL models. Models trained on ReVeL-OpenQA match MCQA accuracy on multiple-choice benchmarks and improve OpenQA accuracy by about six percentage points, indicating better data efficiency and more robust reward signals than MCQA-based training. When used for evaluation, ReVeL also reveals up to 20 percentage points of score inflation in MCQA benchmarks (relative to OpenQA), improves judging accuracy, and reduces both cost and latency.

Even when variables such as word duration, gender, speaker identity, tonal context, vowel height, and utterance position are controlled for, the effect of word remains a strong predictor of tonal realization. We present evidence that this effect of word is a semantic effect: word sense is shown to be a better predictor than word, and heterographic homophones are shown to have different pitch contours. The strongest evidence for the importance of semantics is that the pitch contours of individual word tokens can be predicted from their contextualized embeddings with an accuracy that substantially exceeds a permutation baseline. For phonetics, distributional semantics is a new kid on the block.

We present the Humanlike Multi-user Agent (HUMA), an LLM-based facilitator that participates in multi-party conversations using human-like strategies and timing. HUMA extends prior multi-user chatbot work with an event-driven architecture that handles messages, replies, reactions and introduces realistic response-time simulation. HUMA comprises three components-Router, Action Agent, and Reflection-which together adapt LLMs to group conversation dynamics. We evaluate HUMA in a controlled study with 97 participants in four-person role-play chats, comparing AI and human community managers (CMs). Participants classified CMs as human at near-chance rates in both conditions, indicating they could not reliably distinguish HUMA agents from humans. Subjective experience was comparable across conditions: community-manager effectiveness, social presence, and engagement/satisfaction differed only modestly with small effect sizes. Our results suggest that, in natural group chat settings, an AI facilitator can match human quality while remaining difficult to identify as nonhuman.",

However, there is no work that has investigated to leverage LLMs for sentiment analysis on social media posts in South African languages and detect social challenges. Consequently, in this work, we analyse the zero-shot performance of the state-of-the-art LLMs GPT-3.5, GPT-4, LlaMa 2, PaLM 2, and Dolly 2 to investigate the sentiment polarities of the 10 most emerging topics in English, Sepedi and Setswana social media posts that fall within the jurisdictional areas of 10 South African government departments. Our results demonstrate that there are big differences between the various LLMs, topics, and languages. In addition, we show that a fusion of the outcomes of different LLMs provides large gains in sentiment classification performance with sentiment classification errors below 1%. Consequently, it is now feasible to provide systems that generate reliable information about sentiment analysis to detect social challenges and draw conclusions about possible needs for actions on specific topics and within different language groups.",

Additionally, our experiments indicate that prompt engineering offers limited improvement in translation quality or model accuracy, and highlight the importance of involving language specialists in dataset translation and adaptation to ensure reliable and interpretable evaluations of language competency and reasoning in large language models.",

        "summary": "Understanding and predicting user behavior on social media platforms is crucial for content recommendation and platform design. While existing approaches focus primarily on common actions like retweeting and liking, the prediction of rare but significant behaviors remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a hybrid methodology for social media user behavior prediction that addresses both frequent and infrequent actions across a diverse action vocabulary. We evaluate our approach on a large-scale Bluesky dataset containing 6.4 million conversation threads spanning 12 distinct user actions across 25 persona clusters. Our methodology combines four complementary approaches: (i) a lookup database system based on historical response patterns; (ii) persona-specific LightGBM models with engineered temporal and semantic features for common actions; (iii) a specialized hybrid neural architecture fusing textual and temporal representations for rare action classification; and (iv) generation of text replies. Our persona-specific models achieve an average macro F1-score of 0.64 for common action prediction, while our rare action classifier achieves 0.56 macro F1-score across 10 rare actions. These results demonstrate that effective social media behavior prediction requires tailored modeling strategies recognizing fundamental differences between action types. Our approach achieved first place in the SocialSim: Social-Media Based Personas challenge organized at the Social Simulation with LLMs workshop at COLM 2025.",

Existing datasets for tabular QA, such as WikiTableQuestions and FinQA, are overwhelmingly monolingual (English) and present tables in a digitally perfect, clean format. This creates a significant gap between research and practice. To address this, we present \\textbf{MirageTVQA}, a new benchmark designed to evaluate VLMs on these exact dimensions. Featuring nearly 60,000 QA pairs across 24 languages, MirageTVQA challenges models with tables that are not only multilingual but also visually imperfect, incorporating realistic noise to mimic scanned documents. Our evaluation of the leading VLMs reveals two primary failure points: a severe degradation in performance (over 35\\% drop for the best models) when faced with visual noise and a consistent English-first bias where reasoning abilities fail to transfer to other languages. MirageTVQA provides a benchmark for measuring and driving progress towards more robust VLM models for table reasoning.

PARROT (i) isolates causal effects by comparing the neutral version of the same question with an authoritatively false version using a double-blind evaluation, (ii) quantifies confidence shifts toward the correct and imposed false responses using log-likelihood-based calibration tracking, and (iii) systematically classifies failure modes (e.g., robust correct, sycophantic agreement, reinforced error, stubborn error, self-correction, etc.) using an eight-state behavioral taxonomy. We evaluated 22 models using 1,302 MMLU-style multiple-choice questions across 13 domains and domain-specific authority templates. Findings show marked heterogeneity: advanced models (e.g., GPT-5, GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4.5) exhibit low \"follow rates\" ($\\leq 11\\%$, GPT-5: 4\\%) and minimal accuracy loss, while older/smaller models show severe epistemic collapse (GPT-4: 80\\%, Qwen 2.5-1.5B: 94\\%). The danger is not limited to response changes; weak models reduce confidence in the correct response while increasing confidence in the imposed incorrect response. While international law and global knowledge at the domain level exhibit high fragility, elementary mathematics is relatively resilient. Consequently, we argue that the goal of \"resistance to overfitting pressure\" should be addressed as a primary objective alongside accuracy, harm avoidance, and privacy for safe deployment in the real world.",

        "summary": "LLM-based conversational agents still struggle to maintain coherent, personalized interaction over many sessions: fixed context windows limit how much history can be kept in view, and most external memory approaches trade off between coarse retrieval over large chunks and fine-grained but fragmented views of the dialogue. Motivated by neo-Davidsonian event semantics, we propose an event-centric alternative that represents conversational history as short, event-like propositions which bundle together participants, temporal cues, and minimal local context, rather than as independent relation triples or opaque summaries. In contrast to work that aggressively compresses or forgets past content, our design aims to preserve information in a non-compressive form and make it more accessible, rather than more lossy. Concretely, we instruct an LLM to decompose each session into enriched elementary discourse units (EDUs) -- self-contained statements with normalized entities and source turn attributions -- and organize sessions, EDUs, and their arguments in a heterogeneous graph that supports associative recall. On top of this representation we build two simple retrieval-based variants that use dense similarity search and LLM filtering, with an optional graph-based propagation step to connect and aggregate evidence across related EDUs. Experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval$_S$ benchmarks show that these event-centric memories match or surpass strong baselines, while operating with much shorter QA contexts. Our results suggest that structurally simple, event-level memory provides a principled and practical foundation for long-horizon conversational agents.

        "summary": "News text classification is a crucial task in natural language processing, essential for organizing and filtering the massive volume of digital content. Traditional methods typically rely on statistical features like term frequencies or TF-IDF values, which are effective at capturing word-level importance but often fail to reflect contextual meaning. In contrast, modern deep learning approaches utilize semantic features to understand word usage within context, yet they may overlook simple, high-impact statistical indicators. This paper introduces an Attention-Guided Feature Fusion (AGFF) model that combines statistical and semantic features in a unified framework. The model applies an attention-based mechanism to dynamically determine the relative importance of each feature type, enabling more informed classification decisions. Through evaluation on benchmark news datasets, the AGFF model demonstrates superior performance compared to both traditional statistical models and purely semantic deep learning models. The results confirm that strategic integration of diverse feature types can significantly enhance classification accuracy. Additionally, ablation studies validate the contribution of each component in the fusion process. The findings highlight the model's ability to balance and exploit the complementary strengths of statistical and semantic representations, making it a practical and effective solution for real-world news classification tasks.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce fluent but factually incorrect responses, a phenomenon known as hallucination. Abstention, where the model chooses not to answer and instead outputs phrases such as \"I don't know\", is a common safeguard. However, existing abstention methods typically rely on post-generation signals, such as generation variations or feedback, which limits their ability to prevent unreliable responses in advance. In this paper, we introduce Aspect-Based Causal Abstention (ABCA), a new framework that enables early abstention by analysing the internal diversity of LLM knowledge through causal inference. This diversity reflects the multifaceted nature of parametric knowledge acquired from various sources, representing diverse aspects such as disciplines, legal contexts, or temporal frames. ABCA estimates causal effects conditioned on these aspects to assess the reliability of knowledge relevant to a given query. Based on these estimates, we enable two types of abstention: Type-1, where aspect effects are inconsistent (knowledge conflict), and Type-2, where aspect effects consistently support abstention (knowledge insufficiency). Experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that ABCA improves abstention reliability, achieves state-of-the-art performance, and enhances the interpretability of abstention decisions.",

To address this gap, we present and release LangMark, a new human-annotated multilingual APE dataset for English translation to seven languages: Brazilian Portuguese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, and Spanish. The dataset has 206,983 triplets, with each triplet consisting of a source segment, its NMT output, and a human post-edited translation. Annotated by expert human linguists, our dataset offers both linguistic diversity and scale. Leveraging this dataset, we empirically show that Large Language Models (LLMs) with few-shot prompting can effectively perform APE, improving upon leading commercial and even proprietary machine translation systems.

        "summary": "Text representation plays a critical role in tasks like clustering, retrieval, and other downstream applications. With the emergence of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in harnessing their capabilities for this purpose. However, most of the LLMs are inherently causal and optimized for next-token prediction, making them suboptimal for producing holistic representations. To address this, recent studies introduced pretext tasks to adapt LLMs for text representation. Most of these tasks, however, rely on token-level prediction objectives, such as the masked next-token prediction (MNTP) used in LLM2Vec. In this work, we explore the untapped potential of context compression as a pretext task for unsupervised adaptation of LLMs. During compression pre-training, the model learns to generate compact memory tokens, which substitute the whole context for downstream sequence prediction. Experiments demonstrate that a well-designed compression objective can significantly enhance LLM-based text representations, outperforming models trained with token-level pretext tasks. Further improvements through contrastive learning produce a strong representation model (LLM2Comp) that outperforms contemporary LLM-based text encoders on a wide range of tasks while being more sample-efficient, requiring significantly less training data.",

This work takes a principled approach to address this challenge. We analyze the needs and potential benefits of interpretable automated scoring for various assessment stakeholders and develop four principles of interpretability -- Faithfulness, Groundedness, Traceability, and Interchangeability (FGTI) -- targeted at those needs. To illustrate the feasibility of implementing these principles, we develop the AnalyticScore framework for short answer scoring as a baseline reference framework for future research. AnalyticScore operates by (1) extracting explicitly identifiable elements of the responses, (2) featurizing each response into human-interpretable values using LLMs, and (3) applying an intuitive ordinal logistic regression model for scoring. In terms of scoring accuracy, AnalyticScore outperforms many uninterpretable scoring methods, and is within only 0.06 QWK of the uninterpretable SOTA on average across 10 items from the ASAP-SAS dataset. By comparing against human annotators conducting the same featurization task, we further demonstrate that the featurization behavior of AnalyticScore aligns well with that of humans.",

Yet, whether these models truly grasp visual persuasion-how visual cues shape human attitudes and decisions-remains unclear. To probe this question, we construct a high-consensus dataset for binary persuasiveness judgment and introduce the taxonomy of Visual Persuasive Factors (VPFs), encompassing low-level perceptual, mid-level compositional, and high-level semantic cues. We also explore cognitive steering and knowledge injection strategies for persuasion-relevant reasoning. Empirical analysis across VLMs reveals a recall-oriented bias-models over-predict high persuasiveness-and weak discriminative power for low/mid-level features. In contrast, high-level semantic alignment between message and object presence emerges as the strongest predictor of human judgment. Among intervention strategies, simple instruction or unguided reasoning scaffolds yield marginal or negative effects, whereas concise, object-grounded rationales significantly improve precision and F1 scores. These results indicate that VLMs core limitation lies not in recognizing persuasive objects but in linking them to communicative intent.",

        "summary": "Large language models and knowledge graphs offer strong potential for advancing research on historical culture by supporting the extraction, analysis, and interpretation of cultural heritage. Using Hunan's modern historical celebrities shaped by Huxiang culture as a case study, pre-trained large models can help researchers efficiently extract key information, including biographical attributes, life events, and social relationships, from textual sources and construct structured knowledge graphs. However, systematic data resources for Hunan's historical celebrities remain limited, and general-purpose models often underperform in domain knowledge extraction and structured output generation in such low-resource settings. To address these issues, this study proposes a supervised fine-tuning approach for enhancing domain-specific information extraction. First, we design a fine-grained, schema-guided instruction template tailored to the Hunan historical celebrities domain and build an instruction-tuning dataset to mitigate the lack of domain-specific training corpora. Second, we apply parameter-efficient instruction fine-tuning to four publicly available large language models - Qwen2.5-7B, Qwen3-8B, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, and Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct - and develop evaluation criteria for assessing their extraction performance. Experimental results show that all models exhibit substantial performance gains after fine-tuning. Among them, Qwen3-8B achieves the strongest results, reaching a score of 89.3866 with 100 samples and 50 training iterations. This study provides new insights into fine-tuning vertical large language models for regional historical and cultural domains and highlights their potential for cost-effective applications in cultural heritage knowledge extraction and knowledge graph construction.",

        "summary": "Online conversations have become more prevalent on public discussion platforms (e.g. Reddit). With growing controversial topics, it is desirable to summarize not only diverse arguments, but also their rationale and justification. Early studies on text summarization focus on capturing general salient information in source documents, overlooking the argumentative nature of online conversations. Recent research on conversation summarization although considers the argumentative relationship among sentences, fail to explicate deeper argument structure within sentences for summarization. In this paper, we propose a novel task of argument-aware quantitative summarization to reveal the claim-reason structure of arguments in conversations, with quantities measuring argument strength. We further propose ARQUSUMM, a novel framework to address the task. To reveal the underlying argument structure within sentences, ARQUSUMM leverages LLM few-shot learning grounded in the argumentation theory to identify propositions within sentences and their claim-reason relationships. For quantitative summarization, ARQUSUMM employs argument structure-aware clustering algorithms to aggregate arguments and quantify their support. Experiments show that ARQUSUMM outperforms existing conversation and quantitative summarization models and generate summaries representing argument structures that are more helpful to users, of high textual quality and quantification accuracy.",

To address this, we frame the latent reasoning of TRMs as a form of classifier-free guidance and implicit policy improvement algorithm. Building on these insights, we propose a novel training scheme that provides a target for each loop during training. We demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances training efficiency. Our method reduces the total number of forward passes by 18x and eliminates halting mechanisms, while maintaining quality comparable to standard TRMs. Notably, we achieve 24% accuracy on ARC-1 with only 0.8M parameters, outperforming most LLMs.",

The recent work Soft Thinking has shown that LLMs' latent reasoning via soft concepts is a promising direction, but LLMs are trained on discrete tokens. To reduce this gap between the soft concepts in reasoning and the discrete tokens in training, we propose Soft Concept Mixing (SCM), a soft concept aware training scheme that directly exposes the model to soft representations during training. Specifically, SCM constructs a soft concept vector by forming a probability-weighted average of embeddings. Then, this vector is mixed into the model's hidden states, which embody rich contextual information. Finally, the entire latent reasoning process is optimized with Reinforcement Learning (RL). Experiments on five reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that SCM improves the reasoning performance of LLMs, and simultaneously maintains a stable training dynamic.",

In this paper, we introduce a novel reference-free metric for evaluating the conciseness of responses generated by LLMs. Our method quantifies non-essential content without relying on gold standard references and calculates the average of three calculations: i) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM abstractive summary; ii) a compression ratio between the original response and an LLM extractive summary; and iii) wordremoval compression, where an LLM removes as many non-essential words as possible from the response while preserving its meaning, with the number of tokens removed indicating the conciseness score. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed metric identifies redundancy in LLM outputs, offering a practical tool for automated evaluation of response brevity in conversational AI systems without the need for ground truth human annotations.",

To address this, we introduce PEPPER (PErcePtion Guided PERturbation), a backdoor defense that rewrites the caption into a semantically distant yet visually similar caption while adding unobstructive elements. With this rewriting strategy, PEPPER disrupt the trigger embedded in the input prompt, dilute the influence of trigger tokens and thereby achieve enhanced robustness. Experiments show that PEPPER is particularly effective against text encoder based attacks, substantially reducing attack success while preserving generation quality.

Here we revisit this question using interpretable dimensions, computed from seed words on opposite poles of the agentive and telic scales. Our findings support the link between unergativity/unaccusativity and agentivity/telicity, and demonstrate that using interpretable dimensions in conjunction with human judgments can offer valuable evidence for semantic properties that are not easily evaluated in rating tasks.",

Detection: All models show AUROC 0.996-1.00 at optimal layers. Uncensored Dolphin matches safety-trained models, demonstrating empathy encoding emerges independent of safety training. Phi-3 probes correlate strongly with EIA behavioral scores (r=0.71, p<0.01). Cross-model probe agreement is limited (Qwen: r=-0.06, Dolphin: r=0.18), revealing architecture-specific implementations despite convergent detection. Steering: Qwen achieves 65.3% success with bidirectional control and coherence at extreme interventions. Phi-3 shows 61.7% success with similar coherence. Dolphin exhibits asymmetric steerability: 94.4% success for pro-empathy steering but catastrophic breakdown for anti-empathy (empty outputs, code artifacts). Implications: The detection-steering gap varies by model. Qwen and Phi-3 maintain bidirectional coherence; Dolphin shows robustness only for empathy enhancement.

In this work, we focus on the problem of hierarchical concept retrieval from SNOMED CT with OOV queries, and propose an approach based on language model-based ontology embeddings. For evaluation, we construct OOV queries annotated against SNOMED CT concepts, testing the retrieval of the most direct subsumers and their less relevant ancestors.

We conduct a comprehensive probing study on six multilingual LLMs, covering all 268 transformer layers, using linear and nonlinear probes together with a new Token--Language Alignment analysis to quantify the layer-wise dynamics and geometric structure of language encoding. Our results show that language information becomes sharply separated in the first transformer block (+76.4$\\pm$8.2 percentage points from Layer 0 to 1) and remains almost fully linearly separable throughout model depth. We further find that the alignment between language directions and vocabulary embeddings is strongly tied to the language composition of the training data. Notably, Chinese-inclusive models achieve a ZH Match@Peak of 16.43\\%, whereas English-centric models achieve only 3.90\\%, revealing a 4.21$\\times$ structural imprinting effect.

Our experiments confirm that test-time training significantly reduces perplexity and bits-per-byte metrics across diverse domains from The Pile, with the largest improvements in structured or specialized datasets such as GitHub and EuroParl. We further validate that models not pretrained on The Pile benefit more from this adaptation than models already trained on similar data, allowing smaller models to approach the performance of larger ones.

        "summary": "Many AI detection models have been developed to counter the presence of articles created by artificial intelligence (AI). However, if a human-authored article is slightly polished by AI, a shift will occur in the borderline decision of these AI detection models, leading them to consider it AI-generated article. This misclassification may result in falsely accusing authors of AI plagiarism and harm the credibility of AI detector models. In English, some efforts were made to meet this challenge, but not in Arabic. In this paper, we generated two datasets. The first dataset contains 800 Arabic articles, half AI-generated and half human-authored. We used it to evaluate 14 Large Language models (LLMs) and commercial AI detectors to assess their ability in distinguishing between human-authored and AI-generated articles. The best 8 models were chosen to act as detectors for our primary concern, which is whether they would consider slightly polished human text as AI-generated. The second dataset, Ar-APT, contains 400 Arabic human-authored articles polished by 10 LLMs using 4 polishing settings, totaling 16400 samples. We use it to evaluate the 8 nominated models and determine whether slight polishing will affect their performance. The results reveal that all AI detectors incorrectly attribute a significant number of articles to AI. The best performing LLM, Claude-4 Sonnet, achieved 83.51%, their performance decreased to 57.63% for articles slightly polished by LLaMA-3. Whereas for the best performing commercial model, originality.AI, that achieves 92% accuracy, dropped to 12% for articles slightly polished by Mistral or Gemma-3.",

        "summary": "The rise of social networks has not only facilitated communication but also allowed the spread of harmful content. Although significant advances have been made in detecting toxic language in textual data, the exploration of concept-based explanations in toxicity detection remains limited. In this study, we leverage various subtype attributes present in toxicity detection datasets, such as obscene, threat, insult, identity attack, and sexual explicit as concepts that serve as strong indicators to identify whether language is toxic. However, disproportionate attribution of concepts towards the target class often results in classification errors. Our work introduces an interpretability technique based on the Concept Gradient (CG) method which provides a more causal interpretation by measuring how changes in concepts directly affect the output of the model. This is an extension of traditional gradient-based methods in machine learning, which often focus solely on input features. We propose the curation of Targeted Lexicon Set, which captures toxic words that contribute to misclassifications in text classification models. To assess the significance of these lexicon sets in misclassification, we compute Word-Concept Alignment (WCA) scores, which quantify the extent to which these words lead to errors due to over-attribution to toxic concepts. Finally, we introduce a lexicon-free augmentation strategy by generating toxic samples that exclude predefined toxic lexicon sets. This approach allows us to examine whether over-attribution persists when explicit lexical overlap is removed, providing insights into the model's attribution on broader toxic language patterns.",

While model fine-tuning is often employed to ensure safe responses, this technique is static and does not lend itself to everyday situations involving dynamic values and preferences. In this paper, we present a practical, reproducible, and model-agnostic procedure to evaluate whether a prompt candidate can effectively steer generated text toward specific human values, formalising a scoring method to quantify the presence and gain of target values in generated responses. We apply our method to a variant of the Wizard-Vicuna language model, using Schwartz's theory of basic human values and a structured evaluation through a dialogue dataset. With this setup, we compare a baseline prompt to one explicitly conditioned on values, and show that value steering is possible even without altering the model or dynamically optimising prompts.",

While adaptive decision boundary methods have shown great potential by eliminating manual threshold tuning, existing approaches assume isotropic distributions of known classes, restricting boundaries to balls and overlooking distributional variance along different directions. To address this limitation, we propose EliDecide, a novel method that learns ellipsoid decision boundaries with varying scales along different feature directions. First, we employ supervised contrastive learning to obtain a discriminative feature space for known samples. Second, we apply learnable matrices to parameterize ellipsoids as the boundaries of each known class, offering greater flexibility than spherical boundaries defined solely by centers and radii. Third, we optimize the boundaries via a novelly designed dual loss function that balances empirical and open-space risks: expanding boundaries to cover known samples while contracting them against synthesized pseudo-open samples. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple text intent benchmarks and further on a question classification dataset. The flexibility of the ellipsoids demonstrates superior open intent detection capability and strong potential for generalization to more text classification tasks in diverse complex open-world scenarios.",

The better these models understand human languages, the more natural and user-friendly the interaction with AI becomes, from everyday devices like computers and smartwatches to any tool that can act intelligently. Yet, the ability of industrial-scale LLMs to comprehend low-resource languages, such as Tunisian Arabic (Tunizi), is often overlooked. This neglect risks excluding millions of Tunisians from fully interacting with AI in their own language, pushing them toward French or English. Such a shift not only threatens the preservation of the Tunisian dialect but may also create challenges for literacy and influence younger generations to favor foreign languages. In this study, we introduce a novel dataset containing parallel Tunizi, standard Tunisian Arabic, and English translations, along with sentiment labels. We benchmark several popular LLMs on three tasks: transliteration, translation, and sentiment analysis. Our results reveal significant differences between models, highlighting both their strengths and limitations in understanding and processing Tunisian dialects. By quantifying these gaps, this work underscores the importance of including low-resource languages in the next generation of AI systems, ensuring technology remains accessible, inclusive, and culturally grounded.",

        "summary": "Running large language models (LLMs) locally is becoming increasingly common. While the growing availability of small open-source models and inference engines has lowered the entry barrier, users now face an overwhelming number of configuration choices. Identifying an optimal configuration -- balancing functional and non-functional requirements -- requires substantial manual effort. While several benchmarks target LLM inference, they are designed for narrow evaluation goals and not user-focused. They fail to integrate relevant system and task-specific metrics into a unified, easy-to-use benchmark that supports multiple inference engines, usage scenarios, and quantization levels. To address this gap, we present Bench360 -- Benchmarking Local LLM Inference from 360°. Bench360 allows users to easily define their own custom tasks along with datasets and relevant task-specific metrics and then automatically benchmarks selected LLMs, inference engines, and quantization levels across different usage scenarios (single stream, batch & server). Bench360 tracks a wide range of metrics, including (1) system metrics -- such as Computing Performance (e.g., latency, throughput), Resource Usage (e.g., energy per query), and Deployment (e.g., cold start time) -- and (2) task-specific metrics such as ROUGE, F1 score or accuracy. We demonstrate Bench360 on four common LLM tasks -- General Knowledge & Reasoning, QA, Summarization and Text-to-SQL -- across three hardware platforms and four state of the art inference engines. Our results reveal several interesting trade-offs between task performance and system-level efficiency, highlighting the differences in inference engines and models. Most importantly, there is no single best setup for local inference, which strongly motivates the need for a framework such as Bench360.",

        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems have become a dominant approach to augment large language models (LLMs) with external knowledge. However, existing vector database (VecDB) retrieval pipelines rely on flat or single-resolution indexing structures, which cannot adapt to the varying semantic granularity required by diverse user queries. This limitation leads to suboptimal trade-offs between retrieval speed and contextual relevance. To address this, we propose \\textbf{Semantic Pyramid Indexing (SPI)}, a novel multi-resolution vector indexing framework that introduces query-adaptive resolution control for RAG in VecDBs. Unlike existing hierarchical methods that require offline tuning or separate model training, SPI constructs a semantic pyramid over document embeddings and dynamically selects the optimal resolution level per query through a lightweight classifier. This adaptive approach enables progressive retrieval from coarse-to-fine representations, significantly accelerating search while maintaining semantic coverage. We implement SPI as a plugin for both FAISS and Qdrant backends and evaluate it across multiple RAG tasks including MS MARCO, Natural Questions, and multimodal retrieval benchmarks. SPI achieves up to \\textbf{5.7$\\times$} retrieval speedup and \\textbf{1.8$\\times$} memory efficiency gain while improving end-to-end QA F1 scores by up to \\textbf{2.5 points} compared to strong baselines. Our theoretical analysis provides guarantees on retrieval quality and latency bounds, while extensive ablation studies validate the contribution of each component. The framework's compatibility with existing VecDB infrastructures makes it readily deployable in production RAG systems.

However, these methods mostly employ single-shot plans that are typically limited to simple motions, or iterative refinement which requires multiple calls to the video generator, incuring high computational cost. To overcome these limitations, we propose SketchVerify, a training-free, sketch-verification-based planning framework that improves motion planning quality with more dynamically coherent trajectories (i.e., physically plausible and instruction-consistent motions) prior to full video generation by introducing a test-time sampling and verification loop. Given a prompt and a reference image, our method predicts multiple candidate motion plans and ranks them using a vision-language verifier that jointly evaluates semantic alignment with the instruction and physical plausibility. To efficiently score candidate motion plans, we render each trajectory as a lightweight video sketch by compositing objects over a static background, which bypasses the need for expensive, repeated diffusion-based synthesis while achieving comparable performance. We iteratively refine the motion plan until a satisfactory one is identified, which is then passed to the trajectory-conditioned generator for final synthesis. Experiments on WorldModelBench and PhyWorldBench demonstrate that our method significantly improves motion quality, physical realism, and long-term consistency compared to competitive baselines while being substantially more efficient. Our ablation study further shows that scaling up the number of trajectory candidates consistently enhances overall performance.",

This paper focuses on human-robot interaction (HRI) based on human-robot dialogue that relies on the robot action confirmation and action step generation using multimodal scene understanding. The state-of-the-art approach uses multimodal transformers to generate robot action steps aligned with robot action confirmation from a single clip showing a task composed of multiple micro steps. Although actions towards a long-horizon task depend on each other throughout an entire video, the current approaches mainly focus on clip-level processing and do not leverage long-context information. This paper proposes a long-context Q-former incorporating left and right context dependency in full videos. Furthermore, this paper proposes a text-conditioning approach to feed text embeddings directly into the LLM decoder to mitigate the high abstraction of the information in text by Q-former. Experiments with the YouCook2 corpus show that the accuracy of confirmation generation is a major factor in the performance of action planning. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the long-context Q-former improves the confirmation and action planning by integrating VideoLLaMA3.",

The MusicAIR framework facilitates music generation from lyrics, text, and images. The generated score adheres to established principles of music theory, lyrical structure, and rhythmic conventions. We developed Generate AI Music (GenAIM), a web tool using MusicAIR for lyric-to-song, text-to-music, and image-to-music generation. In our experiments, we evaluated AI-generated music scores produced by the system using both standard music metrics and innovative analysis that compares these compositions with original works. The system achieves an average key confidence of 85%, outperforming human composers at 79%, and aligns closely with established music theory standards, demonstrating its ability to generate diverse, human-like compositions. As a co-pilot tool, GenAIM can serve as a reliable music composition assistant and a possible educational composition tutor while simultaneously lowering the entry barrier for all aspiring musicians, which is innovative and significantly contributes to AI for music generation.",

Our comparative analysis of 20+ leading models, such as Qwen, GPT-4o, Claude, LLaMA, and DeepSeek, reveals universal challenges-fundamental instability in value systems, systematic under-representation of younger demographics, and non-linear relationships between model scale and alignment quality-alongside divergent regional development trajectories.

        "summary": "Machine unlearning, the removal of a training subset's influence from a deployed model, is critical for privacy preservation and model reliability, yet gradient ascent on forget samples often harms retained knowledge. Existing approaches face a persistent tradeoff between effective forgetting and preservation on the retain set. While previous methods provide useful heuristics, they often lack a formal analysis on how exactly forgetting updates harm retained knowledge, and whether the side effects can be removed with theoretical guarantees. To explore a theoretically sound and simple solution, we start from the first principle on how performance on the retain set is actually affected: a first-order analysis of the local change of the retain loss under small parameter updates during model training. We start from a crisp equivalence: the retain loss is unchanged to first order iff the update direction is orthogonal to the subspace spanned by retain gradients (\"retain-invariant\"). This identifies the entangled component as the tangential part of forget update within the retain-gradient subspace, and characterizes disentanglement as orthogonality. Guided by this, we propose the Geometric-disentanglement Unlearning (GU) that decomposes any candidate forget gradient update into tangential and normal components to retain space and executes only the normal component. Under a standard trust-region budget, the projected direction aligned with the raw forget gradient is optimal among all first-order retain-invariant moves, and we also derive the optimal projected direction for joint forget-retain updating objectives. Our method is plug-and-play and can be attached to existing gradient-based unlearning procedures to mitigate side effects. GU achieves consistent improvement on various methods across three benchmarks TOFU, MUSE, and WMDP.",

Research on total (admissible) orderings of such types of fuzzy subsets, and specifically those belonging to the set $\\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\\rightarrow Y_m}$ consisting of discrete fuzzy numbers $A$ whose support is a closed subinterval of the finite chain $L_n = \\{0, 1, \\ldots, n\\}$ and whose membership values $A(x)$, for $x \\in L_n$, belong to the set $Y_m = \\{ 0 = y_1 < y_2 < \\cdots < y_{m-1} < y_m = 1 \\}$, has facilitated the development of new methods for constructing logical connectives, based on a bijective function, called $\\textit{pos function}$, that determines the position of each $A \\in \\mathcal{D}_1^{L_n\\rightarrow Y_m}$. For this reason, in this work we revisit the problem by introducing algorithms that exploit the combinatorial structure of total (admissible) orders to compute the $\\textit{pos}$ function and its inverse with exactness. The proposed approach achieves a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(n^{2} m \\log n)$, which is quadratic in the size of the underlying chain ($n$) and linear in the number of membership levels ($m$). The key point is that the dominant factor is $m$, ensuring scalability with respect to the granularity of membership values. The results demonstrate that this formulation substantially reduces computational cost and enables the efficient implementation of algebraic operations -- such as aggregation and implication -- on the set of discrete fuzzy numbers.",

To address this gap, we introduce ConfusedTourist, a novel cultural adversarial robustness suite designed to assess VLMs' stability against perturbed geographical cues. Our experiments reveal a critical vulnerability, where accuracy drops heavily under simple image-stacking perturbations and even worsens with its image-generation-based variant. Interpretability analyses further show that these failures stem from systematic attention shifts toward distracting cues, diverting the model from its intended focus.

        "summary": "Benchmarks are pivotal in driving AI progress, and invalid benchmark questions frequently undermine their reliability. Manually identifying and correcting errors among thousands of benchmark questions is not only infeasible but also a critical bottleneck for reliable evaluation. In this work, we introduce a framework for systematic benchmark revision that leverages statistical analysis of response patterns to flag potentially invalid questions for further expert review. Our approach builds on a core assumption commonly used in AI evaluations that the mean score sufficiently summarizes model performance. This implies a unidimensional latent construct underlying the measurement experiment, yielding expected ranges for various statistics for each item. When empirically estimated values for these statistics fall outside the expected range for an item, the item is more likely to be problematic. Across nine widely used benchmarks, our method guides expert review to identify problematic questions with up to 84\\% precision. In addition, we introduce an LLM-judge first pass to review questions, further reducing human effort. Together, these components provide an efficient and scalable framework for systematic benchmark revision.",

Inspired by the simplicity of retro BASIC, we repurpose numbered lines and simple commands as an interpretable cognitive control layer. Modern LLMs can reliably simulate such short programs, enabling transparent multi-step reasoning inside the model. A natural-language interpreter file specifies command semantics, memory updates, and logging behavior. Our mental-model interpreter extracts declarative and procedural knowledge, detects contradictions, and produces resolutions when necessary. A comparison across three LLMs on a benchmark of knowledge extraction, conflict detection, and reasoning tasks shows that all models can execute Cognitive BASIC programs, with overall strong but not uniform performance.",

Drawing on theories from social cognition and the stereotype content model in Social Psychology, we analyze how English speakers talk about vaccines on social media to understand the evolving narrative around vaccines in social media posts. To do that, we first introduce a novel dataset comprising 18.7 million curated posts on vaccine discourse from 2013 to 2022. This extensive collection-filtered down from an initial 129 million posts through rigorous preprocessing-captures both pre-COVID and COVID-19 periods, offering valuable insights into the evolution of English-speaking X users' perceptions related to vaccines. Our analysis shows that the COVID-19 pandemic led to complex shifts in X users' sentiment and discourse around vaccines. We observe that negative emotion word usage decreased during the pandemic, with notable rises in usage of surprise, and trust related emotion words. Furthermore, vaccine-related language tended to use more warmth-focused words associated with trustworthiness, along with positive, competence-focused words during the early days of the pandemic, with a marked rise in negative word usage towards the end of the pandemic, possibly reflecting a growing vaccine hesitancy and skepticism.",

        "summary": "It is known that reinforcement learning (RL) is data-hungry. To improve sample-efficiency of RL, it has been proposed that the learning algorithm utilize data from 'approximately similar' processes. However, since the process models are unknown, identifying which other processes are similar poses a challenge. In this work, we study this problem in the context of the benchmark Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider a setting with multiple agents, each corresponding to a copy of a linear process to be controlled. The agents' local processes can be partitioned into clusters based on similarities in dynamics and tasks. Combining ideas from sequential elimination and zeroth-order policy optimization, we propose a new algorithm that performs simultaneous clustering and learning to output a personalized policy (controller) for each cluster. Under a suitable notion of cluster separation that captures differences in closed-loop performance across systems, we prove that our approach guarantees correct clustering with high probability. Furthermore, we show that the sub-optimality gap of the policy learned for each cluster scales inversely with the size of the cluster, with no additional bias, unlike in prior works on collaborative learning-based control. Our work is the first to reveal how clustering can be used in data-driven control to learn personalized policies that enjoy statistical gains from collaboration but do not suffer sub-optimality due to inclusion of data from dissimilar processes. From a distributed implementation perspective, our method is attractive as it incurs only a mild logarithmic communication overhead.",

In our approach, the agent embodies the user's \"persona\" (e.g. user profile or taste) and is powered by a large language model (LLM). To enable the agent to leverage rich contextual information, we introduce a Knowledge-Graph-enhanced Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) mechanism that constructs an LLM-derived graph index of relevant documents and summarizes communities of related information. Our framework generates personalized prompts by combining: (1) a summary of the user's historical behaviors and preferences extracted from the knowledge graph, and (2) relevant global interaction patterns identified through graph-based community detection. This dynamic prompt engineering approach allows the agent to maintain consistent persona-aligned behaviors while benefiting from collective knowledge.

        "summary": "Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-MS) is a cornerstone in biomolecular analysis, offering precise identification of pathogens through unique mass spectral signatures. Yet, its reliance on labor-intensive sample preparation and multi-shot spectral averaging restricts its use to laboratory settings, rendering it impractical for real-time environmental monitoring. These limitations are especially pronounced in emerging aerosol MALDI-MS systems, where autonomous sampling generates noisy spectra for unknown aerosol analytes, requiring single-shot detection for effective analysis. Addressing these challenges, we propose the Mass Spectral Dictionary-Guided Transformer (MS-DGFormer): a data-driven framework that redefines spectral analysis by directly processing raw, minimally prepared mass spectral data. MS-DGFormer leverages a transformer architecture, designed to capture the long-range dependencies inherent in these time-series spectra. To enhance feature extraction, we introduce a novel dictionary encoder that integrates denoised spectral information derived from Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), enabling the model to discern critical biomolecular patterns from single-shot spectra with robust performance. This innovation provides a system to achieve superior pathogen identification from aerosol samples, facilitating autonomous, real-time analysis in field conditions. By eliminating the need for extensive preprocessing, our method unlocks the potential for portable, deployable MALDI-MS platforms, revolutionizing environmental pathogen detection and rapid response to biological threats.",

        "summary": "Continual learning aims to enable neural networks to acquire new knowledge without forgetting previously learned information. While recent prompt-based methods perform strongly in class-incremental settings, they remain vulnerable under domain shifts, where the input distribution changes but the label space remains fixed. This exposes a persistent problem known as representation drift. Shared representations evolve in ways that overwrite previously useful features and cause forgetting even when prompts isolate task-specific parameters. To address this issue, we introduce InTAct, a method that preserves functional behavior in shared layers without freezing parameters or storing past data. InTAct captures the characteristic activation ranges associated with previously learned tasks and constrains updates to ensure the network remains consistent within these regions, while still allowing for flexible adaptation elsewhere. In doing so, InTAct stabilizes the functional role of important neurons rather than directly restricting parameter values. The approach is architecture-agnostic and integrates seamlessly into existing prompt-based continual learning frameworks. By regulating representation changes where past knowledge is encoded, InTAct achieves a principled balance between stability and plasticity. Across diverse domain-incremental benchmarks, including DomainNet and ImageNet-R, InTAct consistently reduces representation drift and improves performance, increasing Average Accuracy by up to 8 percentage points over state-of-the-art baselines.",

MVDPDPSR is an extension of the vehicle routing problem and a spatio-temporal system optimization problem, widely applied in scenarios such as on-demand delivery. Classical operations research methods face bottlenecks in computational complexity and time efficiency when handling large-scale dynamic problems. Although existing reinforcement learning methods have achieved some progress, they still encounter several challenges: 1) Independent decoding across multiple vehicles fails to model joint action distributions; 2) The feature extraction network struggles to capture inter-entity relationships; 3) The joint action space is exponentially large. To address these issues, we designed the MAPT framework, which employs a Transformer Encoder to extract entity representations, combines a Transformer Decoder with a Pointer Network to generate joint action sequences in an AutoRegressive manner, and introduces a Relation-Aware Attention module to capture inter-entity relationships. Additionally, we guide the model's decision-making using informative priors to facilitate effective exploration. Experiments on 8 datasets demonstrate that MAPT significantly outperforms existing baseline methods in terms of performance and exhibits substantial computational time advantages compared to classical operations research methods.",

While such objectives shape first- and second-order statistics of the representation, they largely ignore the local geometry of the underlying data manifold. In this paper, we introduce CurvSSL, a curvature-regularized self-supervised learning framework, and its RKHS extension, kernel CurvSSL. Our approach retains a standard two-view encoder-projector architecture with a Barlow Twins-style redundancy-reduction loss on projected features, but augments it with a curvature-based regularizer. Each embedding is treated as a vertex whose $k$ nearest neighbors define a discrete curvature score via cosine interactions on the unit hypersphere; in the kernel variant, curvature is computed from a normalized local Gram matrix in an RKHS. These scores are aligned and decorrelated across augmentations by a Barlow-style loss on a curvature-derived matrix, encouraging both view invariance and consistency of local manifold bending. Experiments on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets with a ResNet-18 backbone show that curvature-regularized SSL yields competitive or improved linear evaluation performance compared to Barlow Twins and VICReg. Our results indicate that explicitly shaping local geometry is a simple and effective complement to purely statistical SSL regularizers.",

Among the various strategies, subgraph-based methods provide an interpretable bridge between symbolic pattern discovery and continuous embedding learning.

We propose DS-Span, a single-phase discriminative subgraph mining framework that unifies pattern growth, pruning, and supervision-driven scoring within one traversal of the search space. DS-Span introduces a coverage-capped eligibility mechanism that dynamically limits exploration once a graph is sufficiently represented, and an information-gain-guided selection that promotes subgraphs with strong class-separating ability while minimizing redundancy. The resulting subgraph set serves as an efficient, interpretable basis for downstream graph embedding and classification. Extensive experiments across benchmarks demonstrate that DS-Span generates more compact and discriminative subgraph features than prior multi-stage methods, achieving higher or comparable accuracy with significantly reduced runtime.

        "summary": "Computing worst-case robust strategies in pursuit-evasion games (PEGs) is time-consuming, especially when real-world factors like partial observability are considered. While important for general security purposes, real-time applicable pursuit strategies for graph-based PEGs are currently missing when the pursuers only have imperfect information about the evader's position. Although state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) methods like Equilibrium Policy Generalization (EPG) and Grasper provide guidelines for learning graph neural network (GNN) policies robust to different game dynamics, they are restricted to the scenario of perfect information and do not take into account the possible case where the evader can predict the pursuers' actions. This paper introduces the first approach to worst-case robust real-time pursuit strategies (R2PS) under partial observability. We first prove that a traditional dynamic programming (DP) algorithm for solving Markov PEGs maintains optimality under the asynchronous moves by the evader. Then, we propose a belief preservation mechanism about the evader's possible positions, extending the DP pursuit strategies to a partially observable setting. Finally, we embed the belief preservation into the state-of-the-art EPG framework to finish our R2PS learning scheme, which leads to a real-time pursuer policy through cross-graph reinforcement learning against the asynchronous-move DP evasion strategies. After reinforcement learning, our policy achieves robust zero-shot generalization to unseen real-world graph structures and consistently outperforms the policy directly trained on the test graphs by the existing game RL approach.",

This paper introduces Repulsive Bayesian Prompt Learning (ReBaPL), a novel method for Bayesian prompt learning, designed to efficiently explore the complex and often multimodal posterior landscape of prompts. Our method integrates a cyclical step-size schedule with a stochastic gradient Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (SGHMC) algorithm, enabling alternating phases of exploration to discover new modes, and exploitation to refine existing modes. Furthermore, we introduce a repulsive force derived from a potential function over probability metrics (including Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Wasserstein distance) computed on the distributions of representations produced by different prompts. This representation-space repulsion diversifies exploration and prevents premature collapse to a single mode. Our approach allows for a more comprehensive characterization of the prompt posterior distribution, leading to improved generalization. In contrast to prior Bayesian prompt learning methods, our method provides a modular plug-and-play Bayesian extension of any existing prompt learning method based on maximum likelihood estimation. We demonstrate the efficacy of ReBaPL on several benchmark datasets, showing superior performance over state-of-the-art methods for prompt learning.",

        "summary": "Our work introduces SAVeD (Semantically Aware Version Detection), a contrastive learning-based framework for identifying versions of structured datasets without relying on metadata, labels, or integration-based assumptions. SAVeD addresses a common challenge in data science of repeated labor due to a difficulty of similar work or transformations on datasets. SAVeD employs a modified SimCLR pipeline, generating augmented table views through random transformations (e.g., row deletion, encoding perturbations). These views are embedded via a custom transformer encoder and contrasted in latent space to optimize semantic similarity. Our model learns to minimize distances between augmented views of the same dataset and maximize those between unrelated tables. We evaluate performance using validation accuracy and separation, defined respectively as the proportion of correctly classified version/non-version pairs on a hold-out set, and the difference between average similarities of versioned and non-versioned tables (defined by a benchmark, and not provided to the model). Our experiments span five canonical datasets from the Semantic Versioning in Databases Benchmark, and demonstrate substantial gains post-training. SAVeD achieves significantly higher accuracy on completely unseen tables in, and a significant boost in separation scores, confirming its capability to distinguish semantically altered versions. Compared to untrained baselines and prior state-of-the-art dataset-discovery methods like Starmie, our custom encoder achieves competitive or superior results.",

Current state-of-the-art 3D de-novo design flow matching or diffusion-based models are limited to generating a single conformation. However, the conformational landscape of a molecule determines its observable properties and how tightly it is able to bind to a given protein target. By generating a representative set of low-energy conformers, we can more directly assess these properties and potentially improve the ability to generate molecules with desired thermodynamic observables. Towards this aim, we propose FlexiFlow, a novel architecture that extends flow-matching models, allowing for the joint sampling of molecules along with multiple conformations while preserving both equivariance and permutation invariance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the QM9 and GEOM Drugs datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results in molecular generation tasks. Our results show that FlexiFlow can generate valid, unstrained, unique, and novel molecules with high fidelity to the training data distribution, while also capturing the conformational diversity of molecules. Moreover, we show that our model can generate conformational ensembles that provide similar coverage to state-of-the-art physics-based methods at a fraction of the inference time. Finally, FlexiFlow can be successfully transferred to the protein-conditioned ligand generation task, even when the dataset contains only static pockets without accompanying conformations.",

Long-term satellite-based LST records, such as those derived from the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR), are essential for detecting climate trends. However, the coarse spatial resolution of AVHRR's global area coverage (GAC) data limit their utility for analyzing fine-scale permafrost dynamics and other surface processes in the Arctic. This paper presents a new 42 years pan-Arctic LST dataset, downscaled from AVHRR GAC to 1 km with a super-resolution algorithm based on a deep anisotropic diffusion model. The model is trained on MODIS LST data, using coarsened inputs and native-resolution outputs, guided by high-resolution land cover, digital elevation, and vegetation height maps. The resulting dataset provides twice-daily, 1 km LST observations for the entire pan-Arctic region over four decades. This enhanced dataset enables improved modelling of permafrost, reconstruction of near-surface air temperature, and assessment of surface mass balance of the Greenland Ice Sheet. Additionally, it supports climate monitoring efforts in the pre-MODIS era and offers a framework adaptable to future satellite missions for thermal infrared observation and climate data record continuity.",

We introduce an evaluation suite of diverse and realistic staged misconduct scenarios to assess agents for this behavior. Across models and settings, we find that: (1) the frequency of whistleblowing varies widely across model families, (2) increasing the complexity of the task the agent is instructed to complete lowers whistleblowing tendencies, (3) nudging the agent in the system prompt to act morally substantially raises whistleblowing rates, and (4) giving the model more obvious avenues for non-whistleblowing behavior, by providing more tools and a detailed workflow to follow, decreases whistleblowing rates.

On CIFAR-100N, Step-E improves the test accuracy of a ResNet-18 model from 43.3% (+/- 0.7%) to 50.4% (+/- 0.9%), clearly outperforming loss truncation, self-paced learning, and one-shot filtering while approaching the clean-label oracle at 60.5% (+/- 0.2%).

While existing approaches to energy optimization focus on architectural improvements or hardware acceleration, there is a lack of principled methods to predict energy consumption across different model configurations and hardware setups. We propose an adaptation of Kaplan scaling laws to predict GPU energy consumption for diffusion models based on computational complexity (FLOPs). Our approach decomposes diffusion model inference into text encoding, iterative denoising, and decoding components, with the hypothesis that denoising operations dominate energy consumption due to their repeated execution across multiple inference steps. We conduct comprehensive experiments across four state-of-the-art diffusion models (Stable Diffusion 2, Stable Diffusion 3.5, Flux, and Qwen) on three GPU architectures (NVIDIA A100, A4000, A6000), spanning various inference configurations including resolution (256x256 to 1024x1024), precision (fp16/fp32), step counts (10-50), and classifier-free guidance settings. Our energy scaling law achieves high predictive accuracy within individual architectures (R-squared > 0.9) and exhibits strong cross-architecture generalization, maintaining high rank correlations across models and enabling reliable energy estimation for unseen model-hardware combinations. These results validate the compute-bound nature of diffusion inference and provide a foundation for sustainable AI deployment planning and carbon footprint estimation.",

        "summary": "Multivariate Time-Series (MTS) clustering discovers intrinsic grouping patterns of temporal data samples. Although time-series provide rich discriminative information, they also contain substantial redundancy, such as steady-state machine operation records and zero-output periods of solar power generation. Such redundancy diminishes the attention given to discriminative timestamps in representation learning, thus leading to performance bottlenecks in MTS clustering. Masking has been widely adopted to enhance the MTS representation, where temporal reconstruction tasks are designed to capture critical information from MTS. However, most existing masking strategies appear to be standalone preprocessing steps, isolated from the learning process, which hinders dynamic adaptation to the importance of clustering-critical timestamps. Accordingly, this paper proposes the Evolving-masked MTS Clustering (EMTC) method, with its model architecture composed of Importance-aware Variate-wise Masking (IVM) and Multi-Endogenous Views (MEV) representation learning modules. IVM adaptively guides the model in learning more discriminative representations for clustering, while the MEV-based reconstruction and contrastive learning pathways enhance the generalization. That is, the MEV reconstruction facilitates multi-perspective complementary to prevent the masking from premature convergence, and the clustering-guided contrastive learning facilitates the joint optimization of representation and clustering. Extensive experiments on 15 real benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of EMTC in comparison with eight SOTA methods, where the EMTC achieves an average improvement of 4.85% over the strongest baselines.",

Training these models is computationally intensive, and centralizing the process raises significant data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling alternative, but existing Federated Multi-Objective Optimization (FMOO) methods face severe communication bottlenecks as their reliance on transmitting multiple gradients to a server is unscalable for large models. We introduce FIRM (Federated In-client Regularized Multi-objective alignment), a novel algorithm that achieves both client disagreement drift mitigation and communication efficiency. In FIRM, each client locally solves a regularized multi-objective optimization problem. By directly mitigating client disagreement drift through in-client regularization, our method eliminates the need for the multi-gradient transmissions common in prior works. Consequently, clients need only to transmit a single set of adapted parameters, maintaining high communication efficiency. We prove that our algorithm converges to Pareto-stationary points and, to our knowledge, provide the first finite-time convergence guarantees for this federated multi-objective alignment setting. Empirically, we show that FIRM leads to smoother training dynamics, reduced client disagreement drift, and improved reward trade-offs compared to baselines. We further propose a method to incorporate a preference over the objectives and report empirical Pareto plots, demonstrating that FIRM can smoothly adapt trade-offs between objectives in response to specified preferences.",

We prove a conservation law for linear DEQs which implies that the parameters remain trapped on spheres during training and use this property to show that gradient flow remains well-conditioned for all time.

To address these challenges, we introduce Tree of Claims (ToC), an innovative framework that redefines claim editing as a guided search problem. ToC synergistically integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a collaborative multi-agent system, comprising an LLM-based EditorAgent that proposes contextually grounded edits, and an ExaminerAgent that mimics patent examiner critiques through structured, chain-of-thought analyses of novelty and prior art disclosure. Driven by a carefully designed multi-objective reward function, ToC jointly optimizes novelty, scope retention, and semantic coherence. Experimental evaluation on a benchmark of 1145 claims demonstrates that ToC significantly outperforms standard LLMs in zero-shot and few-shot scenarios, achieving an average composite score improvement of 8\\%, and up to 9\\% in certain cases. Extensive experiments, including detailed ablation studies, validate ToC's efficacy in generating superior, legally robust claim revisions. Overall, ToC establishes a transparent, controllable, and interpretable methodology that effectively bridges advanced LLM reasoning capabilities with strategic MCTS planning for structured patent claim optimization.The source code is available at https://github.com/ysy2003/ToC.",

Wearable ECGs enable long-term monitoring but suffer from irregular, lower sampling frequencies due to battery constraints, making morphology analysis challenging. We present an end-to-end classification pipeline to address these issues. We train a latent ODE to model continuous ECG waveforms and create robust feature vectors from high-frequency single-channel signals. We construct three latent vectors per waveform via downsampling the initial 360 Hz ECG to 90 Hz and 45 Hz. We then use a gradient boosted tree to classify these vectors and test robustness across frequencies. Performance shows minimal degradation, with macro-averaged AUC-ROC values of 0.984, 0.978, and 0.976 at 360 Hz, 90 Hz, and 45 Hz, respectively, suggesting a way to sidestep the trade-off between signal fidelity and battery life.

        "summary": "Detecting trajectory anomalies is a vital task in modern Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling the identification of unsafe, inefficient, or irregular travel behaviours. While deep learning has emerged as the dominant approach, several key challenges remain unresolved. First, sub-trajectory anomaly detection, capable of pinpointing the precise segments where anomalies occur, remains underexplored compared to whole-trajectory analysis. Second, many existing methods depend on carefully tuned thresholds, limiting their adaptability in real-world applications. Moreover, the irregular sampling of trajectory data and the presence of noise in training sets further degrade model performance, making it difficult to learn reliable representations of normal routes. To address these challenges, we propose a contrastive reinforcement learning framework for online trajectory anomaly detection, CroTad. Our method is threshold-free and robust to noisy, irregularly sampled data. By incorporating contrastive learning, CroTad learns to extract diverse normal travel patterns for different itineraries and effectively distinguish anomalous behaviours at both sub-trajectory and point levels. The detection module leverages deep reinforcement learning to perform online, real-time anomaly scoring, enabling timely and fine-grained identification of abnormal segments. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our framework across various evaluation scenarios.",

Prior generative approaches such as PepINVENT require chemists to pre-specify mutable positions for optimization, choices that are not always known a priori, and rely on static pretraining and optimization algorithms that limit the model's ability to generalize and effectively optimize peptide sequences. We introduce PepEVOLVE, a position-aware, dynamic framework that learns both where to edit and how to dynamically optimize peptides for multi-objective improvement. PepEVOLVE (i) augments pretraining with dynamic masking and CHUCKLES shifting to improve generalization, (ii) uses a context-free multi-armed bandit router that discovers high-reward residues, and (iii) couples a novel evolving optimization algorithm with group-relative advantage to stabilize reinforcement updates. During in silico evaluations, the router policy reliably learns and concentrates probability on chemically meaningful sites that influence the peptide's properties. On a therapeutically motivated Rev-binding macrocycle benchmark, PepEVOLVE outperformed PepINVENT by reaching higher mean scores (approximately 0.8 vs. 0.6), achieving best candidates with a score of 0.95 (vs. 0.87), and converging in fewer steps under the task of optimizing permeability and lipophilicity with structural constraints.

        "summary": "The growing number of Large Language Models (LLMs) with diverse capabilities and response styles provides users with a wider range of choices, which presents challenges in selecting appropriate LLMs, as user preferences vary in terms of performance, cost, and response style. Current LLM selection methods typically optimize for a single fixed objective, such as performance, cost, or a trade-off between them, and fail to learn individual user preferences from interaction data. To address these limitations, we propose PersonalizedRouter, a graph-based framework that models diverse user profiles and performs personalized LLM selection by leveraging interaction data that includes task context, queries, candidate LLMs, and user decisions. To capture contextual information between user queries and optimal LLMs, PersonalizedRouter converts the interaction data into a heterogeneous graph, where the relationships between different types of nodes are represented by edges. To evaluate adaptability across users, we design two strategies: the multi-cost-efficiency simulation strategy and the LLM-as-a-Judge strategy. In addition, we construct PersonaRoute-Bench, a large-scale benchmark with 1,000 simulated users and 10 LLMs. Experimental results show that PersonalizedRouter significantly outperforms existing LLM selection methods and surpasses the strongest methods by a large margin of 15.38% and 9.83% under two simulation strategies. On the PersonaRoute-Bench with 1,000 users, it further surpasses the best methods by 16.19% and 59.69% while maintaining higher efficiency.

The use of vocal biomarkers to support the early diagnosis of PD presents a non-invasive, low-cost, and accessible alternative in clinical settings. Thus, the objective of this cross-sectional study was to consistently evaluate the effectiveness of a Deep Neural Network (DNN) in distinguishing individuals with Parkinson's disease from healthy controls, in comparison with traditional Machine Learning (ML) methods, using vocal biomarkers. Two publicly available voice datasets were used. Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were extracted from the samples, and model robustness was assessed using a validation strategy with 1000 independent random executions. Performance was evaluated using classification statistics. Since normality assumptions were not satisfied, non-parametric tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Bonferroni post-hoc tests) were applied to verify whether the tested classification models were similar or different in the classification of PD. With an average accuracy of $98.65\\%$ and $92.11\\%$ on the Italian Voice dataset and Parkinson's Telemonitoring dataset, respectively, the DNN demonstrated superior performance and efficiency compared to traditional ML models, while also achieving competitive results when benchmarked against relevant studies. Overall, this study confirms the efficiency of DNNs and emphasizes their potential to provide greater accuracy and reliability for the early detection of neurodegenerative diseases using voice-based biomarkers.",

To address this question in the auditory domain, we quantified the alignment between the internal representations of 36 different audio models and brain activity from two independent fMRI datasets. Using voxel-wise and component-wise regression, and representation similarity analysis (RSA), we found that recent self-supervised audio models with strong performance in diverse downstream tasks are better predictors of auditory cortex activity than older and more specialized models. To assess the quality of the audio representations, we evaluated these models in 6 auditory tasks from the HEAREval benchmark, spanning music, speech, and environmental sounds. This revealed strong positive Pearson correlations ($r>0.7$) between a model's overall task performance and its alignment with brain representations. Finally, we analyzed the evolution of the similarity between audio and brain representations during the pretraining of EnCodecMAE. We discovered that brain similarity increases progressively and emerges early during pretraining, despite the model not being explicitly optimized for this objective. This suggests that brain-like representations can be an emergent byproduct of learning to reconstruct missing information from naturalistic audio data.",

While bioacoustic emissions have classified various aquatic species using Artificial Intelligence (AI) models, this research specifically uses H. gammarus bioacoustics (buzzing/carapace vibrations) to classify lobsters by age (juvenile/adult) and sex (male/female). The dataset was collected at Johnshaven, Scotland, using hydrophones in concrete tanks. We explored the efficacy of Deep Learning (DL) models (1D-CNN, 1D-DCNN) and six Machine Learning (ML) models (SVM, k-NN, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost, MLP). Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs) were used as features. For age classification (adult vs. juvenile), most models achieved over 97% accuracy (Naive Bayes: 91.31%). For sex classification, all models except Naive Bayes surpassed 93.23%. These strong results demonstrate the potential of supervised ML and DL to extract age- and sex-related features from lobster sounds.

        "summary": "Ordinal classification has been widely applied in many high-stakes applications, e.g., medical imaging and diagnosis, where reliable uncertainty quantification (UQ) is essential for decision making. Conformal prediction (CP) is a general UQ framework that provides statistically valid guarantees, which is especially useful in practice. However, prior ordinal CP methods mainly focus on heuristic algorithms or restrictively require the underlying model to predict a unimodal distribution over ordinal labels. Consequently, they provide limited insight into coverage-efficiency trade-offs, or a model-agnostic and distribution-free nature favored by CP methods. To this end, we fill this gap by propose an ordinal-CP method that is model-agnostic and provides instance-level optimal prediction intervals. Specifically, we formulate conformal ordinal classification as a minimum-length covering problem at the instance level. To solve this problem, we develop a sliding-window algorithm that is optimal on each calibration data, with only a linear time complexity in K, the number of label candidates. The local optimality per instance further also improves predictive efficiency in expectation. Moreover, we propose a length-regularized variant that shrinks prediction set size while preserving coverage. Experiments on four benchmark datasets from diverse domains are conducted to demonstrate the significantly improved predictive efficiency of the proposed methods over baselines (by 15% decrease on average over four datasets).",

Patient data included diagnoses, vital signs, laboratories, medications and procedures extracted from in-hospital EHRs. The models were evaluated on three one-year prediction tasks: clinical instability (a readmission phenotype) after initial HF hospitalization, mortality after initial HF hospitalization and mortality after latest hospitalization. Ablations account for modifications of the EHR-based input patient sequence, architectural model configurations, and temporal preprocessing techniques for data collection. Llama achieves the highest predictive discrimination, best calibration, and showed robustness across all tasks, followed by Mambas. Both architectures demonstrate efficient representation learning, with tiny configurations surpassing other large-scaled Transformers. At equal model size, Llama and Mambas achieve superior performance using 25% less training data.

Federated Learning has emerged as a promising remedy to these challenges by decentralizing model training to edge devices or parties, effectively addressing privacy concerns and resource limitations. Nevertheless, the presence of statistical heterogeneity in non-Independently and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data across different parties poses a significant hurdle to the effectiveness of FL.

        "summary": "Multiple Instance Learning (MIL) tasks impose a strict logical constraint: a bag is labeled positive if and only if at least one instance within it is positive. While this iff constraint aligns with many real-world applications, recent work has shown that most deep learning-based MIL approaches violate it, leading to inflated performance metrics and poor generalization. We propose a novel MIL framework based on Vector Symbolic Architectures (VSAs), which provide a differentiable mechanism for performing symbolic operations in high-dimensional space. Our method encodes the MIL assumption directly into the model's structure by representing instances and concepts as nearly orthogonal high-dimensional vectors and using algebraic operations to enforce the iff constraint during classification. To bridge the gap between raw data and VSA representations, we design a learned encoder that transforms input instances into VSA-compatible vectors while preserving key distributional properties. Our approach, which includes a VSA-driven MaxNetwork classifier, achieves state-of-the-art results for a valid MIL model on standard MIL benchmarks and medical imaging datasets, outperforming existing methods while maintaining strict adherence to the MIL formulation. This work offers a principled, interpretable, and effective alternative to existing MIL approaches that rely on learned heuristics.",

        "summary": "Multimodal large language models suffer from substantial inference overhead since multimodal KV Cache grows proportionally with the visual input length. Existing multimodal KV Cache compression methods mostly rely on attention score to reduce cache size, which makes them are incompatible with established efficient attention kernels (e.g., FlashAttention) and ignores the contribution of value vectors to the attention output. In this work, we revisit multimodal KV Cache compression from the perspective of the KV matrices' distribution. First, we observe that frequency-domain energy of multimodal KV matrices is predominantly concentrated in low-frequency and extract this principal energy via a low-pass filter. Further, we find that removing KV pairs that deviate substantially from this principal energy leads to a pronounced performance drop, which we define as Outlier KVs. Considering Outlier KVs are more likely to encode features critical for inference, we propose FlashCache, a frequency-domain-guided, Outlier-KV-aware KV Cache compression framework. First, we introduce an Outlier KV Recognition Module that models the principal component of multimodal KV matrices in the frequency domain and preferentially retains KV pairs that significantly deviate from it. Furthermore, Dynamic Budget Allocation Module is designed to adaptively determine the per-layer KV Cache size to retain more Outlier KVs. Experiments on multiple MLLMs and benchmarks demonstrate that FlashCache outperforms state-of-the-art multimoal KV compression methods, achieving up to 1.69 times faster decoding with 80% lower KV memory usage while maintaining task performance.",

        "summary": "Recently, structure-text contrastive learning has shown promising performance on text-attributed graphs by leveraging the complementary strengths of graph neural networks and language models. However, existing methods typically rely on homophily assumptions in similarity estimation and hard optimization objectives, which limit their applicability to heterophilic graphs. Although existing methods can mitigate heterophily through structural adjustments or neighbor aggregation, they usually treat textual embeddings as static targets, leading to suboptimal alignment. In this work, we identify the multi-granular heterophily in text-attributed graphs, including complete heterophily, partial heterophily, and latent homophily, which makes structure-text alignment particularly challenging due to mixed, noisy, and missing semantic correlations. To achieve flexible and bidirectional alignment, we propose GCL-OT, a novel graph contrastive learning framework with optimal transport, equipped with tailored mechanisms for each type of heterophily. Specifically, for partial heterophily, we design a RealSoftMax-based similarity estimator to emphasize key neighbor-word interactions while easing background noise. For complete heterophily, we introduce a prompt-based filter that adaptively excludes irrelevant noise during optimal transport alignment. Furthermore, we incorporate OT-guided soft supervision to uncover potential neighbors with similar semantics, enhancing the learning of latent homophily. Theoretical analysis shows that GCL-OT can improve the mutual information bound and Bayes error guarantees. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks show that GCL-OT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness and robustness.",

Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have excelled at understanding natural language and integrating cross-modal signals, sparking interest in their potential for graph reasoning. Recent work has explored this by either designing template-based graph templates or using graph neural networks (GNNs) to encode structural information. In this study, we investigate how different strategies for encoding graph structure affect LLM performance on text-attributed graphs. Surprisingly, our systematic experiments reveal that: (i) LLMs leveraging only node textual descriptions already achieve strong performance across tasks; and (ii) most structural encoding strategies offer marginal or even negative gains. We show that explicit structural priors are often unnecessary and, in some cases, counterproductive when powerful language models are involved. This represents a significant departure from traditional graph learning paradigms and highlights the need to rethink how structure should be represented and utilized in the LLM era. Our study is to systematically challenge the foundational assumption that structure is inherently beneficial for LLM-based graph reasoning, opening the door to new, semantics-driven approaches for graph learning.",

        "summary": "Time-series forecasting is fundamental across many domains, yet training accurate models often requires large-scale datasets and substantial computational resources. Dataset distillation offers a promising alternative by synthesizing compact datasets that preserve the learning behavior of full data. However, extending dataset distillation to time-series forecasting is non-trivial due to two fundamental challenges: 1.temporal bias from strong autocorrelation, which leads to distorted value-term alignment between teacher and student models; and 2.insufficient diversity among synthetic samples, arising from the absence of explicit categorical priors to regularize trajectory variety. In this work, we propose DDTime, a lightweight and plug-in distillation framework built upon first-order condensation decomposition. To tackle Challenge 1, it revisits value-term alignment through temporal statistics and introduces a frequency-domain alignment mechanism to mitigate autocorrelation-induced bias, ensuring spectral consistency and temporal fidelity. To address Challenge 2, we further design an inter-sample regularization inspired by the information bottleneck principle, which enhances diversity and maximizes information density across synthetic trajectories. The combined objective is theoretically compatible with a wide range of condensation paradigms and supports stable first-order optimization. Extensive experiments on 20 benchmark datasets and diverse forecasting architectures demonstrate that DDTime consistently outperforms existing distillation methods, achieving about 30% relative accuracy gains while introducing about 2.49% computational overhead. All code and distilled datasets will be released.",

Augmenting the training data with two different filters before training the neural networks has no performance degradation a priori as compared to a neural network trained with one filter. A posteriori, neural networks trained with two different filters are far more robust across two different LES codes with different numerical schemes. In addition, by ablating away the higher order terms input into the neural network, the a priori versus a posteriori performance changes become less apparent.

Trouble Reports (TRs), which document issues in Ericsson's production system, play a critical role in facilitating the timely resolution of software faults. However, the complexity and volume of TR data, along with the presence of diverse criteria that reflect different aspects of each fault, present challenges for retrieval systems. Building on prior work at Ericsson, which utilized a two-stage workflow, comprising Initial Retrieval (IR) and Re-Ranking (RR) stages, this study investigates different TR observation criteria and their impact on the performance of retrieval models. We propose \\textbf{CREST} (\\textbf{C}riteria-specific \\textbf{R}etrieval via \\textbf{E}nsemble of \\textbf{S}pecialized \\textbf{T}R models), a criterion-driven retrieval approach that leverages specialized models for different TR fields to improve both effectiveness and interpretability, thereby enabling quicker fault resolution and supporting software maintenance. CREST utilizes specialized models trained on specific TR criteria and aggregates their outputs to capture diverse and complementary signals. This approach leads to enhanced retrieval accuracy, better calibration of predicted scores, and improved interpretability by providing relevance scores for each criterion, helping users understand why specific TRs were retrieved. Using a subset of Ericsson's internal TRs, this research demonstrates that criterion-specific models significantly outperform a single model approach across key evaluation metrics. This highlights the importance of all targeted criteria used in this study for optimizing the performance of retrieval systems.",

        "summary": "Robotic Foundation Models (RFMs) hold great promise as generalist, end-to-end systems for robot control. Yet their ability to generalize across new environments, tasks, and embodiments remains limited. We argue that a major bottleneck lies in their foundations: most RFMs are built by fine-tuning internet-pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However, these VLMs are trained on 2D image-language tasks and lack the 3D spatial reasoning inherently required for embodied control in the 3D world. Bridging this gap directly with large-scale robotic data is costly and difficult to scale. Instead, we propose to enrich easy-to-collect non-robotic image data with 3D annotations and enhance a pretrained VLM with 3D understanding capabilities. Following this strategy, we train SPEAR-VLM, a 3D-aware VLM that infers object coordinates in 3D space from a single 2D image. Building on SPEAR-VLM, we introduce our main contribution, $~\\textbf{SPEAR-1}$: a robotic foundation model that integrates grounded 3D perception with language-instructed embodied control. Trained on $\\sim$45M frames from 24 Open X-Embodiment datasets, SPEAR-1 outperforms or matches state-of-the-art models such as $π_0$-FAST and $π_{0.5}$, while it uses 20$\\times$ fewer robot demonstrations.

However, natural examples of many behaviours are rare, forcing researchers to rely on synthetic or off-policy LLM responses for training probes. We systematically evaluate how the use of synthetic and off-policy data influences probe generalisation across eight distinct LLM behaviours. Testing linear and attention probes across multiple LLMs, we find that the response generation strategy can significantly affect probe performance, though the magnitude of this effect varies by behaviour. We find that successful generalisation from off-policy data, to test sets where the model is incentivised to produce the target behaviour, is predictive of successful on-policy generalisation. Leveraging this result, we predict that Deception and Sandbagging probes may fail to generalise from off-policy to on-policy data when used in real monitoring scenarios. Notably, shifts in the training data domain still cause even larger performance degradation, with different-domain test scores being consistently lower than the same-domain ones. These results indicate that, in the absence of on-policy data, using same-domain off-policy data yields more reliable probes than using on-policy data from a different domain, emphasizing the need for methods that can better handle distribution shifts in LLM monitoring.",

To address this limitation, we propose non-parametric probabilistic robustness (NPPR), a more practical PR metric that does not rely on any predefined perturbation distribution.

We further develop an NPPR estimator based on a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) heads and bicubic up-sampling, covering various input-dependent and input-independent perturbation scenarios. Theoretical analyses establish the relationships among AR, PR, and NPPR. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny ImageNet across ResNet18/50, WideResNet50 and VGG16 validate NPPR as a more practical robustness metric, showing up to 40\\% more conservative (lower) PR estimates compared to assuming those common perturbation distributions used in state-of-the-arts.",

        "summary": "The physics programs of current and future collider experiments necessitate the development of surrogate simulators for calorimeter showers. While much progress has been made in the development of generative models for this task, they have typically been evaluated in simplified scenarios and for single particles. This is particularly true for the challenging task of highly granular calorimeter simulation. For the first time, this work studies the use of highly granular generative calorimeter surrogates in a realistic simulation application. We introduce DDML, a generic library which enables the combination of generative calorimeter surrogates with realistic detectors implemented using the DD4hep toolkit. We compare two different generative models - one operating on a regular grid representation, and the other using a less common point cloud approach. In order to disentangle methodological details from model performance, we provide comparisons to idealized simulators which directly sample representations of different resolutions from the full simulation ground-truth. We then systematically evaluate model performance on post-reconstruction benchmarks for electromagnetic shower simulation. Beginning with a typical single particle study, we introduce a first multi-particle benchmark based on di-photon separations, before studying a first full-physics benchmark based on hadronic decays of the tau lepton. Our results indicate that models operating on a point cloud can achieve a favorable balance between speed and accuracy for highly granular calorimeter simulation compared to those which operate on a regular grid representation.",

        "summary": "This paper presents a novel framework combining group equivariant convolutional neural networks (G-CNNs) with equivariant-aware structured pruning to produce compact, transformation-invariant models for resource-constrained environments. Equivariance to rotations is achieved through the C4 cyclic group via the e2cnn library,enabling consistent performance under geometric transformations while reducing computational overhead. Our approach introduces structured pruning that preserves equivariant properties by analyzing e2cnn layer structure and applying neuron-level pruning to fully connected components. To mitigate accuracy degradation, we implement adaptive fine-tuning that automatically triggers when accuracy drop exceeds 2%, using early stopping and learning rate scheduling for efficient recovery. The framework includes dynamic INT8 quantization and a comprehensive pipeline encompassing training, knowledge distillation, structured pruning, fine-tuning, and quantization. We evaluate our method on satellite imagery (EuroSAT) and standard benchmarks (CIFAR-10, Rotated MNIST) demonstrating effectiveness across diverse domains. Experimental results show 29.3% parameter reduction with significant accuracy recovery, demonstrating that structured pruning of equivariant networks achieves substantial compression while maintaining geometric robustness. Our pipeline provides a reproducible framework for optimizing equivariant models, bridging the gap between group-theoretic network design and practical deployment constraints, with particular relevance to satellite imagery analysis and geometric vision tasks.",

However, standard deep learning suffers from a fundamental issue: loss of plasticity, in which networks gradually lose their ability to learn from new data. Here we show that quantum learning models naturally overcome this limitation, preserving plasticity over long timescales. We demonstrate this advantage systematically across a broad spectrum of tasks from multiple learning paradigms, including supervised learning and reinforcement learning, and diverse data modalities, from classical high-dimensional images to quantum-native datasets. Although classical models exhibit performance degradation correlated with unbounded weight and gradient growth, quantum neural networks maintain consistent learning capabilities regardless of the data or task. We identify the origin of the advantage as the intrinsic physical constraints of quantum models. Unlike classical networks where unbounded weight growth leads to landscape ruggedness or saturation, the unitary constraints confine the optimization to a compact manifold. Our results suggest that the utility of quantum computing in machine learning extends beyond potential speedups, offering a robust pathway for building adaptive artificial intelligence and lifelong learners.",

We assess three key dimensions: detection effectiveness, interpretability of encoded information, and cross-modal complementarity. We find that most self-supervised features capture deepfake-relevant information, and that this information is complementary. Moreover, models primarily attend to semantically meaningful regions rather than spurious artifacts. Yet none generalize reliably across datasets. This generalization failure likely stems from dataset characteristics, not from the features themselves latching onto superficial patterns. These results expose both the promise and fundamental challenges of self-supervised representations for deepfake detection: while they learn meaningful patterns, achieving robust cross-domain performance remains elusive.",

While deterministic models such as FuXi, GraphCast, and SFNO have achieved competitive forecast skill relative to numerical weather prediction, their ability to represent uncertainty and capture extremes is still limited. This study investigates how state of the art deterministic artificial intelligence based models respond to initial-condition perturbations and evaluates the resulting ensembles in forecasting extremes. Using three perturbation strategies (Gaussian noise, Hemispheric Centered Bred Vectors, and Huge Ensembles), we generate 50 member ensembles for two major events in August 2022: the Pakistan floods and the China heatwave. Ensemble skill is assessed against ERA5 and compared with IFS ENS and the probabilistic AIFSENS model using deterministic and probabilistic metrics. Results show that flow dependent perturbations produce the most realistic ensemble spread and highest probabilistic skill, narrowing but not closing the performance gap with numerical weather prediction ensembles. Across variables, artificial intelligence based weather models capture temperature extremes more effectively than precipitation. These findings demonstrate that input perturbations can extend deterministic models toward probabilistic forecasting, paving the way for approaches that combine flow dependent perturbations with generative or latent-space uncertainty modeling for reliable artificial intelligence-driven early warning systems.",

Our findings demonstrate that reasoning can ground raster prediction models, improving both generalization and interpretability. To our knowledge, this is the first framework to (1) demonstrate that language-based reasoning can improve generalization in visual generation, (2) propose a high-resolution wildfire risk model that can be applied across continents, and (3) enable systematic studies of robust cross-continental generalization for multimodal fire risk models.

While intrinsic reward methods have demonstrated effectiveness in single-agent rein-forcement learning scenarios, their application to multi-agent reinforcement learn-ing (MARL) remains problematic. The primary difficulties stem from two fac-tors: (1) the exponential sparsity of joint action trajectories that lead to rewards as the exploration space expands, and (2) existing methods often fail to account for joint actions that can influence team states. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Mutual Intrinsic Reward (MIR), a simple yet effective enhancement strategy for MARL with extremely sparse rewards like episodic rewards. MIR incentivizes individual agents to explore actions that affect their teammates, and when combined with original strategies, effectively stimulates team exploration and improves algorithm performance. For comprehensive experimental valida-tion, we extend the representative single-agent MiniGrid environment to create MiniGrid-MA, a series of MARL environments with sparse rewards. Our evalu-ation compares the proposed method against state-of-the-art approaches in the MiniGrid-MA setting, with experimental results demonstrating superior perfor-mance.",

This work proposes the OmniLens++ framework, which resolves two challenges that hinder the generalization ability of existing pipelines: the difficulty of scaling data and the absence of prior guidance characterizing optical degradation. To improve data scalability, we expand the design specifications to increase the degradation diversity of the lens source, and we sample a more uniform distribution by quantifying the spatial-variation patterns and severity of optical degradation. In terms of model design, to leverage the Point Spread Functions (PSFs), which intuitively describe optical degradation, as guidance in a blind paradigm, we propose the Latent PSF Representation (LPR). The VQVAE framework is introduced to learn latent features of LensLib's PSFs, which is assisted by modeling the optical degradation process to constrain the learning of degradation priors. Experiments on diverse aberrations of real-world lenses and synthetic LensLib show that OmniLens++ exhibits state-of-the-art generalization capacity in blind aberration correction. Beyond performance, the AODLibpro is verified as a scalable foundation for more effective training across diverse aberrations, and LPR can further tap the potential of large-scale LensLib.

First, we build a layer-aware MAC energy model that combines per-layer activation statistics with an MSB-Hamming distance grouping of 22-bit partial sum transitions, and integrate it with a tile-level systolic mapping to estimate convolution-layer energy. On top of this model, we introduce an energy accuracy co-optimized weight selection algorithm within quantization aware training and an energy-prioritized layer-wise schedule that compresses high energy layers more aggressively under a global accuracy constraint.

While extensive research has explored the use of supervised Machine Learning for attack detection and characterisation, these methods require accurately labelled datasets, which are very costly to obtain. Moreover, existing public datasets have limited and/or outdated attacks, and many of them suffer from mislabelled data. To reduce the reliance on labelled data, we propose AutoGraphAD, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a Heterogeneous Variational Graph Autoencoder. AutoGraphAD operates on heterogeneous graphs, made from connection and IP nodes that capture network activity within a time window. The model is trained using unsupervised and contrastive learning, without relying on any labelled data. The reconstruction, structural loss, and KL divergence are then weighted and combined in an anomaly score that is then used for anomaly detection. Overall, AutoGraphAD yields the same, and in some cases better, results than previous unsupervised approaches, such as Anomal-E, but without requiring costly downstream anomaly detectors. As a result, AutoGraphAD achieves around 1.18 orders of magnitude faster training and 1.03 orders of magnitude faster inference, which represents a significant advantage for operational deployment.",

In this work, we dissect PQC based QRL architectures through a systematic experimental evaluation of three aspects recurrently identified as critical: (i) data embedding strategies, with Data Reuploading (DR) as an advanced approach; (ii) ansatz design, particularly the role of entanglement; and (iii) post-processing blocks after quantum measurement, with a focus on the underexplored Output Reuse (OR) technique. Using a unified PPO-CartPole framework, we perform controlled comparisons between hybrid and classical agents under identical conditions. Our results show that OR, though purely classical, exhibits distinct behaviour in hybrid pipelines, that DR improves trainability and stability, and that stronger entanglement can degrade optimisation, offsetting classical gains. Together, these findings provide controlled empirical evidence of the interplay between quantum and classical contributions, and establish a reproducible framework for systematic benchmarking and component-wise analysis in QRL.",

However, most existing ML-based methods rely on large, accurately labeled datasets with location information, which are often difficult and costly to obtain. This paper proposes a generative framework to recover location labels directly from sequences of sparse channel state information (CSI) measurements, without explicit location labels for radio map construction. Instead of directly storing raw CSI, we learn a compact low-dimensional radio map embedding and leverage a generative model to reconstruct the high-dimensional CSI. Specifically, to address the uncertainty of sparse CSI, a dual-scale feature extraction scheme is designed to enhance feature representation by jointly exploiting correlations from angular space and across neighboring samples. We develop a hybrid recurrent-convolutional encoder to learn mobility patterns, which combines a truncation strategy and multi-scale convolutions in the recurrent neural network (RNN) to ensure feature robustness against short-term fluctuations. Unlike conventional Gaussian priors in latent space, we embed a learnable radio map to capture the location information by encoding high-level positional features from CSI measurements. Finally, a diffusion-based generative decoder reconstructs the full CSI with high fidelity by conditioning on the positional features in the radio map. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed model can improve localization accuracy by over 30% and achieve a 20% capacity gain in non-line-of-sight (NLOS) scenarios compared with model-based Kalman filter approaches.",

However, applying it to modern flow matching models is challenging because of its deterministic sampling paradigm. Current methods address this issue by converting Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) to Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs), which introduce stochasticity. However, this SDE-based GRPO suffers from issues of inefficient credit assignment and incompatibility with high-order solvers for fewer-step sampling. In this paper, we first reinterpret existing SDE-based GRPO methods from a distance optimization perspective, revealing their underlying mechanism as a form of contrastive learning. Based on this insight, we propose Neighbor GRPO, a novel alignment algorithm that completely bypasses the need for SDEs. Neighbor GRPO generates a diverse set of candidate trajectories by perturbing the initial noise conditions of the ODE and optimizes the model using a softmax distance-based surrogate leaping policy. We establish a theoretical connection between this distance-based objective and policy gradient optimization, rigorously integrating our approach into the GRPO framework. Our method fully preserves the advantages of deterministic ODE sampling, including efficiency and compatibility with high-order solvers. We further introduce symmetric anchor sampling for computational efficiency and group-wise quasi-norm reweighting to address reward flattening. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Neighbor GRPO significantly outperforms SDE-based counterparts in terms of training cost, convergence speed, and generation quality.",

        "summary": "Enforcing alignment between the internal representations of diffusion or flow-based generative models and those of pretrained self-supervised encoders has recently been shown to provide a powerful inductive bias, improving both convergence and sample quality. In this work, we extend this idea to inverse problems, where pretrained generative models are employed as priors. We propose applying representation alignment (REPA) between diffusion or flow-based models and a pretrained self-supervised visual encoder, such as DINOv2, to guide the reconstruction process at inference time. Although ground-truth signals are unavailable in inverse problems, we show that aligning model representations with approximate target features can substantially enhance reconstruction fidelity and perceptual realism. We provide theoretical results showing (a) the relation between the REPA regularization and a divergence measure in the DINOv2 embedding space, and (b) how REPA updates steer the model's internal representations toward those of the clean image. These results offer insights into the role of REPA in improving perceptual fidelity. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of our approach by integrating it into multiple state-of-the-art inverse problem solvers. Extensive experiments on super-resolution, box inpainting, Gaussian deblurring, and motion deblurring confirm that our method consistently improves reconstruction quality across tasks, while also providing substantial efficiency gains by reducing the number of required discretization steps without compromising the performance of the underlying solver.",

BITS for GAPS supports serial hybrid modeling, where known physics governs part of the system and residual dynamics are represented as a latent function inferred from data. A Gaussian process prior is placed over the latent function, with hierarchical priors on its hyperparameters to encode physically meaningful structure in the predictive posterior. To guide data acquisition, we derive entropy-based acquisition functions that quantify expected information gain from candidate input locations, identifying samples most informative for training the surrogate. Specifically, we obtain a closed-form expression for the differential entropy of the predictive posterior and establish a tractable lower bound for efficient evaluation. These derivations approximate the predictive posterior as a finite, uniformly weighted mixture of Gaussian processes. We demonstrate the framework's utility by modeling activity coefficients in vapor-liquid equilibrium systems, embedding the surrogate into extended Raoult's law for distillation design. Numerical results show that entropy-guided sampling improves sample efficiency by targeting regions of high uncertainty and potential information gain. This accelerates surrogate convergence, enhances predictive accuracy in non-ideal regimes, and preserves physical consistency. Overall, BITS for GAPS provides an efficient, interpretable, and uncertainty-aware framework for hybrid modeling of complex physical systems.",

However, they often require inner-loop iterations to solve the lower-level (LL) problem and small outer-loop step sizes to handle the increased smoothness induced by large penalty terms, leading to suboptimal complexity. This work considers the general BLO problems with coupled constraints (CCs) and leverages a novel penalty reformulation that decouples the upper- and lower-level variables. This yields an improved analysis of the smoothness constant, enabling larger step sizes and reduced iteration complexity for Penalty-Based Gradient Descent algorithms in ALTernating fashion (ALT-PBGD). Building on the insight of reduced smoothness, we propose PBGD-Free, a novel fully single-loop algorithm that avoids inner loops for the uncoupled constraint BLO. For BLO with CCs, PBGD-Free employs an efficient inner-loop with substantially reduced iteration complexity. Furthermore, we propose a novel curvature condition describing the \"flatness\" of the upper-level objective with respect to the LL variable. This condition relaxes the traditional upper-level Lipschitz requirement, enables smaller penalty constant choices, and results in a negligible penalty gradient term during upper-level variable updates. We provide rigorous convergence analysis and validate the method's efficacy through hyperparameter optimization for support vector machines and fine-tuning of large language models.",

        "summary": "Membership inference attacks (MIAs) against machine learning (ML) models aim to determine whether a given data point was part of the model training data. These attacks may pose significant privacy risks to individuals whose sensitive data were used for training, which motivates the use of defenses such as differential privacy, often at the cost of high accuracy losses. MIAs exploit the differences in the behavior of a model when making predictions on samples it has seen during training (members) versus those it has not seen (non-members). Several studies have pointed out that model overfitting is the major factor contributing to these differences in behavior and, consequently, to the success of MIAs. However, the literature also shows that even non-overfitted ML models can leak information about a small subset of their training data. In this paper, we investigate the root causes of membership inference vulnerabilities beyond traditional overfitting concerns and suggest targeted defenses. We empirically analyze the characteristics of the training data samples vulnerable to MIAs in models that are not overfitted (and hence able to generalize). Our findings reveal that these samples are often outliers within their classes (e.g., noisy or hard to classify). We then propose potential defensive strategies to protect these vulnerable samples and enhance the privacy-preserving capabilities of ML models.

We find this trade-off stems from rigid alignment strategies that force unsafe concepts toward single, predefined safe targets, disrupting the model's learned semantic structure. To address this, we propose a proximity-aware approach: redirecting unsafe concepts to their semantically closest safe alternatives to minimize representational change. We introduce SaFeR-CLIP, a fine-tuning framework that applies this principle of minimal intervention. SaFeR-CLIP successfully reconciles safety and performance, recovering up to 8.0% in zero-shot accuracy over prior methods while maintaining robust safety. To support more rigorous evaluation, we also contribute NSFW-Caps, a new benchmark of 1,000 highly-aligned pairs for testing safety under distributional shift.

        "summary": "Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.",

        "summary": "LLM-driven agents, particularly those using general frameworks like ReAct or human-inspired role-playing, often struggle in specialized domains that necessitate rigorously structured workflows. Fields such as remote sensing, requiring specialized tools (e.g., correction, spectral indices calculation), and multi-step procedures (e.g., numerous intermediate products and optional steps), significantly challenge generalized approaches. To address this gap, we introduce a novel agent design framework centered on a Hierarchical Task Abstraction Mechanism (HTAM). Specifically, HTAM moves beyond emulating social roles, instead structuring multi-agent systems into a logical hierarchy that mirrors the intrinsic task-dependency graph of a given domain. This task-centric architecture thus enforces procedural correctness and decomposes complex problems into sequential layers, where each layer's sub-agents operate on the outputs of the preceding layers. We instantiate this framework as EarthAgent, a multi-agent system tailored for complex geospatial analysis. To evaluate such complex planning capabilities, we build GeoPlan-bench, a comprehensive benchmark of realistic, multi-step geospatial planning tasks. It is accompanied by a suite of carefully designed metrics to evaluate tool selection, path similarity, and logical completeness. Experiments show that EarthAgent substantially outperforms a range of established single- and multi-agent systems. Our work demonstrates that aligning agent architecture with a domain's intrinsic task structure is a critical step toward building robust and reliable specialized autonomous systems.",

The ontology ensures semantic precision and reusability by aligning with foundational ontologies and best practices in modular design. Two complementary lines of experimentation demonstrate its applicability: (i) coupling the ontology with Large Language Models (LLMs) via Logic Augmented Generation (LAG) to assess the contribution of ontological grounding to inferential coherence and consistency; and (ii) integrating the ontology within the Semas reasoning platform, which implements the Triples-to-Beliefs-to-Triples (T2B2T) paradigm, enabling a bidirectional flow between RDF triples and agent mental states. Together, these experiments illustrate how the BDI Ontology acts as both a conceptual and operational bridge between declarative and procedural intelligence, paving the way for cognitively grounded, explainable, and semantically interoperable multi-agent and neuro-symbolic systems operating within the Web of Data.",

In this work, we propose a method for multi-modal patient-level information extraction that leverages both the tabular features available in the patient's EHR (using an expert-informed Bayesian network) as well as clinical notes describing the patient's symptoms (using neural text classifiers). We propose the use of virtual evidence augmented with a consistency node to provide an interpretable, probabilistic fusion of the models' predictions. The consistency node improves the calibration of the final predictions compared to virtual evidence alone, allowing the Bayesian network to better adjust the neural classifier's output to handle missing information and resolve contradictions between the tabular and text data. We show the potential of our method on the SimSUM dataset, a simulated benchmark linking tabular EHRs with clinical notes through expert knowledge.",

To clarify this structure, we reinterpret the role of diffusion in inverse problem solving as an initialization stage within an expectation--maximization (EM)--style framework, where the diffusion stage and the data-driven refinement are fully decoupled. We introduce \\textbf{DAPS++}, which allows the likelihood term to guide inference more directly while maintaining numerical stability and providing insight into why unified diffusion trajectories remain effective in practice.

        "summary": "Scaling test-time computation improves performance across different tasks on large language models (LLMs), which has also been extended to tool-augmented agents. For these agents, scaling involves not only \"thinking\" in tokens but also \"acting\" via tool calls. The number of tool calls directly bounds the agent's interaction with the external environment. However, we find that simply granting agents a larger tool-call budget fails to improve performance, as they lack \"budget awareness\" and quickly hit a performance ceiling. To address this, we study how to scale such agents effectively under explicit tool-call budgets, focusing on web search agents. We first introduce the Budget Tracker, a lightweight plug-in that provides the agent with continuous budget awareness, enabling simple yet effective scaling. We further develop BATS (Budget Aware Test-time Scaling), an advanced framework that leverages this awareness to dynamically adapt its planning and verification strategy, deciding whether to \"dig deeper\" on a promising lead or \"pivot\" to new paths based on remaining resources. To analyze cost-performance scaling in a controlled manner, we formalize a unified cost metric that jointly accounts for token and tool consumption. We provide the first systematic study on budget-constrained agents, showing that budget-aware methods produce more favorable scaling curves and push the cost-performance Pareto frontier. Our work offers empirical insights toward a more transparent and principled understanding of scaling in tool-augmented agents.",

However, current approaches largely conceptualize scientific discovery as a solitary optimization or search process, overlooking that knowledge production is inherently a social and historical endeavor. Human scientific insight stems from two distinct yet interconnected sources. First is the individual cognitive trajectory, where a researcher's unique insight is shaped by their evolving research history and stylistic preferences; another is the collective disciplinary memory, where knowledge is sedimented into vast, interconnected networks of citations and concepts. Existing LLMs still struggle to represent these structured, high-fidelity cognitive and social contexts. To bridge this gap, we introduce MirrorMind, a hierarchical cognitive architecture that integrates dual-memory representations within a three-level framework. The Individual Level constructs high-fidelity cognitive models of individual researchers by capturing their episodic, semantic, and persona memories; the Domain Level maps collective knowledge into structured disciplinary concept graphs; and the Interdisciplinary Level that acts as an orthogonal orchestration engine. Crucially, our architecture separates memory storage from agentic execution, enabling AI scientist agents to flexibly access individual memories for unique perspectives or collective structures to reason. We evaluate MirrorMind across four comprehensive tasks, including author-level cognitive simulation, complementary reasoning, cross-disciplinary collaboration promotion, and multi-agent scientific problem solving. The results show that by integrating individual cognitive depth with collective disciplinary breadth, MirrorMind moves beyond simple fact retrieval toward structural, personalized, and insight-generating scientific reasoning.",

Building on this analysis, the HDR framework innovatively integrates two complementary components: (1) a Temporal Difference Reward (TRD) based on a global potential function, which utilizes the evolutionary trend of potential energy to ensure optimal policy invariance and consistency with long-term objectives; and (2) an Action Gradient Reward (ARG), which directly measures the marginal utility of actions to provide a local guidance signal with a high SNR. Furthermore, we formulate the cooperative driving problem as a Multi-Agent Partially Observable Markov Game (POMDPG) with a time-varying agent set and provide a complete instantiation scheme for HDR within this framework. Extensive experiments conducted using both online planning (MCTS) and Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (QMIX, MAPPO, MADDPG) algorithms demonstrate that the HDR mechanism significantly improves convergence speed and policy stability. The results confirm that HDR guides agents to learn high-quality cooperative policies that effectively balance traffic efficiency and safety.",

This study compared image generation in human participants (Visual Artists and Non Artists) and using an image generation AI model (two prompting conditions with varying human input: high for Human Inspired, low for Self Guided). Human raters (N=255) and GPT4o evaluated the creativity of the resulting images. We found a clear creativity gradient, with Visual Artists being the most creative, followed by Non Artists, then Human Inspired generative AI, and finally Self Guided generative AI. Increased human guidance strongly improved GenAI's creative output, bringing its productions close to those of Non Artists. Notably, human and AI raters also showed vastly different creativity judgment patterns. These results suggest that, in contrast to language centered tasks, GenAI models may face unique challenges in visual domains, where creativity depends on perceptual nuance and contextual sensitivity, distinctly human capacities that may not be readily transferable from language models.",

Accurate pronunciation detection remains a key challenge in Arabic, particularly in the context of Quranic recitation, where subtle phonetic differences can alter meaning. Addressing this challenge, the present study proposes a transformer-based multimodal framework for Arabic phoneme mispronunciation detection that combines acoustic and textual representations to achieve higher precision and robustness. The framework integrates UniSpeech-derived acoustic embeddings with BERT-based textual embeddings extracted from Whisper transcriptions, creating a unified representation that captures both phonetic detail and linguistic context. To determine the most effective integration strategy, early, intermediate, and late fusion methods were implemented and evaluated on two datasets containing 29 Arabic phonemes, including eight hafiz sounds, articulated by 11 native speakers. Additional speech samples collected from publicly available YouTube recordings were incorporated to enhance data diversity and generalization. Model performance was assessed using standard evaluation metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, allowing a detailed comparison of the fusion strategies. Experimental findings show that the UniSpeech-BERT multimodal configuration provides strong results and that fusion-based transformer architectures are effective for phoneme-level mispronunciation detection. The study contributes to the development of intelligent, speaker-independent, and multimodal Computer-Aided Language Learning (CALL) systems, offering a practical step toward technology-supported Quranic pronunciation training and broader speech-based educational applications.",

They support diverse RS tasks including semantic segmentation, image classification, change detection, and visual question answering. However, selecting an appropriate remote sensing foundation model (RSFM) remains difficult due to scattered documentation, heterogeneous formats, and varied deployment constraints. We introduce the RSFM Database (RS-FMD), a structured resource covering over 150 RSFMs spanning multiple data modalities, resolutions, and learning paradigms. Built on RS-FMD, we present REMSA, the first LLM-based agent for automated RSFM selection from natural language queries. REMSA interprets user requirements, resolves missing constraints, ranks candidate models using in-context learning, and provides transparent justifications. We also propose a benchmark of 75 expert-verified RS query scenarios, producing 900 configurations under an expert-centered evaluation protocol. REMSA outperforms several baselines, including naive agents, dense retrieval, and unstructured RAG-based LLMs. It operates entirely on publicly available metadata and does not access private or sensitive data.",

In high-risk applications such as medical image analysis, this phenomenon may prevent models from using clinically meaningful features when making predictions, potentially leading to poor robustness and harm to patients. We demonstrate that different types of shortcuts (those that are diffuse and spread throughout the image, as well as those that are localized to specific areas) manifest distinctly across network layers and can, therefore, be more effectively targeted through mitigation strategies that target the intermediate layers. We propose a novel knowledge distillation framework that leverages a teacher network fine-tuned on a small subset of task-relevant data to mitigate shortcut learning in a student network trained on a large dataset corrupted with a bias feature. Through extensive experiments on CheXpert, ISIC 2017, and SimBA datasets using various architectures (ResNet-18, AlexNet, DenseNet-121, and 3D CNNs), we demonstrate consistent improvements over traditional Empirical Risk Minimization, augmentation-based bias-mitigation, and group-based bias-mitigation approaches. In many cases, we achieve comparable performance with a baseline model trained on bias-free data, even on out-of-distribution test data. Our results demonstrate the practical applicability of our approach to real-world medical imaging scenarios where bias annotations are limited and shortcut features are difficult to identify a priori.",

A key challenge in these domains is capturing interactions between channels, as each channel carries different information. While existing works have shown efficacy by treating each channel independently during tokenization, this approach naturally introduces a major computational bottleneck in the attention block - channel-wise comparisons leads to a quadratic growth in attention, resulting in excessive $\\text{FLOPs}$ and high training cost. In this work, we shift focus from efficacy to the overlooked efficiency challenge in cross-channel attention and ask: \"Is it necessary to model all channel interactions?\". Inspired by the philosophy of Sparse Mixture-of-Experts ($\\text{MoE}$), we propose MoE-ViT, a Mixture-of-Experts architecture for multi-channel images in $\\text{ViTs}$, which treats each channel as an expert and employs a lightweight router to select only the most relevant experts per patch for attention. Proof-of-concept experiments on real-world datasets - JUMP-CP and So2Sat - demonstrate that $\\text{MoE-ViT}$ achieves substantial efficiency gains without sacrificing, and in some cases enhancing, performance, making it a practical and attractive backbone for multi-channel imaging.",

This methodology emphasizes the representation of a diverse range of facial traits, ensuring adherence to characteristics permissible in identity card photographs. Furthermore, we introduce the Diverse and Inclusive Faces for Verification (DIF-V) dataset, comprising 27,780 images of 926 unique identities, designed as a benchmark for future research in face verification. Our analysis reveals that existing verification models exhibit biases toward certain genders and races, and notably, applying identity style modifications negatively impacts model performance.

Based on Statistical Wave Field Theory, we show that late reverberation perturbs phase components with white, uniformly distributed noise, except at low frequencies. Consequently, the wet phase carries limited useful information and is not essential for weakly supervised dereverberation. To validate this finding, we train dereverberation models under a recent weak supervision framework and demonstrate that performance can be significantly improved by excluding the reverberant phase from the loss function.",

Building on recent work that explores how AI companies engage in geopolitics, this position paper argues that some AI workers can be considered actors of geopolitics. It makes the timely case that governance alone cannot ensure responsible, ethical, or robust AI development and use, and greater attention should be paid to bottom-up interventions at the site of AI development. AI workers themselves should be situated as individual agents of change, especially when considering their potential to foster Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA).

We conduct a comprehensive analysis showing that current T2I models often produce culturally neutral or English-biased results under multilingual prompts. Analyses of two representative models indicate that the issue stems not from missing cultural knowledge but from insufficient activation of culture-related representations. We propose a probing method that localizes culture-sensitive signals to a small set of neurons in a few fixed layers. Guided by this finding, we introduce two complementary alignment strategies: (1) inference-time cultural activation that amplifies the identified neurons without backbone fine-tuned; and (2) layer-targeted cultural enhancement that updates only culturally relevant layers.

Well-known inverse kinematics (IK) techniques can provide mathematically exact solutions (when they exist) for joint configuration determination based solely on the fingertip pose, but often require post-hoc decision-making by considering the positions of all intermediate phalanges in the gripper's fingers, or rely on algorithms to numerically approximate solutions for more complex kinematics. In contrast, our method leverages machine learning to implicitly overcome these challenges. This is achieved through a Conditional Variational Auto-Encoder (CVAE), which takes point cloud data of key structural elements as input and reconstructs the corresponding joint configurations. We validate our approach on the MultiDex grasping dataset using the Allegro Hand, operating within 0.05 milliseconds and achieving accuracy comparable to state-of-the-art methods.

Acquiring such diverse scenarios from real-world point cloud data, especially for critical edge cases, is challenging, which restricts system generalization and robustness. Current methods rely on simulating point cloud data within handcrafted 3D virtual environments, which is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and often fails to fully capture the complexity of real-world scenes. To address some of these issues, this research proposes a novel approach that addresses the problem discussed by editing real-world LiDAR scans using semantic mask-based guidance to generate novel synthetic LiDAR point clouds. We incorporate range image projection and semantic mask conditioning to achieve diffusion-based generation. Point clouds are transformed to 2D range view images, which are used as an intermediate representation to enable semantic editing using convex hull-based semantic masks. These masks guide the generation process by providing information on the dimensions, orientations, and locations of objects in the real environment, ensuring geometric consistency and realism. This approach demonstrates high-quality LiDAR point cloud generation, capable of producing complex edge cases and dynamic scenes, as validated on the KITTI-360 dataset. This offers a cost-effective and scalable solution for generating diverse LiDAR data, a step toward improving the robustness of autonomous driving systems.",

Massive-scale AI models, which mimic the human brain's functionality, typically feature millions and even billions of parameters through data-intensive matrix multiplication tasks. While conventional Von-Neumann architectures struggle with the memory wall and the end of Moore's Law, these AI applications are migrating rapidly towards the edge, such as in robotics and unmanned aerial vehicles for surveillance, thereby adding more constraints to the hardware budget of AI architectures at the edge. Although in-memory computing has been proposed as a promising solution for the memory wall, both analog and digital in-memory computing architectures suffer from substantial degradation of the proposed benefits due to various design limitations. We propose a new digital in-memory stochastic computing architecture, DISCA, utilizing a compressed version of the quasi-stochastic Bent-Pyramid data format. DISCA inherits the same computational simplicity of analog computing, while preserving the same scalability, productivity, and reliability of digital systems. Post-layout modeling results of DISCA show an energy efficiency of 3.59 TOPS/W per bit at 500 MHz using a commercial 180nm CMOS technology. Therefore, DISCA significantly improves the energy efficiency for matrix multiplication workloads by orders of magnitude if scaled and compared to its counterpart architectures.",

For the first time, we also find that LVLMs rely on different pathways depending on the question-answer alignment format. Building on these insights, we propose simple yet effective methods to identify and intervene on critical hallucination heads within each pathway, tailored to discriminative and generative formats.

To bridge this gap, we introduce Task-Preferenced Multi-Demand-Driven Navigation (TP-MDDN), a new benchmark for long-horizon navigation involving multiple sub-demands with explicit task preferences. To solve TP-MDDN, we propose AWMSystem, an autonomous decision-making system composed of three key modules: BreakLLM (instruction decomposition), LocateLLM (goal selection), and StatusMLLM (task monitoring). For spatial memory, we design MASMap, which combines 3D point cloud accumulation with 2D semantic mapping for accurate and efficient environmental understanding. Our Dual-Tempo action generation framework integrates zero-shot planning with policy-based fine control, and is further supported by an Adaptive Error Corrector that handles failure cases in real time. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perception accuracy and navigation robustness.",

To address this, we propose DMG-YOLO, a lightweight real-time detector tailored for small object detection in remote sensing images. Specifically, we design a Dual-branch Feature Extraction (DFE) module in the backbone, which partitions feature maps into two parallel branches: one extracts local features via depthwise separable convolutions, and the other captures global context using a vision transformer with a gating mechanism. Additionally, a Multi-scale Feature Fusion (MFF) module with dilated convolutions enhances multi-scale integration while preserving fine details. In the neck, we introduce the Global and Local Aggregate Feature Pyramid Network (GLAFPN) to further boost small object detection through global-local feature fusion.

Our evaluation covers simple UI interactions (136 tasks) and complex workflows including copy-paste tasks (50 tasks) and enterprise application scenarios (40 tasks), with systematic interface variation coverage, multi-resolution testing and automated validation of task success through the application state. Evaluation of five state-of-the-art models reveals a sharp capability cliff rather than gradual performance degradation. Simple UI interactions achieve 67-85% success rates (compared to 97.9% human performance), but complex workflows drop precipitously to 9-19%. Human evaluators with no prior application experience achieve only 61.2% on complex tasks despite near-perfect performance on simple tasks, establishing realistic performance ceilings. This discontinuous performance pattern -- where agents achieve 68-87% of human performance on simple tasks but only 15-32% on complex workflows -- indicates fundamental architectural limitations in memory management, hierarchical planning, and state coordination rather than incremental capability gaps addressable through better training or prompting. UI-CUBE functions as an enterprise-readiness diagnostic, revealing that while current CUAs can manipulate individual interface elements, they cannot yet function as reliable workflow automation tools. These findings provide architectural insights essential for developing production-ready CUAs capable of managing complex, multi-step enterprise processes.",

Instead, STAR utilizes traversal orders of uniform spanning trees sampled in a lattice defined by the positions of image patches. Traversal orders are obtained through breadth-first search, allowing us to efficiently construct a spanning tree whose traversal order ensures that the connected partial observation of the image appears as a prefix in the sequence through rejection sampling. Through the tailored yet structured randomized strategy compared to random permutation, STAR preserves the capability of postfix completion while maintaining sampling performance without any significant changes to the model architecture widely adopted in the language AR modeling.",

Recent studies attempt to synthesize MRI from Computed Tomography (CT) scans; however, low-dose protocols often result in highly sparse CT volumes with poor through-plane resolution, making accurate reconstruction of the full brain MRI volume particularly challenging. To address this, we propose ReBrain, a retrieval-augmented diffusion framework for brain MRI reconstruction. Given any 3D CT scan with limited slices, we first employ a Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM) to synthesize MRI slices along the 2D dimension. Simultaneously, we retrieve structurally and pathologically similar CT slices from a comprehensive prior database via a fine-tuned retrieval model. These retrieved slices are used as references, incorporated through a ControlNet branch to guide the generation of intermediate MRI slices and ensure structural continuity. We further account for rare retrieval failures when the database lacks suitable references and apply spherical linear interpolation to provide supplementary guidance. Extensive experiments on SynthRAD2023 and BraTS demonstrate that ReBrain achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-modal reconstruction under sparse conditions.",

However, in many instance-level tasks, such as visual grounding and object detection, LVLMs still show performance gaps compared to previous expert models. Meanwhile, although pedestrian tracking is a classical task, there have been a number of new topics in combining object tracking and natural language, such as Referring MOT, Cross-view Referring MOT, and Semantic MOT. These tasks emphasize that models should understand the tracked object at an advanced semantic level, which is exactly where LVLMs excel. In this paper, we propose a new unified Pedestrian Tracking framework, namely OmniPT, which can track, track based on reference and generate semantic understanding of tracked objects interactively. We address two issues: how to model the tracking task into a task that foundation models can perform, and how to make the model output formatted answers. To this end, we implement a training phase consisting of RL-Mid Training-SFT-RL. Based on the pre-trained weights of the LVLM, we first perform a simple RL phase to enable the model to output fixed and supervisable bounding box format. Subsequently, we conduct a mid-training phase using a large number of pedestrian-related datasets. Finally, we perform supervised fine-tuning on several pedestrian tracking datasets, and then carry out another RL phase to improve the model's tracking performance and enhance its ability to follow instructions. We conduct experiments on tracking benchmarks and the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can perform better than the previous methods.",

It is designed to tackle three interconnected tasks: fine-grained ball tracking, articulated racket pose estimation, and predictive ball trajectory forecasting. Our evaluation of established baselines reveals a critical insight for multi-modal fusion: while naively concatenating racket pose features degrades performance, a CrossAttention mechanism is essential to unlock their value, leading to trajectory prediction results that surpass strong unimodal baselines.

In this work, we investigate the use of MedImageInsight, a medical imaging foundational model, for automated binary classification of chest X-rays into Normal and Abnormal categories. Two approaches were evaluated: (1) fine-tuning MedImageInsight for end-to-end classification, and (2) employing the model as a feature extractor for a transfer learning pipeline using traditional machine learning classifiers. Experiments were conducted using a combination of the ChestX-ray14 dataset and real-world clinical data sourced from partner hospitals. The fine-tuned classifier achieved the highest performance, with an ROC-AUC of 0.888 and superior calibration compared to the transfer learning models, demonstrating performance comparable to established architectures such as CheXNet. These results highlight the effectiveness of foundational medical imaging models in reducing task-specific training requirements while maintaining diagnostic reliability. The system is designed for integration into web-based and hospital PACS workflows to support triage and reduce radiologist burden. Future work will extend the model to multi-label pathology classification to provide preliminary diagnostic interpretation in clinical environments.",

Existing approaches typically rely on heterogeneous information networks or knowledge graphs to capture conceptual relationships, combined with knowledge tracing models to assess learners' cognitive states. However, these methods face significant limitations due to their dependence on high-quality structured knowledge graphs, which are often scarce in real-world educational scenarios. To address this fundamental challenge, this paper proposes CLLMRec, a novel framework that leverages Large Language Models through two synergistic technical pillars: Semantic Alignment and Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation. The Semantic Alignment component constructs a unified representation space by encoding unstructured textual descriptions of learners and concepts. The Prerequisite Knowledge Distillation paradigm employs a teacher-student architecture, where a large teacher LLM (implemented as the Prior Knowledge Aware Component) extracts conceptual prerequisite relationships from its internalized world knowledge and distills them into soft labels to train an efficient student ranker. Building upon these foundations, our framework incorporates a fine-ranking mechanism that explicitly models learners' real-time cognitive states through deep knowledge tracing, ensuring recommendations are both structurally sound and cognitively appropriate. Extensive experiments on two real-world MOOC datasets demonstrate that CLLMRec significantly outperforms existing baseline methods across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in generating truly cognitive-aware and personalized concept recommendations without relying on explicit structural priors.",

Existing pipelines often rely on camera parameters (e.g., focal length, focus distance, aperture size) and scene depth to compute the circle of confusion (CoC) for realistic lens blur rendering. However, such information is often unavailable to ordinary users, limiting the accessibility and generalizability of these methods. In this work, we propose a novel compositing approach that directly estimates the CoC map from RGB images, bypassing the need for scene depth or camera metadata. The CoC values for virtual objects are inferred through a linear relationship between its signed CoC map and depth, and realistic lens blur is rendered using a neural reblurring network. Our method provides flexible and practical solution for real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves high-fidelity compositing with realistic defocus effects, outperforming state-of-the-art techniques in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.",

Despite impressive progress with vision-language models like CLIP, existing methods still fall into the dilemma between structural risk of known-classes and open-space risk from unknown-classes, and easily suffers from over-confidence, especially when distinguishing ``hard unknowns\" that share fine-grained visual similarities with known classes. To this end, we propose a Semantic-enhanced CLIP (SeeCLIP) framework that explicitly addresses this dilemma through fine-grained semantic enhancement. In SeeCLIP, we propose a semantic-aware prompt enhancement module to decompose images into discriminative semantic tokens, enabling nuanced vision-language alignment beyond coarse category labels. To position unknown prompts effectively, we introduce duplex contrastive learning with complementary objectives, that is, repulsion to maintain separability from known classes, and cohesion to preserve semantic proximity. Further, our semantic-guided diffusion module synthesizes pseudo-unknowns by perturbing extracted semantic tokens, generating challenging samples that are visually similar to known classes yet exhibit key local differences. These hard negatives force the model to learn finer decision boundaries.

Specifically, RASTP evaluates token importance by combining semantic saliency, measured via representation magnitude, and attention centrality, derived from cumulative attention weights. Since RASTP dynamically prunes low-information or irrelevant semantic tokens, experiments on three real-world Amazon datasets show that RASTP reduces training time by 26.7\\%, while maintaining or slightly improving recommendation performance.

In the midst of both excitement and skepticism, it is crucial to take stock of how GenAI is actually being used. Our study focuses on sociological research as our site, and here we present findings from a survey of 433 authors of articles published in 50 sociology journals in the last five years. The survey provides an overview of the state of the discipline with regard to the use of GenAI by providing answers to fundamental questions: how (much) do scholars use the technology for their research; what are their reasons for using it; and how concerned, trustful, and optimistic are they about the technology? Of the approximately one third ofrespondents who self-report using GenAI at least weekly, the primary uses are for writing assistance and comparatively less so in planning, data collection, or data analysis. In both use and attitudes, there are surprisingly few differences between self-identified computational and non-computational researchers. Generally, respondents are very concerned about the social and environmental consequences of GenAI. Trust in GenAI outputs is low, regardless of expertise or frequency of use.

        "summary": "High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many clinical and research applications. However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address. Additionally, we provide a collection of essential open-access resources, tools, and tutorials, available on our GitHub: https://github.com/mkhateri/Awesome-MRI-Super-Resolution.

Our approach transforms natural language descriptions into traversable, fully textured environments that can be immediately explored or edited within standard game engines. By combining LLM-driven scene layout reasoning, procedural generation, diffusion-based 3D generation, and object-aware scene decomposition, WorldGen bridges the gap between creative intent and functional virtual spaces, allowing creators to design coherent, navigable worlds without manual modeling or specialized 3D expertise. The system is fully modular and supports fine-grained control over layout, scale, and style, producing worlds that are geometrically consistent, visually rich, and efficient to render in real time.

        "summary": "3D meshes are a critical building block for applications ranging from industrial design and gaming to simulation and robotics. Traditionally, meshes are crafted manually by artists, a process that is time-intensive and difficult to scale. To automate and accelerate this asset creation, autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for artistic mesh generation. However, current methods to enhance quality typically rely on larger models or longer sequences that result in longer generation time, and their inherent sequential nature imposes a severe quality-speed trade-off. This sequential dependency also significantly complicates incremental editing. To overcome these limitations, we propose Mesh RAG, a novel, training-free, plug-and-play framework for autoregressive mesh generation models. Inspired by RAG for language models, our approach augments the generation process by leveraging point cloud segmentation, spatial transformation, and point cloud registration to retrieve, generate, and integrate mesh components. This retrieval-based approach decouples generation from its strict sequential dependency, facilitating efficient and parallelizable inference. We demonstrate the wide applicability of Mesh RAG across various foundational autoregressive mesh generation models, showing it significantly enhances mesh quality, accelerates generation speed compared to sequential part prediction, and enables incremental editing, all without model retraining.",

We formalize the computational correspondence between AR and GAR, survey the technical foundations that make real-time generative augmentation feasible, and outline prospective applications that leverage its unified inference model. We envision GAR as a future AR paradigm that delivers high-fidelity experiences in terms of realism, interactivity, and immersion, while eliciting new research challenges on technologies, content ecosystems, and the ethical and societal implications.",

        "summary": "Audio-language pretraining holds promise for general-purpose audio understanding, yet remains underexplored compared to its vision counterpart. While vision-language models like CLIP serve as widely adopted foundations, existing audio-language models primarily excel at retrieval tasks with limited adoption as general-purpose encoders. We identify three key barriers: limited large-scale audio-text corpora, insufficient caption diversity, and lack of systematic exploration and evaluation. To this end, we introduce CaptionStew, a 10.7M caption dataset aggregating diverse open-source audio-text corpora across multiple domains and captioning styles. Using this resource, we conduct the first comprehensive evaluation comparing contrastive and captioning objectives for audio representation learning across speech, music, and environmental sound tasks. Our results demonstrate that audio-language pretraining yields competitive, transferable representations. Through systematic data-scaling experiments, we reveal complementary objective strengths: contrastive learning achieves superior data efficiency at smaller scales, while captioning demonstrates better scalability on language-involved audio understanding tasks. We also find that common supervised initialization practices provide diminishing returns at scale, challenging current approaches. These findings establish audio-language pretraining as a viable pathway toward general-purpose audio representations, guiding future research. To accelerate progress, we release data preparation recipes, training protocols, and pretrained models, paving the way toward universal audio understanding.",

Promptable Concept Segmentation (PCS) takes such prompts and returns segmentation masks and unique identities for all matching object instances. To advance PCS, we build a scalable data engine that produces a high-quality dataset with 4M unique concept labels, including hard negatives, across images and videos. Our model consists of an image-level detector and a memory-based video tracker that share a single backbone. Recognition and localization are decoupled with a presence head, which boosts detection accuracy. SAM 3 doubles the accuracy of existing systems in both image and video PCS, and improves previous SAM capabilities on visual segmentation tasks. We open source SAM 3 along with our new Segment Anything with Concepts (SA-Co) benchmark for promptable concept segmentation.",

        "summary": "Neutron imaging is important in optimizing analysis of inertial confinement fusion (ICF) events such as those at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) and improving current and future ICF platforms. However, images of neutron sources are often degraded by various types of noise. Most commonly, Gaussian and Poisson noise often coexist within one image, obscuring fine details and blurring edges. These noise types often overlap, making them difficult to distinguish and remove using conventional filtering and thresholding methods. As a result, noise removal techniques that preserve image fidelity are important for analyzing and interpreting images of a neutron source. Current solutions include a combination of filtering and thresholding methodologies. In the past, machine learning approaches were rarely implemented due to a lack of ground truth neutron imaging data for ICF processes. However, recent advances in synthetic data production, particularly in the fusion imaging field, have opened opportunities to investigate new denoising procedures using both supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. In this study, we implement an unsupervised autoencoder with a Cohen-Daubechies- Feauveau (CDF 97) wavelet transform in the latent space for mixed Gaussian-Poisson denoising. The network successfully denoises neutron imaging data. Additionally, it demonstrates lower reconstruction error and superior edge preservation metrics when benchmarked with data generated by a forward model and compared to non-ML-based filtering mechanisms such as Block-matching and 3D filtering (BM3D). This approach presents a promising advancement in neutron image noise reduction and three-dimensional reconstruction analysis of ICF experiments.",

        "summary": "Backdoor attacks pose a serious threat to the secure deployment of large language models (LLMs), enabling adversaries to implant hidden behaviors triggered by specific inputs. However, existing methods often rely on manually crafted triggers and static data pipelines, which are rigid, labor-intensive, and inadequate for systematically evaluating modern defense robustness. As AI agents become increasingly capable, there is a growing need for more rigorous, diverse, and scalable \\textit{red-teaming frameworks} that can realistically simulate backdoor threats and assess model resilience under adversarial conditions. In this work, we introduce \\textsc{AutoBackdoor}, a general framework for automating backdoor injection, encompassing trigger generation, poisoned data construction, and model fine-tuning via an autonomous agent-driven pipeline. Unlike prior approaches, AutoBackdoor uses a powerful language model agent to generate semantically coherent, context-aware trigger phrases, enabling scalable poisoning across arbitrary topics with minimal human effort. We evaluate AutoBackdoor under three realistic threat scenarios, including \\textit{Bias Recommendation}, \\textit{Hallucination Injection}, and \\textit{Peer Review Manipulation}, to simulate a broad range of attacks. Experiments on both open-source and commercial models, including LLaMA-3, Mistral, Qwen, and GPT-4o, demonstrate that our method achieves over 90\\% attack success with only a small number of poisoned samples. More importantly, we find that existing defenses often fail to mitigate these attacks, underscoring the need for more rigorous and adaptive evaluation techniques against agent-driven threats as explored in this work.

The generated instances encompass various configurations, reflecting real-world scenarios and operational constraints. These instances facilitate comprehensive benchmarking and evaluation of scheduling algorithms, particularly in contexts of energy efficiency.
