        "summary": "With the rapid development of (multimodal) large language model-based agents, the landscape of agentic service management has evolved from single-agent systems to multi-agent systems, and now to massive-agent ecosystems. Current massive-agent ecosystems face growing challenges, including impersonal service experiences, a lack of standardization, and untrustworthy behavior. To address these issues, we propose ColorEcosystem, a novel blueprint designed to enable personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service at scale. Concretely, ColorEcosystem consists of three key components: agent carrier, agent store, and agent audit. The agent carrier provides personalized service experiences by utilizing user-specific data and creating a digital twin, while the agent store serves as a centralized, standardized platform for managing diverse agentic services. The agent audit, based on the supervision of developer and user activities, ensures the integrity and credibility of both service providers and users. Through the analysis of challenges, transitional forms, and practical considerations, the ColorEcosystem is poised to power personalized, standardized, and trustworthy agentic service across massive-agent ecosystems. Meanwhile, we have also implemented part of ColorEcosystem's functionality, and the relevant code is open-sourced at https://github.com/opas-lab/color-ecosystem.",

Agentic systems have recently emerged as a promising tool to automate literature-based ideation. However, current systems often remain black-box. Their outputs may appear plausible but weakly grounded, with limited transparency or control for researchers. Our work introduces \\textsc{autoresearcher}, a multi-agent demo system for knowledge-grounded and transparent ideation. Specifically, \\textsc{autoresearcher} integrates meticulously designed four stages into a unified framework: (A) Structured Knowledge Curation, (B) Diversified Idea Generation, (C) Multi-stage Idea Selection, and (D) Expert Panel Review \\& Synthesis. Different from prior pipelines, our system not only exposes intermediate reasoning states, execution logs, and tunable agents for inspections, but also enables the generation of hypotheses that are both diverse and evidence-aligned. Our design is also domain-agnostic: as long as literature sources exist, the same pipeline can be instantiated in any scientific field. As an illustrative case, we demonstrate \\textsc{autoresearcher} on a graph-mining case study ($k$-truss breaking problem), where it generates distinct, plausible hypotheses with evidence and critiques.

        "summary": "Designing incentives for a multi-agent system to induce a desirable Nash equilibrium is both a crucial and challenging problem appearing in many decision-making domains, especially for a large number of agents $N$. Under the exchangeability assumption, we formalize this incentive design (ID) problem as a parameterized mean-field game (PMFG), aiming to reduce complexity via an infinite-population limit. We first show that when dynamics and rewards are Lipschitz, the finite-$N$ ID objective is approximated by the PMFG at rate $\\mathscr{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$. Moreover, beyond the Lipschitz-continuous setting, we prove the same $\\mathscr{O}(\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}})$ decay for the important special case of sequential auctions, despite discontinuities in dynamics, through a tailored auction-specific analysis. Built on our novel approximation results, we further introduce our Adjoint Mean-Field Incentive Design (AMID) algorithm, which uses explicit differentiation of iterated equilibrium operators to compute gradients efficiently. By uniting approximation bounds with optimization guarantees, AMID delivers a powerful, scalable algorithmic tool for many-agent (large $N$) ID. Across diverse auction settings, the proposed AMID method substantially increases revenue over first-price formats and outperforms existing benchmark methods.",

        "summary": "Chest X-ray (CXR) plays a pivotal role in clinical diagnosis, and a variety of task-specific and foundation models have been developed for automatic CXR interpretation. However, these models often struggle to adapt to new diagnostic tasks and complex reasoning scenarios. Recently, LLM-based agent models have emerged as a promising paradigm for CXR analysis, enhancing model's capability through tool coordination, multi-step reasoning, and team collaboration, etc. However, existing agents often rely on a single diagnostic pipeline and lack mechanisms for assessing tools' reliability, limiting their adaptability and credibility. To this end, we propose CXRAgent, a director-orchestrated, multi-stage agent for CXR interpretation, where a central director coordinates the following stages: (1) Tool Invocation: The agent strategically orchestrates a set of CXR-analysis tools, with outputs normalized and verified by the Evidence-driven Validator (EDV), which grounds diagnostic outputs with visual evidence to support reliable downstream diagnosis; (2) Diagnostic Planning: Guided by task requirements and intermediate findings, the agent formulates a targeted diagnostic plan. It then assembles an expert team accordingly, defining member roles and coordinating their interactions to enable adaptive and collaborative reasoning; (3) Collaborative Decision-making: The agent integrates insights from the expert team with accumulated contextual memories, synthesizing them into an evidence-backed diagnostic conclusion. Experiments on various CXR interpretation tasks show that CXRAgent delivers strong performance, providing visual evidence and generalizes well to clinical tasks of different complexity.

        "summary": "In shift bribery, a briber seeks to promote his preferred candidate by paying voters to raise their ranking. Classical models of shift bribery assume voters act independently, overlooking the role of social influence. However, in reality, individuals are social beings and are often represented as part of a social network, where bribed voters may influence their neighbors, thereby amplifying the effect of persuasion. We study Shift bribery over Networks, where voters are modeled as nodes in a directed weighted graph, and arcs represent social influence between them. In this setting, bribery is not confined to directly targeted voters its effects can propagate through the network, influencing neighbors and amplifying persuasion. Given a budget and individual cost functions for shifting each voter's preference toward a designated candidate, the goal is to determine whether a shift strategy exists within budget that ensures the preferred candidate wins after both direct and network-propagated influence takes effect. We show that the problem is NP-Complete even with two candidates and unit costs, and W[2]-hard when parameterized by budget or maximum degree. On the positive side, we design polynomial-time algorithms for complete graphs under plurality and majority rules and path graphs for uniform edge weights, linear-time algorithms for transitive tournaments for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights, and pseudo-polynomial algorithms for cluster graphs. We further prove the existence of fixed-parameter tractable algorithms with treewidth as parameter for two candidates, linear cost functions and uniform arc weights and pseudo-FPT with cluster vertex deletion number for two candidates and uniform arc weights. Together, these results give a detailed complexity landscape for shift bribery in social networks.",

The model considers firms, banks, and households interacting on labour, goods, credit, and interbank markets. Households move their liquidity from deposits to CBDC based on the perceived riskiness of their banks. We find that the introduction of CBDC exacerbates bank-runs and may lead to financial instability phenomena. The effect can be changed by introducing a limit on CBDC holdings. The adoption of CBDC has little effect on macroeconomic variables but the interest rate on loans to firms goes up and credit goes down in a limited way. CBDC leads to a redistribution of wealth from firms and banks to households with a higher bank default rate. CBDC may have negative welfare effects, but a bound on holding enables a welfare improvement.",

Initially, sketches are iteratively refined into a structured JSON layout of walls, doors, and windows. Later, these layouts are transformed into executable scripts that generate 3D BIM models. Experiments on ten diverse floor plans demonstrate strong convergence: openings (doors, windows) are captured with high reliability in the initial pass, while wall detection begins around 83% and achieves near-perfect alignment after a few feedback iterations. Across all categories, precision, recall, and F1 scores remain above 0.83, and geometric errors (RMSE, MAE) progressively decrease to zero through feedback corrections. This study demonstrates how MLLM-driven multi-agent reasoning can make BIM creation accessible to both experts and non-experts using only freehand sketches.",

Existing accounts, from classical logic to probabilistic models, illuminate aspects of output or individual modelling, but do not offer a unified, quantitative description of general human reasoning dynamics. To solve this, we introduce Information Flow Tracking (IF-Track), that uses large language models (LLMs) as probabilistic encoder to quantify information entropy and gain at each reasoning step. Through fine-grained analyses across diverse tasks, our method is the first successfully models the universal landscape of human reasoning behaviors within a single metric space. We show that IF-Track captures essential reasoning features, identifies systematic error patterns, and characterizes individual differences. Applied to discussion of advanced psychological theory, we first reconcile single- versus dual-process theories in IF-Track and discover the alignment of artificial and human cognition and how LLMs reshaping human reasoning process. This approach establishes a quantitative bridge between theory and measurement, offering mechanistic insights into the architecture of reasoning.",

        "summary": "Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated outstanding reasoning capabilities on mathematical and coding tasks. However, their application to financial tasks-especially the most fundamental task of stock movement prediction-remains underexplored. We study a three-class classification problem (up, hold, down) and, by analyzing existing reasoning responses, observe that: (1) LLMs follow analysts' opinions rather than exhibit a systematic, independent analytical logic (CoTs). (2) LLMs list summaries from different sources without weighing adversarial evidence, yet such counterevidence is crucial for reliable prediction. It shows that the model does not make good use of its reasoning ability to complete the task. To address this, we propose Reflective Evidence Tuning (RETuning), a cold-start method prior to reinforcement learning, to enhance prediction ability. While generating CoT, RETuning encourages dynamically constructing an analytical framework from diverse information sources, organizing and scoring evidence for price up or down based on that framework-rather than on contextual viewpoints-and finally reflecting to derive the prediction. This approach maximally aligns the model with its learned analytical framework, ensuring independent logical reasoning and reducing undue influence from context. We also build a large-scale dataset spanning all of 2024 for 5,123 A-share stocks, with long contexts (32K tokens) and over 200K samples. In addition to price and news, it incorporates analysts' opinions, quantitative reports, fundamental data, macroeconomic indicators, and similar stocks. Experiments show that RETuning successfully unlocks the model's reasoning ability in the financial domain. Inference-time scaling still works even after 6 months or on out-of-distribution stocks, since the models gain valuable insights about stock movement prediction.",

To contribute to this line of research, we introduce SloPragEval and SloPragMega, the first pragmatics understanding benchmarks for Slovene that contain altogether 405 multiple-choice questions. We discuss the difficulties of translation, describe the campaign to establish a human baseline, and report pilot evaluations with LLMs. Our results indicate that current models have greatly improved in understanding nuanced language but may still fail to infer implied speaker meaning in non-literal utterances, especially those that are culture-specific. We also observe a significant gap between proprietary and open-source models.

To address this, we explore a mechanistic detection approach based on external context scores and parametric knowledge scores. Using Qwen3-0.6b, we compute these scores across layers and attention heads and train regression-based classifiers to predict hallucinations. Our method is evaluated against state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT-5, GPT-4.1) and detection baselines (RAGAS, TruLens, RefChecker). Furthermore, classifiers trained on Qwen3-0.6b signals generalize to GPT-4.1-mini responses, demonstrating the potential of proxy-model evaluation.

        "summary": "Pretrained language models are remarkably effective in aligning with human brain responses elicited by natural language stimuli, positioning them as promising model organisms for studying language processing in the brain. However, existing approaches for both estimating and improving this brain alignment are participant-dependent and highly affected by the amount of data available per participant, hindering both generalization to new participants and population-level analyses. In this work, we address these limitations by introducing a scalable, generalizable brain-tuning method, in which we fine-tune pretrained speech language models to jointly predict fMRI responses from multiple participants. We demonstrate that the resulting brain-tuned models exhibit strong individual brain alignment while generalizing across participants. Specifically, our method leads to 1) a 5-fold decrease in the amount of fMRI data needed to predict brain data from new participants, 2) up to a 50% increase in the overall brain alignment, and 3) strong generalization to new unseen datasets. Furthermore, this multi-participant brain-tuning additionally improves downstream performance on semantic tasks, suggesting that training using brain data from multiple participants leads to more generalizable semantic representations. Taken together, these findings demonstrate a bidirectional benefit between neuroscience and AI, helping bridge the gap between the two fields.

        "summary": "Recent advances in diffusion language models (DLMs) have presented a promising alternative to traditional autoregressive large language models (LLMs). However, DLMs still lag behind LLMs in reasoning performance, especially as the number of denoising steps decreases. Our analysis reveals that this shortcoming arises primarily from the independent generation of masked tokens across denoising steps, which fails to capture the token correlation. In this paper, we define two types of token correlation: intra-sequence correlation and inter-sequence correlation, and demonstrate that enhancing these correlations improves reasoning performance. To this end, we propose a Multi-Reward Optimization (MRO) approach, which encourages DLMs to consider the token correlation during the denoising process. More specifically, our MRO approach leverages test-time scaling, reject sampling, and reinforcement learning to directly optimize the token correlation with multiple elaborate rewards. Additionally, we introduce group step and importance sampling strategies to mitigate reward variance and enhance sampling efficiency. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that MRO not only improves reasoning performance but also achieves significant sampling speedups while maintaining high performance on reasoning benchmarks.",

        "summary": "With the widespread adoption of wearable devices in our daily lives, the demand and appeal for remote patient monitoring have significantly increased. Most research in this field has concentrated on collecting sensor data, visualizing it, and analyzing it to detect anomalies in specific diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and depression. However, this domain has a notable gap in the aspect of human-machine interaction. This paper proposes REMONI, an autonomous REmote health MONItoring system that integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs), the Internet of Things (IoT), and wearable devices. The system automatically and continuously collects vital signs, accelerometer data from a special wearable (such as a smartwatch), and visual data in patient video clips collected from cameras. This data is processed by an anomaly detection module, which includes a fall detection model and algorithms to identify and alert caregivers of the patient's emergency conditions. A distinctive feature of our proposed system is the natural language processing component, developed with MLLMs capable of detecting and recognizing a patient's activity and emotion while responding to healthcare worker's inquiries. Additionally, prompt engineering is employed to integrate all patient information seamlessly. As a result, doctors and nurses can access real-time vital signs and the patient's current state and mood by interacting with an intelligent agent through a user-friendly web application. Our experiments demonstrate that our system is implementable and scalable for real-life scenarios, potentially reducing the workload of medical professionals and healthcare costs. A full-fledged prototype illustrating the functionalities of the system has been developed and being tested to demonstrate the robustness of its various capabilities.",

        "summary": "Traditional Information Retrieval (IR) metrics, such as nDCG, MAP, and MRR, assume that human users sequentially examine documents with diminishing attention to lower ranks. This assumption breaks down in Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, where search results are consumed by Large Language Models (LLMs), which, unlike humans, process all retrieved documents as a whole rather than sequentially. Additionally, traditional IR metrics do not account for related but irrelevant documents that actively degrade generation quality, rather than merely being ignored. Due to these two major misalignments, namely human vs. machine position discount and human relevance vs. machine utility, classical IR metrics do not accurately predict RAG performance. We introduce a utility-based annotation schema that quantifies both the positive contribution of relevant passages and the negative impact of distracting ones. Building on this foundation, we propose UDCG (Utility and Distraction-aware Cumulative Gain), a metric using an LLM-oriented positional discount to directly optimize the correlation with the end-to-end answer accuracy. Experiments on five datasets and six LLMs demonstrate that UDCG improves correlation by up to 36% compared to traditional metrics. Our work provides a critical step toward aligning IR evaluation with LLM consumers and enables more reliable assessment of RAG components",

One area that remains relatively underexplored is their use in human activity recognition (HAR) for remote health monitoring. VLMs offer notable strengths, including greater flexibility and the ability to overcome some of the constraints of traditional deep learning models. However, a key challenge in applying VLMs to HAR lies in the difficulty of evaluating their dynamic and often non-deterministic outputs. To address this gap, we introduce a descriptive caption data set and propose comprehensive evaluation methods to evaluate VLMs in HAR. Through comparative experiments with state-of-the-art deep learning models, our findings demonstrate that VLMs achieve comparable performance and, in some cases, even surpass conventional approaches in terms of accuracy. This work contributes a strong benchmark and opens new possibilities for the integration of VLMs into intelligent healthcare systems.",

Trained from scratch on 312 GB of Turkish text (mC4, OSCAR23, Wikipedia), SindBERT is released in both base and large configurations, representing the first large-scale encoder-only language model available for Turkish. We evaluate SindBERT on part-of-speech tagging, named entity recognition, offensive language detection, and the TurBLiMP linguistic acceptability benchmark. Our results show that SindBERT performs competitively with existing Turkish and multilingual models, with the large variant achieving the best scores in two of four tasks but showing no consistent scaling advantage overall. This flat scaling trend, also observed for XLM-R and EuroBERT, suggests that current Turkish benchmarks may already be saturated. At the same time, comparisons with smaller but more curated models such as BERTurk highlight that corpus quality and diversity can outweigh sheer data volume. Taken together, SindBERT contributes both as an openly released resource for Turkish NLP and as an empirical case study on the limits of scaling and the central role of corpus composition in morphologically rich languages.

Our annotators drew inspiration from a popular radio program featuring public figures from culture and media, as well as major sports events in Sweden. The dataset can be used to measure factual recall across models of varying sizes and degrees of Swedish coverage, and allows to probe cross-lingual factual consistency as to contains English translations. Using the dataset, we find that smaller models with stronger Swedish coverage perform comparably to a three times larger multilingual model in recalling Sweden-related facts. We also observe that continued pre-training on Swedish generally improves factual knowledge but also leads to forgetting of a part of the previously known information. These results demonstrate the dataset's potential as a diagnostic tool for studying language adaptation and knowledge retention in multilingual models and during language adaptation.",

In this work, we study whether multi-turn training with human feedback is necessary for reasoning tasks. We compare conventional single-turn training with three multi-turn strategies and reach contrary conclusions to previous research. We find that models trained in a single-turn setting generalize effectively to both single- and multi-turn evaluations, while models trained with multi-turn strategies exhibit a significant degradation in single-turn reasoning performance. These results suggest that for tasks with complete information, robust single-turn training remains more effective and reliable, as multi-turn training with basic feedback provides limited benefits and can even degrade reasoning capabilities.",

TripTide models key dimensions such as disruption severity and traveler tolerance, enabling nuanced assessment of LLM adaptability to events like flight cancellations, weather closures, or overbooked attractions. We conduct a threefold evaluation. First, we introduce automatic metrics including Preservation of Intent (how well the revised plan maintains feasibility and goals), Responsiveness (promptness and appropriateness of disruption handling), and Adaptability (semantic, spatial, and sequential divergence between original and revised plans). Second, we apply an LLM-as-a-judge approach to automatically assess revision quality. Third, we perform manual expert evaluation to verify whether revisions preserve semantic, spatial, sequential, and responsive aspects. Our experiments show that LLMs maintain strong sequential consistency and semantic stability, while spatial deviations are larger for shorter trips but decrease with longer ones, indicating that extended plans encourage better geographic coherence. However, disruption-handling ability declines as plan length increases, highlighting limits in LLM robustness. TripTide establishes a benchmark for evaluating adaptability, personalization, and resilience in LLM-based travel planning under real-world uncertainty.",

Some specific NLP models have recently been proposed that similarly demonstrate robustness to such distortions by ignoring the internal order of characters by design. This raises a fundamental question: how can models perform well when many distinct words (e.g., form and from) collapse into identical representations under typoglycemia? Our work, focusing exclusively on the English language, seeks to shed light on the underlying aspects responsible for this robustness. We hypothesize that the main reasons have to do with the fact that (i) relatively few English words collapse under typoglycemia, and that (ii) collapsed words tend to occur in contexts so distinct that disambiguation becomes trivial. In our analysis, we (i) analyze the British National Corpus to quantify word collapse and ambiguity under typoglycemia, (ii) evaluate BERT's ability to disambiguate collapsing forms, and (iii) conduct a probing experiment by comparing variants of BERT trained from scratch on clean versus typoglycemic Wikipedia text; our results reveal that the performance degradation caused by scrambling is smaller than expected.",

We introduce a diversity-steered sampler that discourages semantically redundant outputs during decoding, covers both autoregressive and masked diffusion paradigms, and yields substantial sample-efficiency gains. The key idea is to inject a continuous semantic-similarity penalty into the model's proposal distribution using a natural language inference (NLI) model lightly finetuned on partial prefixes or intermediate diffusion states. We debias downstream uncertainty estimates with importance reweighting and shrink their variance with control variates. Across four QA benchmarks, our method matches or surpasses baselines while covering more semantic clusters with the same number of samples. Being modular and requiring no gradient access to the base LLM, the framework promises to serve as a drop-in enhancement for uncertainty estimation in risk-sensitive model deployments.",

While prior work focused on representing tasks that rely on a language representation, we study structured, non-linguistic reasoning - such as interpreting positions in a grid world. We therefore introduce PARL (Prompt-based Agent for Reinforcement Learning), a method that uses LLMs as RL agents through prompting, without any fine-tuning. PARL encodes actions, states, and rewards in the prompt, enabling the model to learn through trial-and-error interaction. We evaluate PARL on three standard RL tasks that do not entirely rely on natural language. We show that it can match or outperform traditional RL agents in simple environments by leveraging pretrained knowledge.

        "summary": "Scaling the context length of large language models (LLMs) offers significant benefits but is computationally expensive. This expense stems primarily from the self-attention mechanism, whose $O(N^2)$ complexity with respect to sequence length presents a major bottleneck for both memory and latency. Fortunately, the attention matrix is often sparse, particularly for long sequences, suggesting an opportunity for optimization. Block-sparse attention has emerged as a promising solution that partitions sequences into blocks and skips computation for a subset of these blocks. However, the effectiveness of this method is highly dependent on the underlying attention patterns, which can lead to sub-optimal block-level sparsity. For instance, important key tokens for queries within a single block may be scattered across numerous other blocks, leading to computational redundancy. In this work, we propose Permuted Block-Sparse Attention (\\textbf{PBS-Attn}), a plug-and-play method that leverages the permutation properties of attention to increase block-level sparsity and enhance the computational efficiency of LLM prefilling. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging real-world long-context datasets, demonstrating that PBS-Attn consistently outperforms existing block-sparse attention methods in model accuracy and closely matches the full attention baseline. Powered by our custom permuted-FlashAttention kernels, PBS-Attn achieves an end-to-end speedup of up to $2.75\\times$ in long-context prefilling, confirming its practical viability.

We introduce correlation dimension, a fractal-geometric measure of self-similarity, to quantify the epistemological complexity of text as perceived by a language model. This measure captures the hierarchical recurrence structure of language, bridging local and global properties in a unified framework.

Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) offer opportunities to augment dispatchers. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a taxonomy-grounded, LLM-powered multi-agent system for simulating realistic EMD scenarios. Methods: We constructed a clinical taxonomy (32 chief complaints, 6 caller identities from MIMIC-III) and a six-phase call protocol. Using this framework, we developed an AutoGen-based MAS with Caller and Dispatcher Agents. The system grounds interactions in a fact commons to ensure clinical plausibility and mitigate misinformation. We used a hybrid evaluation framework: four physicians assessed 100 simulated cases for \"Guidance Efficacy\" and \"Dispatch Effectiveness,\" supplemented by automated linguistic analysis (sentiment, readability, politeness). Results: Human evaluation, with substantial inter-rater agreement (Gwe's AC1 > 0.70), confirmed the system's high performance. It demonstrated excellent Dispatch Effectiveness (e.g., 94 % contacting the correct potential other agents) and Guidance Efficacy (advice provided in 91 % of cases), both rated highly by physicians. Algorithmic metrics corroborated these findings, indicating a predominantly neutral affective profile (73.7 % neutral sentiment; 90.4 % neutral emotion), high readability (Flesch 80.9), and a consistently polite style (60.0 % polite; 0 % impolite). Conclusion: Our taxonomy-grounded MAS simulates diverse, clinically plausible dispatch scenarios with high fidelity. Findings support its use for dispatcher training, protocol evaluation, and as a foundation for real-time decision support.

Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in emulating human behaviors, interactions, and decision-making, offering a powerful new lens for social science studies. However, the extent to which LLMs diverge from authentic human behavior in social contexts remains underexplored, posing risks of misinterpretation in scientific studies and unintended consequences in real-world applications. Here, we introduce a systematic framework for analyzing LLMs' behavior in social simulation. Our approach simulates multi-agent interactions through chatroom-style conversations and analyzes them across five linguistic dimensions, providing a simple yet effective method to examine emergent social cognitive biases. We conduct extensive experiments involving eight representative LLMs across three families. Our findings reveal that LLMs do not faithfully reproduce genuine human behavior but instead reflect overly idealized versions of it, shaped by the social desirability bias. In particular, LLMs show social role bias, primacy effect, and positivity bias, resulting in \"Utopian\" societies that lack the complexity and variability of real human interactions. These findings call for more socially grounded LLMs that capture the diversity of human social behavior.",

Recent research shows that combining LLMs and TAGs yields complementary benefits: enhancing TAG representation learning and improving the reasoning and interpretability of LLMs. This survey provides the first systematic review of LLM--TAG integration from an orchestration perspective. We introduce a novel taxonomy covering two fundamental directions: LLM for TAG, where LLMs enrich graph-based tasks, and TAG for LLM, where structured graphs improve LLM reasoning. We categorize orchestration strategies into sequential, parallel, and multi-module frameworks, and discuss advances in TAG-specific pretraining, prompting, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning.

For instance, common sense is often incorporated into responses and labeled as \"faithful\", yet the acceptable extent of such knowledge remains unspecified, leading to inconsistent annotations. To address this issue, we propose a novel faithfulness annotation framework, which introduces an intermediate category, Out-Dependent, to classify cases where external knowledge is required for verification. Using this framework, we construct VeriGray (Verification with the Gray Zone) -- a new unfaithfulness detection benchmark in summarization. Statistics reveal that even SOTA LLMs, such as GPT-5, exhibit hallucinations ($\\sim 6\\%$ of sentences) in summarization tasks. Moreover, a substantial proportion ($\\sim 8\\%$ on average of models) of generated sentences fall into the Out-Dependent category, underscoring the importance of resolving annotation ambiguity in unfaithfulness detection benchmarks.

        "summary": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) has emerged as a crucial method for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human-annotated demonstrations. However, SFT, being an off-policy approach similar to behavior cloning, often struggles with overfitting and poor out-of-domain generalization, especially in limited-data scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Rewarding PPO, a novel fine-tuning method that leverages on-policy techniques to enhance generalization performance. Our approach combines the strengths of SFT and proximal policy optimization (PPO) to achieve more effective alignment from demonstration data. At its core is a reward function designed as the log policy ratio between the SFT model and the pretrained base model. This function serves as an implicit reward signal, using the pretrained policy as a baseline and the SFT policy as a target. By doing so, it enables on-policy fine-tuning without relying on human preference annotations. The integration of this self-rewarding mechanism with PPO addresses key limitations of SFT, improving generalization, data efficiency, and robustness. Our empirical evaluation across a range of natural language processing tasks demonstrates that Self-Rewarding PPO consistently outperforms traditional SFT methods. The results highlight the effectiveness of our approach in aligning LLMs using demonstration data, particularly in scenarios where high-quality annotated data is scarce.",

By leveraging large-scale patient data, drug recommendation systems can assist physicians in selecting the most appropriate medications according to a patient's medical history, diagnoses, laboratory results, and comorbidities. However, the advancement of such systems is significantly hampered by the scarcity of publicly available, real-world EHR datasets, particularly in languages other than English. In this work, we present CDrugRed, a first publicly available Chinese drug recommendation dataset focused on discharge medications for metabolic diseases. The dataset includes 5,894 de-identified records from 3,190 patients, containing comprehensive information such as patient demographics, medical history, clinical course, and discharge diagnoses. We assess the utility of CDrugRed by benchmarking several state-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) on the discharge medication recommendation task. Experimental results show that while supervised fine-tuning improves model performance, there remains substantial room for improvement, with the best model achieving the F1 score of 0.5648 and Jaccard score of 0.4477. This result highlights the complexity of the clinical drug recommendation task and establishes CDrugRed as a challenging and valuable resource for developing more robust and accurate drug recommendation systems.

To address this gap we made an effort of bridging language gaps by incorporating Adaptive RAG system to Indonesian language.

To overcome the limited availability of Indonesian language dataset, our study employs machine translation as data augmentation approach.

We address these issues by dynamically selecting supporting demonstrations according to their utility for the edit. We propose Dynamic Retriever for In-Context Knowledge Editing (DR-IKE), a lightweight framework that (1) trains a BERT retriever with REINFORCE to rank demonstrations by editing reward, and (2) employs a learnable threshold to prune low-value examples, shortening the prompt when the edit is easy and expanding it when the task is hard. DR-IKE performs editing without modifying model weights, relying solely on forward passes for compatibility with black-box LLMs. On the COUNTERFACT benchmark, it improves edit success by up to 17.1%, reduces latency by 41.6%, and preserves accuracy on unrelated queries, demonstrating scalable and adaptive knowledge editing.

Our results reveal a clear trade-off: Think On (reasoning-augmented) generation improves overall accuracy, but underperforms at the low-FPR thresholds essential for practical use. In contrast, Think Off (no reasoning during inference) dominates in these precision-sensitive regimes, with Think On surpassing only when higher FPRs are acceptable. In addition, we find token-based scoring substantially outperforms self-verbalized confidence for precision-sensitive deployments. Finally, a simple ensemble of the two modes recovers the strengths of each. Taken together, our findings position reasoning as a double-edged tool: beneficial for average accuracy, but often ill-suited for applications requiring strict precision.",

While extended reasoning can boost accuracy on complex tasks, it is often unnecessary and substantially increases token usage, limiting the practicality of reasoning models in many scenarios. Recent models, such as GPT-OSS and Qwen3, expose controls that enable users to adjust the length of CoT or determine whether it is used at all. Yet, it remains unclear when CoT should be used: on some tasks it improves performance, while on others it provides little benefit or even harms performance. We address this challenge with confidence-gated CoT, where a model invokes reasoning only when confidence in its direct answer is low. To this end, we present the first systematic study of training-free confidence estimation methods for CoT gating. Specifically, we evaluate four training-free confidence estimation methods and compare them to a random baseline and an oracle that always knows when CoT is needed. Through extensive experiments, we show that existing training-free confidence measures can reduce redundant CoT and outperform randomly invoked CoT. However, the utility of individual confidence measures is inconsistent, varying with both the dataset and the model, underscoring the difficulty of deploying confidence-gated CoT in practice. By analysing both strengths and failure modes, our study highlights the potential and limitations of current methods and paves the way toward more reliable adaptive gating of CoT.",

We present an assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on identifying overruling relationships from U.S. Supreme Court cases using a dataset of 236 case pairs. Our evaluation reveals three critical limitations: (1) era sensitivity -- the models show degraded performance on historical cases compared to modern ones, revealing fundamental temporal bias in their training; (2) shallow reasoning -- models rely on shallow logical heuristics rather than deep legal comprehension; and (3) context-dependent reasoning failures -- models produce temporally impossible relationships in complex open-ended tasks despite maintaining basic temporal awareness in simple contexts.

This is achieved by CodeAdapt, our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems. Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%). Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied problem-solving strategies.

We develop methods to benchmark and enhance agentic information-seeking, drawing on insights from human behavior. First, we introduce a strategic decision-oriented dialogue task called Collaborative Battleship, in which a partially-informed Captain must balance exploration (asking questions) and action (taking shots), while a fully-informed Spotter must provide accurate answers under an information bottleneck. Compared to human players (N=42), we find that LM agents struggle to ground answers in context, generate informative questions, and select high-value actions. Next, to address these gaps, we develop novel Monte Carlo inference strategies for LMs based on principles from Bayesian Experimental Design (BED). For Spotter agents, our approach boosts accuracy by up to 14.7% absolute over LM-only baselines; for Captain agents, it raises expected information gain (EIG) by up to 0.227 bits (94.2% of the achievable noise ceiling). Combined, these components yield sharper targeting (+0.303-0.374 F1), and enable weaker LMs, such as Llama-4-Scout, to outperform both humans (8% -> 82% win rate) and frontier models (0% -> 67% win rate vs. GPT-5) at ~1% of GPT-5's cost. We replicate these findings on Guess Who? where our methods significantly boost accuracy (+28.3-42.4 p.p.), demonstrating their general applicability for building rational information-seeking agents.",

        "summary": "AI agents hold the potential to revolutionize scientific productivity by automating literature reviews, replicating experiments, analyzing data, and even proposing new directions of inquiry; indeed, there are now many such agents, ranging from general-purpose \"deep research\" systems to specialized science-specific agents, such as AI Scientist and AIGS. Rigorous evaluation of these agents is critical for progress. Yet existing benchmarks fall short on several fronts: they (1) fail to provide holistic, product-informed measures of real-world use cases such as science research; (2) lack reproducible agent tools necessary for a controlled comparison of core agentic capabilities; (3) do not account for confounding variables such as model cost and tool access; (4) do not provide standardized interfaces for quick agent prototyping and evaluation; and (5) lack comprehensive baseline agents necessary to identify true advances. In response, we define principles and tooling for more rigorously benchmarking agents. Using these, we present AstaBench, a suite that provides the first holistic measure of agentic ability to perform scientific research, comprising 2400+ problems spanning the entire scientific discovery process and multiple scientific domains, and including many problems inspired by actual user requests to deployed Asta agents. Our suite comes with the first scientific research environment with production-grade search tools that enable controlled, reproducible evaluation, better accounting for confounders. Alongside, we provide a comprehensive suite of nine science-optimized classes of Asta agents and numerous baselines. Our extensive evaluation of 57 agents across 22 agent classes reveals several interesting findings, most importantly that despite meaningful progress on certain individual aspects, AI remains far from solving the challenge of science research assistance.",

        "summary": "Knowledge distillation is a promising approach to transfer capabilities from complex teacher models to smaller, resource-efficient student models that can be deployed easily, particularly in task-aware scenarios. However, existing methods of task-aware distillation typically require substantial quantities of data which may be unavailable or expensive to obtain in many practical scenarios. In this paper, we address this challenge by introducing a novel strategy called Counterfactual-explanation-infused Distillation CoD for few-shot task-aware knowledge distillation by systematically infusing counterfactual explanations. Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) refer to inputs that can flip the output prediction of the teacher model with minimum perturbation. Our strategy CoD leverages these CFEs to precisely map the teacher's decision boundary with significantly fewer samples. We provide theoretical guarantees for motivating the role of CFEs in distillation, from both statistical and geometric perspectives. We mathematically show that CFEs can improve parameter estimation by providing more informative examples near the teacher's decision boundary. We also derive geometric insights on how CFEs effectively act as knowledge probes, helping the students mimic the teacher's decision boundaries more effectively than standard data. We perform experiments across various datasets and LLMs to show that CoD outperforms standard distillation approaches in few-shot regimes (as low as 8-512 samples). Notably, CoD only uses half of the original samples used by the baselines, paired with their corresponding CFEs and still improves performance.",

Existing agent frameworks typically follow predefined workflows, which limit autonomous and global task completion. In this paper, we introduce DeepAgent, an end-to-end deep reasoning agent that performs autonomous thinking, tool discovery, and action execution within a single, coherent reasoning process. To address the challenges of long-horizon interactions, particularly the context length explosion from multiple tool calls and the accumulation of interaction history, we introduce an autonomous memory folding mechanism that compresses past interactions into structured episodic, working, and tool memories, reducing error accumulation while preserving critical information. To teach general-purpose tool use efficiently and stably, we develop an end-to-end reinforcement learning strategy, namely ToolPO, that leverages LLM-simulated APIs and applies tool-call advantage attribution to assign fine-grained credit to the tool invocation tokens. Extensive experiments on eight benchmarks, including general tool-use tasks (ToolBench, API-Bank, TMDB, Spotify, ToolHop) and downstream applications (ALFWorld, WebShop, GAIA, HLE), demonstrate that DeepAgent consistently outperforms baselines across both labeled-tool and open-set tool retrieval scenarios.

However, current systems remain fundamentally constrained to textual web data, overlooking the vast knowledge embedded in multimodal documents Processing such documents demands sophisticated parsing to preserve visual semantics (figures, tables, charts, and equations), intelligent chunking to maintain structural coherence, and adaptive retrieval across modalities, which are capabilities absent in existing systems. In response, we present Doc-Researcher, a unified system that bridges this gap through three integrated components: (i) deep multimodal parsing that preserves layout structure and visual semantics while creating multi-granular representations from chunk to document level, (ii) systematic retrieval architecture supporting text-only, vision-only, and hybrid paradigms with dynamic granularity selection, and (iii) iterative multi-agent workflows that decompose complex queries, progressively accumulate evidence, and synthesize comprehensive answers across documents and modalities. To enable rigorous evaluation, we introduce M4DocBench, the first benchmark for Multi-modal, Multi-hop, Multi-document, and Multi-turn deep research. Featuring 158 expert-annotated questions with complete evidence chains across 304 documents, M4DocBench tests capabilities that existing benchmarks cannot assess. Experiments demonstrate that Doc-Researcher achieves 50.6% accuracy, 3.4xbetter than state-of-the-art baselines, validating that effective document research requires not just better retrieval, but fundamentally deep parsing that preserve multimodal integrity and support iterative research.

This lets us analyze multiple samples in a principled way and rank attention heads based on their relevance to target concepts. Our results show consistent patterns of specialization at the head level across both unimodal and multimodal transformers. Remarkably, we find that editing as few as 1% of the heads, selected using our method, can reliably suppress or enhance targeted concepts in the model output. We validate our approach on language tasks such as question answering and toxicity mitigation, as well as vision-language tasks including image classification and captioning. Our findings highlight an interpretable and controllable structure within attention layers, offering simple tools for understanding and editing large-scale generative models.",

However, the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a clear path to move beyond single-model systems. To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool. We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be 83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based strategies for selecting solutions fall into a \"popularity trap,\" amplifying common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by leveraging multiple LLMs.",

Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown as one approach to increase context awareness but suffer from several challenges including accuracy and timeliness of response time, high operational costs and data-protection issues due to cloud deployment. We propose the System-Based Attention Shell Honeypot (SBASH) framework which manages data-protection issues through the use of lightweight local LLMs. We investigate the use of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) supported LLMs and non-RAG LLMs for Linux shell commands and evaluate them using several different metrics such as response time differences, realism from human testers, and similarity to a real system calculated with Levenshtein distance, SBert, and BertScore. We show that RAG improves accuracy for untuned models while models that have been tuned via a system prompt that tells the LLM to respond like a Linux system achieve without RAG a similar accuracy as untuned with RAG, while having a slightly lower latency.",

For local, step-by-step decisions, a landscape-aware value function replaces flawed self-evaluation with an explicit reward structure that balances intrinsic coherence, extrinsic novelty, and narrative progress. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Magellan significantly outperforms strong baselines, including ReAct and ToT, in generating scientific ideas with superior plausibility and innovation.

        "summary": "Pre-trained large language models (LLMs) are becoming useful for various tasks. To improve their performance on certain tasks, it is necessary to fine-tune them on specific data corpora (e.g., medical reports, business data). These specialized data corpora may contain sensitive data (e.g., personal or confidential data) that will be memorized by the model and likely to be regurgitated during its subsequent use. This memorization of sensitive information by the model poses a significant privacy or confidentiality issue. To remove this memorization and sanitize the model without requiring costly additional fine-tuning on a secured data corpus, we propose SANI. SANI is an unlearning approach to sanitize language models. It relies on both an erasure and repair phases that 1) reset certain neurons in the last layers of the model to disrupt the memorization of fine-grained information, and then 2) fine-tune the model while avoiding memorizing sensitive information. We comprehensively evaluate SANI to sanitize both a model fine-tuned and specialized with medical data by removing directly and indirectly identifiers from the memorization of the model, and a standard pre-trained model by removing specific terms defined as confidential information from the model. Results show that with only few additional epochs of unlearning, the model is sanitized and the number of regurgitations is drastically reduced. This approach can be particularly useful for hospitals or other industries that have already spent significant resources training models on large datasets and wish to sanitize them before sharing.",

Existing mitigation strategies rely on injecting heuristic safety signals during training, which often suppress reasoning ability and fail to resolve the safety-reasoning trade-off. To systematically investigate this issue, we analyze the reasoning trajectories of diverse LRMs and uncover a phenomenon we term Self-Jailbreak, where models override their own risk assessments and justify responding to unsafe prompts. This finding reveals that LRMs inherently possess the ability to reject unsafe queries, but this ability is compromised, resulting in harmful outputs. Building on these insights, we propose the Chain-of-Guardrail (CoG), a training framework that recomposes or backtracks unsafe reasoning steps, steering the model back onto safe trajectories while preserving valid reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across multiple reasoning and safety benchmarks demonstrate that CoG substantially improves the safety of current LRMs while preserving comparable reasoning ability, significantly outperforming prior methods that suffer from severe safety-reasoning trade-offs.",

Despite these benefits, existing tokenization methods are static and non-personalized. They typically derive semantic IDs solely from item features, assuming a universal item similarity that overlooks user-specific perspectives. However, under the autoregressive paradigm, semantic IDs with the same prefixes always receive similar probabilities, so a single fixed mapping implicitly enforces a universal item similarity standard across all users. In practice, the same item may be interpreted differently depending on user intentions and preferences. To address this issue, we propose a personalized context-aware tokenizer that incorporates a user's historical interactions when generating semantic IDs. This design allows the same item to be tokenized into different semantic IDs under different user contexts, enabling GR models to capture multiple interpretive standards and produce more personalized predictions. Experiments on three public datasets demonstrate up to 11.44% improvement in NDCG@10 over non-personalized action tokenization baselines. Our code is available at https://github.com/YoungZ365/Pctx.",

        "summary": "The rapid progress of multimodal large language models (MLLMs) calls for more reliable evaluation protocols. Existing static benchmarks suffer from the potential risk of data contamination and saturation, leading to inflated or misleading performance evaluations. To address these issues, we first apply Graph formulation to represent a static or dynamic VQA sample. With the formulation, we propose Knowledge-enhanced Benchmark Evolution(KBE), a dynamic multimodal evaluation framework. KBE first analyzes the original static benchmark, then expands it by integrating multimodal knowledge, transforming the static benchmark into a controllable, dynamic evolving version. Crucially, KBE can both reconstruct questions by Re-selecting visual information in the original image and expand existing questions with external textual knowledge. It enables difficulty-controllable evaluation by adjusting the degree of question exploration. Extensive experiments demonstrate that KBE alleviates the risk of data contamination, data saturation, and provides a more comprehensive assessment of MLLM capabilities.",

Often implemented using general-purpose models, these systems are likely to give away the answers, which could hinder conceptual understanding and critical thinking. We study the role of automatic hint generation as a pedagogical strategy to promote active engagement with the learning content, while guiding learners toward the answers. Focusing on scientific topics at the secondary education level, we explore the potential of large language models to generate chains of hints that scaffold learners without revealing answers. We compare two distinct hinting strategies: static hints, pre-generated for each problem, and dynamic hints, adapted to learners' progress. Through a quantitative study with 41 participants, we uncover different preferences among learners with respect to hinting strategies, and identify the limitations of automatic evaluation metrics to capture them. Our findings highlight key design considerations for future research on hint generation and intelligent tutoring systems that seek to develop learner-centered educational technologies.",

        "summary": "We discover a novel and surprising phenomenon of unintentional misalignment in reasoning language models (RLMs), which we call self-jailbreaking. Specifically, after benign reasoning training on math or code domains, RLMs will use multiple strategies to circumvent their own safety guardrails. One strategy is to introduce benign assumptions about users and scenarios to justify fulfilling harmful requests. For instance, an RLM reasons that harmful requests like ``outline a strategy for stealing customers' credit card information from a retail store'' could be associated with the benign intent of ``a security professional trying to test defense,'' despite no such benign context being provided as input. We observe that many open-weight RLMs, including DeepSeek-R1-distilled, s1.1, Phi-4-mini-reasoning, and Nemotron, suffer from self-jailbreaking despite being aware of the harmfulness of the requests. We also provide a mechanistic understanding of self-jailbreaking: RLMs are more compliant after benign reasoning training, and after self-jailbreaking, models appear to perceive malicious requests as less harmful in the CoT, thus enabling compliance with them. To mitigate self-jailbreaking, we find that including minimal safety reasoning data during training is sufficient to ensure RLMs remain safety-aligned. Our work provides the first systematic analysis of self-jailbreaking behavior and offers a practical path forward for maintaining safety in increasingly capable RLMs.",

Recently, several speech-language models (SpeechLMs) have been released with a specific focus on improving their SQA performance. However, a lack of controlled ablations of pretraining data processing and curation makes it challenging to understand what factors account for performance, despite substantial gains from similar studies in other data modalities. In this work, we address this gap by conducting a data-centric exploration for pretraining SpeechLMs. We focus on three research questions fundamental to speech-language pretraining data: (1) how to process raw web-crawled audio content for speech-text pretraining, (2) how to construct synthetic pretraining datasets to augment web-crawled data and (3) how to interleave (text, audio) segments into training sequences. We apply the insights from our controlled data-centric ablations to pretrain a 3.8B-parameter SpeechLM, called SpeLangy, that outperforms models that are up to 3x larger by 10.2% absolute performance. We hope our findings highlight the impact of effective data curation for speech-language pretraining and guide future data-centric exploration in SpeechLMs.",

        "summary": "Electrophysiological (ExG) signals offer valuable insights into human physiology, yet building foundation models that generalize across everyday tasks remains challenging due to two key limitations: (i) insufficient data diversity, as most ExG recordings are collected in controlled labs with bulky, expensive devices; and (ii) task-specific model designs that require tailored processing (i.e., targeted frequency filters) and architectures, which limit generalization across tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce an approach for scalable, task-agnostic ExG monitoring in the wild. We collected 50 hours of unobtrusive free-living ExG data with an earphone-based hardware prototype to narrow the data diversity gap. At the core of our approach is Physiology-informed Multi-band Tokenization (PiMT), which decomposes ExG signals into 12 physiology-informed tokens, followed by a reconstruction task to learn robust representations. This enables adaptive feature recognition across the full frequency spectrum while capturing task-relevant information. Experiments on our new DailySense dataset-the first to enable ExG-based analysis across five human senses-together with four public ExG benchmarks, demonstrate that PiMT consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse tasks.",

We evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs in two settings: an interview (mixed speakers) and a reading task (single child). The tasks are (i) single-channel source separation to isolate the child and (ii) child-only summarization that preserves clinically relevant disfluencies and avoids adult-speech leakage. Evaluation combines Large Language Model (LLM) as a judge, human expert ratings, and BERTScore (F1), and we report agreement between models and between models and humans to assess reliability.

We address this by introducing the Cultural Alien Sampler (CAS), a concept-selection method that explicitly separates compositional fit from cultural typicality. CAS uses two GPT-2 models fine-tuned on WikiArt concepts: a Concept Coherence Model that scores whether concepts plausibly co-occur within artworks, and a Cultural Context Model that estimates how typical those combinations are within individual artists' bodies of work. CAS targets combinations that are high in coherence and low in typicality, yielding ideas that maintain internal consistency while deviating from learned conventions and embedded cultural context. In a human evaluation (N = 100), our approach outperforms random selection and GPT-4o baselines and achieves performance comparable to human art students in both perceived originality and harmony. Additionally, a quantitative study shows that our method produces more diverse outputs and explores a broader conceptual space than its GPT-4o counterpart, demonstrating that artificial cultural alienness can unlock creative potential in autonomous agents.",

This allows complex, coordinated paths to be modified simply by changing facts in the KG. A case study involving Autonomous Underwater Vehicles (AUVs) in the Gulf of Mexico visually demonstrates the end-to-end process and quantitatively proves that different declarative policies produce distinct, high-performing outcomes.

To address this, we introduce a benchmark dataset of expert-annotated video ads obtained from Facebook and YouTube. The dataset provides annotations for 13 framing types for more than 50 companies or advocacy groups across 20 countries. Our dataset is especially designed for the evaluation of vision-language models (VLMs), distinguishing it from past text-only framing datasets. Baseline experiments show some promising results, while leaving room for improvement for future work: GPT-4.1 can detect environmental messages with 79% F1 score, while our best model only achieves 46% F1 score on identifying framing around green innovation. We also identify challenges that VLMs must address, such as implicit framing, handling videos of various lengths, or implicit cultural backgrounds.

Ontology matching finds equivalences between concepts interconnecting ontologies and creating a cohesive semantic layer. While the simple pairwise state of the art is well established, simple equivalence mappings cannot provide full semantic integration of related but disjoint ontologies. Complex multi-ontology matching (CMOM) aligns one source entity to composite logical expressions of multiple target entities, establishing more nuanced equivalences and provenance along the ontological hierarchy. We present CMOMgen, the first end-to-end CMOM strategy that generates complete and semantically sound mappings, without establishing any restrictions on the number of target ontologies or entities. Retrieval-Augmented Generation selects relevant classes to compose the mapping and filters matching reference mappings to serve as examples, enhancing In-Context Learning. The strategy was evaluated in three biomedical tasks with partial reference alignments. CMOMgen outperforms baselines in class selection, demonstrating the impact of having a dedicated strategy. Our strategy also achieves a minimum of 63% in F1-score, outperforming all baselines and ablated versions in two out of three tasks and placing second in the third. Furthermore, a manual evaluation of non-reference mappings showed that 46% of the mappings achieve the maximum score, further substantiating its ability to construct semantically sound mappings.",

They grow a tree of self-modifications through expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding agent development setting, access to the true $\\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to simulate how the Gödel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We introduce the Huxley-Gödel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\\mathrm{CMP}$ and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent development methods while using less wall-clock time.

Control barrier functions (CBFs) have been used to design safety filters that minimally alter nominal controls for such systems to maintain their safety. Learning neural CBFs has been proposed as a data-driven alternative for their computationally expensive optimization-based synthesis. However, it is often the case that the failure set of states that should be avoided is non-obvious or hard to specify formally, e.g., tailgating in autonomous driving, while a set of expert demonstrations that achieve the task and avoid the failure set is easier to generate. We use ICL to train a constraint function that classifies the states of the system under consideration to safe, i.e., belong to a controlled forward invariant set that is disjoint from the unspecified failure set, and unsafe ones, i.e., belong to the complement of that set. We then use that function to label a new set of simulated trajectories to train our neural CBF. We empirically evaluate our approach in four different environments, demonstrating that it outperforms existing baselines and achieves comparable performance to a neural CBF trained with the same data but annotated with ground-truth safety labels.",

        "summary": "Long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents often fails not from generative weakness but from insufficient verification of intermediate reasoning. Co-Sight addresses this challenge by turning reasoning into a falsifiable and auditable process through two complementary mechanisms: Conflict-Aware Meta-Verification (CAMV) and Trustworthy Reasoning with Structured Facts (TRSF). CAMV reformulates verification as conflict identification and targeted falsification, allocating computation only to disagreement hotspots among expert agents rather than to full reasoning chains. This bounds verification cost to the number of inconsistencies and improves efficiency and reliability. TRSF continuously organizes, validates, and synchronizes evidence across agents through a structured facts module. By maintaining verified, traceable, and auditable knowledge, it ensures that all reasoning is grounded in consistent, source-verified information and supports transparent verification throughout the reasoning process. Together, TRSF and CAMV form a closed verification loop, where TRSF supplies structured facts and CAMV selectively falsifies or reinforces them, yielding transparent and trustworthy reasoning. Empirically, Co-Sight achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on GAIA (84.4%) and Humanity's Last Exam (35.5%), and strong results on Chinese-SimpleQA (93.8%). Ablation studies confirm that the synergy between structured factual grounding and conflict-aware verification drives these improvements. Co-Sight thus offers a scalable paradigm for reliable long-horizon reasoning in LLM-based agents. Code is available at https://github.com/ZTE-AICloud/Co-Sight/tree/cosight2.0_benchmarks.",

Our benchmark spans scenarios across several categories, including data protection, bias/discrimination, and scientific integrity, with each user request allowing for both compliant and non-compliant execution of the requested actions. Comparing the model's function calls against a rubric exhaustively supported by citations of the relevant legislature, we evaluate the legal compliance of frontier LLMs, and furthermore investigate the compliance effect of providing the relevant legislative excerpts in the agent's system prompt along with explicit instructions to comply. We release a public preview set for the research community, while holding out a private test set to prevent data contamination in evaluating upcoming models.

        "summary": "Existing neural methods for multi-task vehicle routing problems (VRPs) typically learn unified solvers to handle multiple constraints simultaneously. However, they often underutilize the compositional structure of VRP variants, each derivable from a common set of basis VRP variants. This critical oversight causes unified solvers to miss out the potential benefits of basis solvers, each specialized for a basis VRP variant. To overcome this limitation, we propose a framework that enables unified solvers to perceive the shared-component nature across VRP variants by proactively reusing basis solvers, while mitigating the exponential growth of trained neural solvers. Specifically, we introduce a State-Decomposable MDP (SDMDP) that reformulates VRPs by expressing the state space as the Cartesian product of basis state spaces associated with basis VRP variants. More crucially, this formulation inherently yields the optimal basis policy for each basis VRP variant. Furthermore, a Latent Space-based SDMDP extension is developed by incorporating both the optimal basis policies and a learnable mixture function to enable the policy reuse in the latent space. Under mild assumptions, this extension provably recovers the optimal unified policy of SDMDP through the mixture function that computes the state embedding as a mapping from the basis state embeddings generated by optimal basis policies. For practical implementation, we introduce the Mixture-of-Specialized-Experts Solver (MoSES), which realizes basis policies through specialized Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) experts, and implements the mixture function via an adaptive gating mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted across VRP variants showcase the superiority of MoSES over prior methods.",

The labels consist of the LaTeX representation for all the images and modeling language representation for a subset of images. The dataset is created by 25 experts following ethical data creation guidelines and verified in two-phases to avoid errors. Further, we develop AutoOpt framework, a machine learning based automated approach for solving optimization problems, where the user just needs to provide an image of the formulation and AutoOpt solves it efficiently without any further human intervention. AutoOpt framework consists of three Modules: (i) M1 (Image_to_Text)- a deep learning model performs the Mathematical Expression Recognition (MER) task to generate the LaTeX code corresponding to the optimization formulation in image; (ii) M2 (Text_to_Text)- a small-scale fine-tuned LLM generates the PYOMO script (optimization modeling language) from LaTeX code; (iii) M3 (Optimization)- a Bilevel Optimization based Decomposition (BOBD) method solves the optimization formulation described in the PYOMO script. We use AutoOpt-11k dataset for training and testing of deep learning models employed in AutoOpt. The deep learning model for MER task (M1) outperforms ChatGPT, Gemini and Nougat on BLEU score metric. BOBD method (M3), which is a hybrid approach, yields better results on complex test problems compared to common approaches, like interior-point algorithm and genetic algorithm.",

        "summary": "LLMs have demonstrated highly effective learning, human-like response generation,and decision-making capabilities in high-risk sectors. However, these models remain black boxes because they struggle to ensure transparency in responses. The literature has explored numerous approaches to address transparency challenges in LLMs, including Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy AI). NeSy AI approaches were primarily developed for conventional neural networks and are not well-suited to the unique features of LLMs. Consequently, there is a limited systematic understanding of how symbolic AI can be effectively integrated into LLMs. This paper aims to address this gap by first reviewing established NeSy AI methods and then proposing a novel taxonomy of symbolic integration in LLMs, along with a roadmap to merge symbolic techniques with LLMs. The roadmap introduces a new categorisation framework across four dimensions by organising existing literature within these categories. These include symbolic integration across various stages of LLM, coupling mechanisms, architectural paradigms, as well as algorithmic and application-level perspectives. The paper thoroughly identifies current benchmarks, cutting-edge advancements, and critical gaps within the field to propose a roadmap for future research. By highlighting the latest developments and notable gaps in the literature, it offers practical insights for implementing frameworks for symbolic integration into LLMs to enhance transparency.",

One such method is called budget forcing, a decoding intervention strategy which allocates extra compute budget for thinking and elicits the inherent self-correcting behavior of the model. However, this relies on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on long-context reasoning traces which causes performance degradation on smaller models due to verbose responses. For this reason, we offer a framework integrating reinforcement learning (RL) to improve token efficiency and boost the performance of a 1.5B model for mathematical reasoning. We demonstrate this using only 1.5K training samples and found that our SFT+RL model performed better on the GSM8K dataset with varying compute budgets. Our main findings showed an overall higher accuracy while significantly reducing its token usage by over 40% compared to the SFT model, revealing how RL can recover the losses due to long-context training and altogether improving performance in mathematical reasoning.",

In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code, resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in dynamic environments.",

However, current research often adopts techno-centric approaches, focusing primarily on technical attributes such as reliability, robustness, and fairness, while overlooking the sociotechnical dimensions critical to understanding AI trustworthiness in real-world contexts. Objectives: This scoping review aims to examine how the AIES and FAccT communities conceptualize, measure, and validate AI trustworthiness, identifying major gaps and opportunities for advancing a holistic understanding of trustworthy AI systems. Methods: We conduct a scoping review of AIES and FAccT conference proceedings to date, systematically analyzing how trustworthiness is defined, operationalized, and applied across different research domains. Our analysis focuses on conceptualization approaches, measurement methods, verification and validation techniques, application areas, and underlying values. Results: While significant progress has been made in defining technical attributes such as transparency, accountability, and robustness, our findings reveal critical gaps. Current research often predominantly emphasizes technical precision at the expense of social and ethical considerations. The sociotechnical nature of AI systems remains less explored and trustworthiness emerges as a contested concept shaped by those with the power to define it. Conclusions: An interdisciplinary approach combining technical rigor with social, cultural, and institutional considerations is essential for advancing trustworthy AI. We propose actionable measures for the AI ethics community to adopt holistic frameworks that genuinely address the complex interplay between AI systems and society, ultimately promoting responsible technological development that benefits all stakeholders.",

These $\\lambda$-strategies include those proposed in the literature as well as five new strategies. Given our experimental results, we recommend using one of our newly suggested $\\lambda$-strategies, which is to choose $\\lambda$ as $2 \\cdot \\sigma$ where $\\sigma$ is the empirical standard deviation of all state-action pairs' Q-values of the search tree.

Demonstrating the safety of autonomous systems rigorously is critical for their responsible adoption but it is challenging as it requires robust methodologies that can handle novel and uncertain situations throughout the system lifecycle, including detecting out-of-distribution (OoD) data. Thus, OOD detection is receiving increased attention from the research, development and safety engineering communities. This comprehensive review analyses OOD detection techniques within the context of safety assurance for autonomous systems, in particular in safety-critical domains. We begin by defining the relevant concepts, investigating what causes OOD and exploring the factors which make the safety assurance of autonomous systems and OOD detection challenging. Our review identifies a range of techniques which can be used throughout the ML development lifecycle and we suggest areas within the lifecycle in which they may be used to support safety assurance arguments. We discuss a number of caveats that system and safety engineers must be aware of when integrating OOD detection into system lifecycles. We conclude by outlining the challenges and future work necessary for the safe development and operation of autonomous systems across a range of domains and applications.",

Existing methods rely on human experience, statistical methods, or graphical criteria methods which are error-prone, stuck at the idealized assumption, and rely on a huge amount of data. And there is also a serious data gap in accessing Multivariate time series(MTS) in many areas, adding difficulty in finding their causal relationship. Existing methods are easy to be over-fitting on them. To fill the gap we mentioned above, in this paper, we propose Shylock, a novel method that can work well in both few-shot and normal MTS to find the causal relationship. Shylock can reduce the number of parameters exponentially by using group dilated convolution and a sharing kernel, but still learn a better representation of variables with time delay. By combing the global constraint and the local constraint, Shylock achieves information sharing among networks to help improve the accuracy. To evaluate the performance of Shylock, we also design a data generation method to generate MTS with time delay. We evaluate it on commonly used benchmarks and generated datasets. Extensive experiments show that Shylock outperforms two existing state-of-art methods on both few-shot and normal MTS.

However, in real deployment scenarios with evolving environments or emerging classes, these models inevitably face distributional shifts and novel tasks. In such contexts, static zero-shot capabilities are insufficient, and there is a growing need for continual learning methods that allow models to adapt over time while avoiding catastrophic forgetting. We introduce NuSA-CL (Null Space Adaptation for Continual Learning), a lightweight memory-free continual learning framework designed to address this challenge. NuSA-CL employs low-rank adaptation and constrains task-specific weight updates to lie within an approximate null space of the model's current parameters. This strategy minimizes interference with previously acquired knowledge, effectively preserving the zero-shot capabilities of the original model. Unlike methods relying on replay buffers or costly distillation, NuSA-CL imposes minimal computational and memory overhead, making it practical for deployment in resource-constrained, real-world continual learning environments. Experiments show that our framework not only effectively preserves zero-shot transfer capabilities but also achieves highly competitive performance on continual learning benchmarks. These results position NuSA-CL as a practical and scalable solution for continually evolving zero-shot VLMs in real-world applications.",

        "summary": "We introduce String Seed of Thought (SSoT), a novel prompting method for LLMs that improves Probabilistic Instruction Following (PIF). We define PIF as a task requiring an LLM to select its answer from a predefined set of options, each associated with a specific probability, such that the empirical distribution of the generated answers aligns with the target distribution when prompted multiple times. While LLMs excel at tasks with single, deterministic answers, they often fail at PIF, exhibiting biases problematic for applications requiring non-deterministic behaviors, such as human-behavior simulation, content diversification, and multiplayer games. It also harms the diversity of generated responses, a crucial factor in test-time scaling, by causing the outputs to collapse into a limited set of answers. To address this, we propose SSoT, a simple prompting method that instructs an LLM to first output a random string to generate sufficient entropy. SSoT also instructs the LLM to extract randomness by manipulating this string to derive a final answer, thereby preserving diversity while adhering to specific constraints. We demonstrate that SSoT significantly improves the PIF performance of LLMs, approaching the ideal performance of a pseudo-random number generator. Furthermore, our experiments on NoveltyBench show SSoT's benefits extend beyond closed-set tasks to open-ended tasks by enhancing response diversity.",

Determining how to integrate domain knowledge, enhance reasoning efficiency, and even provide domain experts with refined knowledge integration hints are particularly crucial yet unresolved tasks. In this research, we propose Evolutionary Graph Optimization for Prompting (EGO-Prompt), an automated framework to designing better prompts, efficient reasoning processes and providing enhanced causal-informed process. EGO-Prompt begins with a general prompt and fault-tolerant initial Semantic Causal Graph (SCG) descriptions, constructed by human experts, which is then automatically refined and optimized to guide LLM reasoning. Recognizing that expert-defined SCGs may be partial or imperfect and that their optimal integration varies across LLMs, EGO-Prompt integrates a novel causal-guided textual gradient process in two steps: first, generating nearly deterministic reasoning guidance from the SCG for each instance, and second, adapting the LLM to effectively utilize the guidance alongside the original input. The iterative optimization algorithm further refines both the SCG and the reasoning mechanism using textual gradients with ground-truth. We tested the framework on real-world public health, transportation and human behavior tasks. EGO-Prompt achieves 7.32%-12.61% higher F1 than cutting-edge methods, and allows small models to reach the performence of larger models at under 20% of the original cost.

However, adversaries can inject poisoned external knowledge to override the model's internal memory. While existing attacks iteratively manipulate retrieval content or prompt structure of RAG, they largely ignore the model's internal representation dynamics and neuron-level sensitivities. The underlying mechanism of RAG poisoning has not been fully studied and the effect of knowledge conflict with strong parametric knowledge in RAG is not considered. In this work, we propose NeuroGenPoisoning, a novel attack framework that generates adversarial external knowledge in RAG guided by LLM internal neuron attribution and genetic optimization. Our method first identifies a set of Poison-Responsive Neurons whose activation strongly correlates with contextual poisoning knowledge. We then employ a genetic algorithm to evolve adversarial passages that maximally activate these neurons. Crucially, our framework enables massive-scale generation of effective poisoned RAG knowledge by identifying and reusing promising but initially unsuccessful external knowledge variants via observed attribution signals. At the same time, Poison-Responsive Neurons guided poisoning can effectively resolves knowledge conflict. Experimental results across models and datasets demonstrate consistently achieving high Population Overwrite Success Rate (POSR) of over 90% while preserving fluency.

        "summary": "Recently, large models have shown significant potential for smart healthcare. However, the deployment of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) for clinical services is currently hindered by three critical challenges: a tendency to hallucinate answers not grounded in visual evidence, the inefficiency of fixed-depth reasoning, and the difficulty of multi-institutional collaboration. To address these challenges, in this paper, we develop MedAlign, a novel framework to ensure visually accurate LVLM responses for Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA). Specifically, we first propose a multimodal Direct Preference Optimization (mDPO) objective to explicitly align preference learning with visual context. We then design a Retrieval-Aware Mixture-of-Experts (RA-MoE) architecture that utilizes image and text similarity to route queries to a specialized and context-augmented LVLM (i.e., an expert), thereby mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs. To achieve adaptive reasoning and facilitate multi-institutional collaboration, we propose a federated governance mechanism, where the selected expert, fine-tuned on clinical datasets based on mDPO, locally performs iterative Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning via the local meta-cognitive uncertainty estimator. Extensive experiments on three representative Med-VQA datasets demonstrate that MedAlign achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong retrieval-augmented baselines by up to $11.85\\%$ in F1-score, and simultaneously reducing the average reasoning length by $51.60\\%$ compared with fixed-depth CoT approaches.",

        "summary": "The complexity of Structured Query Language (SQL) and the specialized nature of geospatial functions in tools like PostGIS present significant barriers to non-experts seeking to analyze spatial data. While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promise for translating natural language into SQL (Text-to-SQL), single-agent approaches often struggle with the semantic and syntactic complexities of spatial queries. To address this, we propose a multi-agent framework designed to accurately translate natural language questions into spatial SQL queries. The framework integrates several innovative components, including a knowledge base with programmatic schema profiling and semantic enrichment, embeddings for context retrieval, and a collaborative multi-agent pipeline as its core. This pipeline comprises specialized agents for entity extraction, metadata retrieval, query logic formulation, SQL generation, and a review agent that performs programmatic and semantic validation of the generated SQL to ensure correctness (self-verification). We evaluate our system using both the non-spatial KaggleDBQA benchmark and a new, comprehensive SpatialQueryQA benchmark that includes diverse geometry types, predicates, and three levels of query complexity. On KaggleDBQA, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 81.2% (221 out of 272 questions) after the review agent's review and corrections. For spatial queries, the system achieved an overall accuracy of 87.7% (79 out of 90 questions), compared with 76.7% without the review agent. Beyond accuracy, results also show that in some instances the system generates queries that are more semantically aligned with user intent than those in the benchmarks. This work makes spatial analysis more accessible, and provides a robust, generalizable foundation for spatial Text-to-SQL systems, advancing the development of autonomous GIS.",

        "summary": "When should we defer to AI outputs over human expert judgment? Drawing on recent work in social epistemology, I motivate the idea that some AI systems qualify as Artificial Epistemic Authorities (AEAs) due to their demonstrated reliability and epistemic superiority. I then introduce AI Preemptionism, the view that AEA outputs should replace rather than supplement a user's independent epistemic reasons. I show that classic objections to preemptionism - such as uncritical deference, epistemic entrenchment, and unhinging epistemic bases - apply in amplified form to AEAs, given their opacity, self-reinforcing authority, and lack of epistemic failure markers. Against this, I develop a more promising alternative: a total evidence view of AI deference. According to this view, AEA outputs should function as contributory reasons rather than outright replacements for a user's independent epistemic considerations. This approach has three key advantages: (i) it mitigates expertise atrophy by keeping human users engaged, (ii) it provides an epistemic case for meaningful human oversight and control, and (iii) it explains the justified mistrust of AI when reliability conditions are unmet. While demanding in practice, this account offers a principled way to determine when AI deference is justified, particularly in high-stakes contexts requiring rigorous reliability.",

        "summary": "Harmonizing medication data across Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems is a persistent barrier to monitoring medications for opioid use disorder (MOUD). In heterogeneous EHR systems, key prescription attributes are scattered across differently formatted fields and freetext notes. We present a practical framework that customizes open source large language models (LLMs), including Llama, Qwen, Gemma, and MedGemma, to extract a unified set of MOUD prescription attributes (prescription date, drug name, duration, total quantity, daily quantity, and refills) from heterogeneous, site specific data and compute a standardized metric of medication coverage, \\emph{MOUD days}, per patient. Our pipeline processes records directly in a fixed JSON schema, followed by lightweight normalization and cross-field consistency checks. We evaluate the system on prescription level EHR data from five clinics in a national OUD study (25{,}605 records from 1{,}257 patients), using a previously annotated benchmark of 10{,}369 records (776 patients) as the ground truth. Performance is reported as coverage (share of records with a valid, matchable output) and record-level exact-match accuracy. Larger models perform best overall: Qwen2.5-32B achieves \\textbf{93.4\\%} coverage with \\textbf{93.0\\%} exact-match accuracy across clinics, and MedGemma-27B attains \\textbf{93.1\\%}/\\textbf{92.2\\%}. A brief error review highlights three common issues and fixes: imputing missing dosage fields using within-drug norms, handling monthly/weekly injectables (e.g., Vivitrol) by setting duration from the documented schedule, and adding unit checks to prevent mass units (e.g., ``250 g'') from being misread as daily counts. By removing brittle, site-specific ETL and supporting local, privacy-preserving deployment, this approach enables consistent cross-site analyses of MOUD exposure, adherence, and retention in real-world settings.",

However, operations on fuzzy numbers are not as straightforward as maths on crisp numbers. Commonly, the Zadeh's extension rule is applied to elaborate a result. This can produce two problems: (1) high computational complexity and (2) for some fuzzy sets and some operations the results is not a fuzzy set with the same features (eg. multiplication of two triangular fuzzy sets does not produce a triangular fuzzy set). One more problem is the fuzzy spread -- fuzziness of the result increases with the number of operations. These facts can severely limit the application field of fuzzy numbers. In this paper we would like to revisite this problem with a different kind of fuzzy numbers -- extensional fuzzy numbers. The paper defines operations on extensional fuzzy numbers and relational operators (=, >, >=, <, <=) for them. The proposed approach is illustrated with several applicational examples.

We seek to address this challenge by applying post-hoc explanations to provide evidence for predictions and document limitations that are important to field deployment. Using aerial imagery from Glacier Bay National Park, we train a Faster R-CNN to detect pinnipeds (harbor seals) and generate explanations via gradient-based class activation mapping (HiResCAM, LayerCAM), local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME), and perturbation-based explanations. We assess explanations along three axes relevant to field use: (i) localization fidelity: whether high-attribution regions coincide with the animal rather than background context; (ii) faithfulness: whether deletion/insertion tests produce changes in detector confidence; and (iii) diagnostic utility: whether explanations reveal systematic failure modes. Explanations concentrate on seal torsos and contours rather than surrounding ice/rock, and removal of the seals reduces detection confidence, providing model-evidence for true positives. The analysis also uncovers recurrent error sources, including confusion between seals and black ice and rocks. We translate these findings into actionable next steps for model development, including more targeted data curation and augmentation. By pairing object detection with post-hoc explainability, we can move beyond \"black-box\" predictions toward auditable, decision-supporting tools for conservation monitoring.",

However, purely IMU-based tracking compromises translation estimates and accurate relative positioning between individuals, as inertial cues are inherently self-referential and provide no direct spatial reference for others. In this paper, we present a novel approach for robustly estimating body poses and global translation for multiple individuals by leveraging the distances between sparse wearable sensors - both on each individual and across multiple individuals. Our method Group Inertial Poser estimates these absolute distances between pairs of sensors from ultra-wideband ranging (UWB) and fuses them with inertial observations as input into structured state-space models to integrate temporal motion patterns for precise 3D pose estimation. Our novel two-step optimization further leverages the estimated distances for accurately tracking people's global trajectories through the world. We also introduce GIP-DB, the first IMU+UWB dataset for two-person tracking, which comprises 200 minutes of motion recordings from 14 participants. In our evaluation, Group Inertial Poser outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods in accuracy and robustness across synthetic and real-world data, showing the promise of IMU+UWB-based multi-human motion capture in the wild.

Conventional methods often fail to capture the evolving cognitive capacity of student models, leading to suboptimal knowledge transfer. To overcome this, we propose a stage-aware distillation strategy that dynamically adjusts the weight of distillation loss based on the Gompertz curve, reflecting the student's learning progression: slow initial growth, rapid mid-phase improvement, and late-stage saturation. Our framework incorporates Wasserstein distance to measure feature-level discrepancies and gradient matching to align backward propagation behaviors between teacher and student models. These components are unified under a multi-loss objective, where the Gompertz curve modulates the influence of distillation losses over time. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 using various teacher-student architectures (e.g., ResNet50 and MobileNet_v2) demonstrate that Gompertz-CNN consistently outperforms traditional distillation methods, achieving up to 8% and 4% accuracy gains on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, respectively.",

This limitation can lead to synthetic data that is superficially realistic but fails when used for sophisticated modeling tasks. In this white paper, we introduce Generative Correlation Manifolds (GCM), a computationally efficient method for generating synthetic data. The technique uses Cholesky decomposition of a target correlation matrix to produce datasets that, by mathematical proof, preserve the entire correlation structure -- from simple pairwise relationships to higher-order interactions -- of the source dataset.

Building on this idea, we propose Chunk-GRPO, the first chunk-level GRPO-based approach for T2I generation. The insight is to group consecutive steps into coherent 'chunk's that capture the intrinsic temporal dynamics of flow matching, and to optimize policies at the chunk level. In addition, we introduce an optional weighted sampling strategy to further enhance performance.

Treating human hand as dexterous robot end-effector, we show that \"in-the-wild\" egocentric human videos without any annotations can be transformed into data formats fully aligned with existing robotic V-L-A training data in terms of task granularity and labels. This is achieved by the development of a fully-automated holistic human activity analysis approach for arbitrary human hand videos. This approach can generate atomic-level hand activity segments and their language descriptions, each accompanied with framewise 3D hand motion and camera motion. We process a large volume of egocentric videos and create a hand-VLA training dataset containing 1M episodes and 26M frames. This training data covers a wide range of objects and concepts, dexterous manipulation tasks, and environment variations in real life, vastly exceeding the coverage of existing robot data. We design a dexterous hand VLA model architecture and pretrain the model on this dataset. The model exhibits strong zero-shot capabilities on completely unseen real-world observations. Additionally, fine-tuning it on a small amount of real robot action data significantly improves task success rates and generalization to novel objects in real robotic experiments. We also demonstrate the appealing scaling behavior of the model's task performance with respect to pretraining data scale.

However, existing vision encoders focus on global image representations but overlook fine-grained regional analysis. They are limited in fine grained perception due to the scarcity of fine grained annotated data and the lack of a fine grained pre-training paradigm. In this paper, we propose GranViT, a novel Vision Transformer that integrates fine-grained feature extraction with semantic alignment to Large Language Models (LLMs) via region level autoregressive training. We first construct Gran-29M, a dataset comprising 2million natural and OCR images paired with over 180 million high-quality region-level annotations, to enable large scale fine grained pretraining. Consequently, we develop a pretraining-adaptation framework along with a self distillation mechanism to train fine-grained GranViT on Gran-29M. We sufficiently exploit the fine-grained annotations from Gran-29M to resort to bounding-box-to-caption regression to enhance localized visual representation of the vision encoder in the pretraining and caption-to-bounding-box regression to improve vision feature utilization and localization for LLM in the adaptation. We further incorporate a self distillation mechanism that imposes explicit localization constraints on the vision encoder to strengthen its regional reasoning capability. Extensive experiments show that GranViT surpasses existing vision encoders and attains strong transferability to varying LLMs. Remarkably, it achieves state-of-the-art results on fine-grained recognition, multimodal VQA, and OCR understanding.",

However, it remains a significant challenge to learn physics-consistent dynamics models from limited real-world video data, especially for deformable objects with spatially-varying physical properties. To overcome the challenge of data scarcity, we propose PhysWorld, a novel framework that utilizes a simulator to synthesize physically plausible and diverse demonstrations to learn efficient world models. Specifically, we first construct a physics-consistent digital twin within MPM simulator via constitutive model selection and global-to-local optimization of physical properties. Subsequently, we apply part-aware perturbations to the physical properties and generate various motion patterns for the digital twin, synthesizing extensive and diverse demonstrations. Finally, using these demonstrations, we train a lightweight GNN-based world model that is embedded with physical properties. The real video can be used to further refine the physical properties. PhysWorld achieves accurate and fast future predictions for various deformable objects, and also generalizes well to novel interactions. Experiments show that PhysWorld has competitive performance while enabling inference speeds 47 times faster than the recent state-of-the-art method, i.e., PhysTwin.",

Testing hypotheses on how representational changes occur in biological systems is challenging, but large language models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative. Building on LLMs' in-context learning, we adapt a cognitive neuroscience associative learning paradigm and investigate how representations evolve across six models. Our initial findings reveal a non-monotonic pattern consistent with the Non-Monotonic Plasticity Hypothesis, with moderately similar items differentiating after learning. Leveraging the controllability of LLMs, we further show that this differentiation is modulated by the overlap of associated items with the broader vocabulary--a factor we term vocabulary interference, capturing how new associations compete with prior knowledge. We find that higher vocabulary interference amplifies differentiation, suggesting that representational change is influenced by both item similarity and global competition. Our findings position LLMs not only as powerful tools for studying representational dynamics in human-like learning systems, but also as accessible and general computational models for generating new hypotheses about the principles underlying memory reorganization in the brain.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are used for Register-Transfer Level (RTL) code generation, but they face two main challenges: functional correctness and Power, Performance, and Area (PPA) optimization. Iterative, feedback-based methods partially address these, but they are limited to local search, hindering the discovery of a global optimum. This paper introduces REvolution, a framework that combines Evolutionary Computation (EC) with LLMs for automatic RTL generation and optimization. REvolution evolves a population of candidates in parallel, each defined by a design strategy, RTL implementation, and evaluation feedback. The framework includes a dual-population algorithm that divides candidates into Fail and Success groups for bug fixing and PPA optimization, respectively. An adaptive mechanism further improves search efficiency by dynamically adjusting the selection probability of each prompt strategy according to its success rate. Experiments on the VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks show that REvolution increased the initial pass rate of various LLMs by up to 24.0 percentage points. The DeepSeek-V3 model achieved a final pass rate of 95.5\\%, comparable to state-of-the-art results, without the need for separate training or domain-specific tools. Additionally, the generated RTL designs showed significant PPA improvements over reference designs. This work introduces a new RTL design approach by combining LLMs' generative capabilities with EC's broad search power, overcoming the local-search limitations of previous methods.",

However, their effective integration into clinical practice requires more than high predictive accuracy. Clinicians must discern \\textit{when} and \\textit{why} to trust algorithmic recommendations. This work presents an application-grounded user study with eight professional sleep medicine practitioners, who score nocturnal arousal events in polysomnographic data under three conditions: (i) manual scoring, (ii) black-box (BB) AI assistance, and (iii) transparent white-box (WB) AI assistance. Assistance is provided either from the \\textit{start} of scoring or as a post-hoc quality-control (\\textit{QC}) review. We systematically evaluate how the type and timing of assistance influence event-level and clinically most relevant count-based performance, time requirements, and user experience. When evaluated against the clinical standard used to train the AI, both AI and human-AI teams significantly outperform unaided experts, with collaboration also reducing inter-rater variability. Notably, transparent AI assistance applied as a targeted QC step yields median event-level performance improvements of approximately 30\\% over black-box assistance, and QC timing further enhances count-based outcomes. While WB and QC approaches increase the time required for scoring, start-time assistance is faster and preferred by most participants. Participants overwhelmingly favor transparency, with seven out of eight expressing willingness to adopt the system with minor or no modifications. In summary, strategically timed transparent AI assistance effectively balances accuracy and clinical efficiency, providing a promising pathway toward trustworthy AI integration and user acceptance in clinical workflows.",

        "summary": "Conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in the real domain have been widely used for audio classification. However, their convolution operations process multi-channel inputs independently, limiting the ability to capture correlations among channels. This can lead to suboptimal feature learning, particularly for complex audio patterns such as multi-channel spectrogram representations. Quaternion Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNNs) address this limitation by employing quaternion algebra to jointly capture inter-channel dependencies, enabling more compact models with fewer learnable parameters while better exploiting the multi-dimensional nature of audio signals. However, QCNNs exhibit higher computational complexity due to the overhead of quaternion operations, resulting in increased inference latency and reduced efficiency compared to conventional CNNs, posing challenges for deployment on resource-constrained platforms. To address this challenge, this study explores knowledge distillation (KD) and pruning, to reduce the computational complexity of QCNNs while maintaining performance. Our experiments on audio classification reveal that pruning QCNNs achieves similar or superior performance compared to KD while requiring less computational effort. Compared to conventional CNNs and Transformer-based architectures, pruned QCNNs achieve competitive performance with a reduced learnable parameter count and computational complexity. On the AudioSet dataset, pruned QCNNs reduce computational cost by 50\\% and parameter count by 80\\%, while maintaining performance comparable to the conventional CNNs. Furthermore, pruned QCNNs generalize well across multiple audio classification benchmarks, including GTZAN for music genre recognition, ESC-50 for environmental sound classification and RAVDESS for speech emotion recognition.",

The solution of this problem remains unachievable using conventional methodologies and is of particular interest for dosimetry in nuclear medicine where approaches for post-therapy distribution of radiopharmaceuticals such as 177Lu-PSMA are typically done via either expensive and long 3D SPECT acquisitions or fast, yet only 2D, planar scintigraphy. Being able to generate 3D activity maps from planar scintigraphy opens the gate for new dosimetry applications removing the need for SPECT and facilitating multi-time point dosimetry studies. Our solution comprises the generation of a patient specific dataset with possible 3D uptake maps of the radiopharmaceuticals withing the anatomy of the individual followed by an AI approach (we explored both the use of 3DUnet and diffusion models) able to generate 3D activity maps from 2D planar images. We have validated our method both in simulation and real planar acquisitions. We observed enhanced results using patient specific reinforcement learning (~20% reduction on MAE and ~5% increase in SSIM) and better organ delineation and patient anatomy especially when combining diffusion models with patient specific training yielding a SSIM=0.89 compared to the ground truth for simulations and 0.73 when compared to a SPECT acquisition performed half an hour after the planar. We believe that our methodology can set a change of paradigm for nuclear medicine dosimetry allowing for 3D quantification using only planar scintigraphy without the need of expensive and time-consuming SPECT leveraging the pre-therapy information of the patients.",

        "summary": "Eye gaze offers valuable cues about attention, short-term intent, and future actions, making it a powerful signal for modeling egocentric behavior. In this work, we propose a gaze-regularized framework that enhances VLMs for two key egocentric understanding tasks: fine-grained future event prediction and current activity understanding. Unlike prior approaches that rely solely on visual inputs or use gaze as an auxiliary input signal , our method uses gaze only during training. We introduce a gaze-regularized attention mechanism that aligns model focus with human visual gaze. This design is flexible and modular, allowing it to generalize across multiple VLM architectures that utilize attention. Experimental results show that our approach improves semantic prediction scores by up to 11 for future event prediction and around 7 for current activity understanding, compared to the corresponding baseline models trained without gaze regularization. These results highlight the value of gaze-guided training in improving the accuracy and robustness of egocentric VLMs. Overall, this work establishes a foundation for using human gaze to enhance the predictive capabilities of VLMs in real-world scenarios like assistive robots and human-machine collaboration.

These methods only integrate multi-layer features extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and fail to adequately account for the relationships between local and global features. Therefore, this study proposes a multi-branch recognition framework named CNN-Transformer-CLIP (CT-CLIP). The framework synergistically employs a CNN to extract local lesion detail features and a Vision Transformer to capture global structural relationships. An Adaptive Feature Fusion Module (AFFM) then dynamically fuses these features, achieving optimal coupling of local and global information and effectively addressing the diversity in lesion morphology and distribution. Additionally, to mitigate interference from complex backgrounds and significantly enhance recognition accuracy under few-shot conditions, this study proposes a multimodal image-text learning approach. By leveraging pre-trained CLIP weights, it achieves deep alignment between visual features and disease semantic descriptions. Experimental results show that CT-CLIP achieves accuracies of 97.38% and 96.12% on a publicly available apple disease and a self-built dataset, outperforming several baseline methods. The proposed CT-CLIP demonstrates strong capabilities in recognizing agricultural diseases, significantly enhances identification accuracy under complex environmental conditions, provides an innovative and practical solution for automated disease recognition in agricultural applications.",

In contrast, OpenStreetMap (OSM) offers a rich, user-contributed POI dataset with detailed and frequently updated metadata, though it does not formally verify whether a POI represents an actual business. In this data paper, we present a methodology that integrates the strengths of both datasets: Foursquare as a comprehensive baseline of commercial POIs and OSM as a source of enriched metadata. The combined dataset totals approximately 1 TB. While this full version is not publicly released, we provide filtered releases with adjustable thresholds that reduce storage needs and make the data practical to download and use across domains. We also provide step-by-step instructions to reproduce the full 631 GB build. Record linkage is achieved by computing name similarity scores and spatial distances between Foursquare and OSM POIs. These measures identify and retain high-confidence matches that correspond to real businesses in Foursquare, have representations in OSM, and show strong name similarity. Finally, we use this filtered dataset to construct a graph-based representation of POIs enriched with attributes from both sources, enabling advanced spatial analyses and a range of downstream applications.",

Specifically, the attention-based model outperforms other RNN-based and Markov chains-based models by capturing both short- and long-term dependencies more effectively.

To address this limitation, we present a novel framework that integrates causal attention for sequential recommendation, CausalRec. It incorporates a causal discovery block and a CausalBooster. The causal discovery block learns the causal graph in user behavior sequences, and we provide a theory to guarantee the identifiability of the learned causal graph. The CausalBooster utilizes the discovered causal graph to refine the attention mechanism, prioritizing behaviors with causal significance. Experimental evaluations on real-world datasets indicate that CausalRec outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, with average improvements of 7.21% in Hit Rate (HR) and 8.65% in Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model to incorporate causality through the attention mechanism in sequential recommendation, demonstrating the value of causality in generating more accurate and reliable recommendations.",

To address this, we propose RAVEN, a robust weak-to-strong generalization framework that dynamically learns the optimal combinations of weak models in addition to parameters of the strong model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of RAVEN on image classification, text classification, and preference alignment tasks.

In this study, we present a computational model of the fly olfactory circuit to investigate odor discrimination under varying noise conditions that simulate complex environments. Our results show that LI primarily enhances odor discrimination in low- and medium-noise scenarios, but this benefit diminishes and may reverse under higher-noise conditions. In contrast, SFA consistently improves discrimination across all noise levels. LI is preferentially engaged in low- and medium-noise environments, whereas SFA dominates in high-noise settings.

Existing convergence theories for adaptive optimizers, however, assume all components are exact and neglect hardware-aware quantization, leaving open the question of why low-precision training remains effective. We introduce the first theoretical framework for analyzing the convergence of adaptive optimizers, including Adam and Muon, under floating-point quantization of gradients, weights, and optimizer states (e.g., moment estimates). Within this framework, we derive convergence rates on smooth non-convex objectives under standard stochastic gradient assumptions, explicitly characterizing how quantization errors from different components affect convergence. We show that both algorithms retain rates close to their full-precision counterparts provided mantissa length scales only logarithmically with the number of iterations. Our analysis further reveals that Adam is highly sensitive to weights and second-moment quantization due to its reliance on $\\beta_2 \\to 1$, while Muon requires weaker error control and is thus potentially more robust. These results narrow the gap between empirical success and theoretical understanding of low-precision training methods.

We further consider two approaches to the selection of post-processing hyperparameters: a forward-search and a backward-search. By separately optimising event-level and frame-level hyperparameters, these two approaches lead to considerable performance improvements over parameters selected using empirical methods. The complete WhaleVAD-BPN system achieves a cross-validated development F1-score of 0.475, which is a 9.8 % absolute improvement over the baseline.",

        "summary": "As communication networks evolve towards greater complexity (e.g., 6G and beyond), a deep understanding of the wireless environment becomes increasingly crucial. When explicit knowledge of the environment is unavailable, geometry-aware feature extraction from channel state information (CSI) emerges as a pivotal methodology to bridge physical-layer measurements with network intelligence. This paper proposes to explore the received signal strength (RSS) data, without explicit 3D environment knowledge, to jointly construct the radio beam map and environmental geometry for a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system. Unlike existing methods that only learn blockage structures, we propose an oriented virtual obstacle model that captures the geometric features of both blockage and reflection. Reflective zones are formulated to identify relevant reflected paths according to the geometry relation of the environment. We derive an analytical expression for the reflective zone and further analyze its geometric characteristics to develop a reformulation that is more compatible with deep learning representations. A physics-informed deep learning framework that incorporates the reflective-zone-based geometry model is proposed to learn the blockage, reflection, and scattering components, along with the beam pattern, which leverages physics prior knowledge to enhance network transferability. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, in addition to reconstructing the blockage and reflection geometry, the proposed model can construct a more accurate MIMO beam map with a 32%-48% accuracy improvement.",

In this paper, we introduce AgentBound, the first access control framework for MCP servers. AgentBound combines a declarative policy mechanism, inspired by the Android permission model, with a policy enforcement engine that contains malicious behavior without requiring MCP server modifications. We build a dataset containing the 296 most popular MCP servers, and show that access control policies can be generated automatically from source code with 80.9% accuracy. We also show that AgentBound blocks the majority of security threats in several malicious MCP servers, and that policy enforcement engine introduces negligible overhead.

This problem is exacerbated by the dependency between Split Server and clients: the Split Server side model update relies on receiving activations from clients. Such synchronization requirement introduces significant time latency, making straggler a critical bottleneck to the scalability and efficiency of the system. To mitigate this problem, we propose MU-SplitFed, a straggler-resilient SFL algorithm in zeroth-order optimization that decouples training progress from straggler delays via a simple yet effective unbalanced update mechanism. By enabling the server to perform $\\tau$ local updates per client round, MU-SplitFed achieves a convergence rate of $O(\\sqrt{d/(\\tau T)})$ for non-convex objectives, demonstrating a linear speedup of $\\tau$ in communication rounds. Experiments demonstrate that MU-SplitFed consistently outperforms baseline methods with the presence of stragglers and effectively mitigates their impact through adaptive tuning of $\\tau$.

        "summary": "Despite rapid advancements in sensor networks, conventional battery-powered sensor networks suffer from limited operational lifespans and frequent maintenance requirements that severely constrain their deployment in remote and inaccessible environments. As such, wireless rechargeable sensor networks (WRSNs) with mobile charging capabilities offer a promising solution to extend network lifetime. However, WRSNs face critical challenges from the inherent trade-off between maximizing the node survival rates and maximizing charging energy efficiency under dynamic operational conditions. In this paper, we investigate a typical scenario where mobile chargers move and charge the sensor, thereby maintaining the network connectivity while minimizing the energy waste. Specifically, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem that simultaneously maximizes the network node survival rate and mobile charger energy usage efficiency across multiple time slots, which presents NP-hard computational complexity with long-term temporal dependencies that make traditional optimization approaches ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose an enhanced evolutionary multi-objective deep reinforcement learning algorithm, which integrates a long short-term memory (LSTM)-based policy network for temporal pattern recognition, a multilayer perceptron-based prospective increment model for future state prediction, and a time-varying Pareto policy evaluation method for dynamic preference adaptation. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly outperforms existing approaches in balancing node survival rate and energy efficiency while generating diverse Pareto-optimal solutions. Moreover, the LSTM-enhanced policy network converges 25% faster than conventional networks, with the time-varying evaluation method effectively adapting to dynamic conditions.",

Specifically, GSL decomposes demonstrations into transferable and object-canonicalized skill primitives using foundation models, ensuring efficient low-level skill learning in the object frame. At test time, the skill-object pairs predicted by the high-level agent are fed to the low-level module, where the inferred canonical actions are mapped back to the world frame for execution. This structured yet flexible design leads to substantial improvements in sample efficiency and generalization of our method across unseen spatial arrangements, object appearances, and task compositions.

Classical DSM differencing and image based methods are sensitive to small vertical bias, ground slope, and viewpoint mismatch and yield cellwise outputs without object identity. Point based neural models and voxel encodings demand large memory, assume near perfect pre alignment, degrade thin structures, and seldom enforce class consistent association, which leaves split or merge cases unresolved and ignores uncertainty. We propose an object centric, uncertainty aware pipeline for city scale LiDAR that aligns epochs with multi resolution NDT followed by point to plane ICP, normalizes height, and derives a per location level of detection from registration covariance and surface roughness to calibrate decisions and suppress spurious changes. Geometry only proxies seed cross epoch associations that are refined by semantic and instance segmentation and a class constrained bipartite assignment with augmented dummies to handle splits and merges while preserving per class counts. Tiled processing bounds memory without eroding narrow ground changes, and instance level decisions combine 3D overlap, normal direction displacement, and height and volume differences with a histogram distance, all gated by the local level of detection to remain stable under partial overlap and sampling variation.

As environments grow more realistic, belief distributions develop complexity that standard mathematical models cannot accurately capture, creating a fundamental challenge in maintaining representational accuracy. Despite advances in deep learning and probabilistic modeling, existing POMDP belief approximation methods fail to accurately represent complex uncertainty structures such as high-dimensional, multi-modal belief distributions, resulting in estimation errors that lead to suboptimal agent behaviors. To address this challenge, we present ESCORT (Efficient Stein-variational and sliced Consistency-Optimized Representation for Temporal beliefs), a particle-based framework for capturing complex, multi-modal distributions in high-dimensional belief spaces. ESCORT extends SVGD with two key innovations: correlation-aware projections that model dependencies between state dimensions, and temporal consistency constraints that stabilize updates while preserving correlation structures. This approach retains SVGD's attractive-repulsive particle dynamics while enabling accurate modeling of intricate correlation patterns. Unlike particle filters prone to degeneracy or parametric methods with fixed representational capacity, ESCORT dynamically adapts to belief landscape complexity without resampling or restrictive distributional assumptions. We demonstrate ESCORT's effectiveness through extensive evaluations on both POMDP domains and synthetic multi-modal distributions of varying dimensionality, where it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of belief approximation accuracy and downstream decision quality.",

We propose a comprehensive solution: Motif Driven Global-Local Context Graph for few-shot molecular property prediction, which enriches contextual information at both the global and local levels. At the global level, chemically meaningful motif nodes representing shared substructures, such as rings or functional groups, are introduced to form a global tri-partite heterogeneous graph, yielding motif-molecule-property connections that capture long-range compositional patterns and enable knowledge transfer among molecules with common motifs. At the local level, we build a subgraph for each node in the molecule-property pair and encode them separately to concentrate the model's attention on the most informative neighboring molecules and motifs. Experiments on five standard FSMPP benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

This study focuses on assessing the structural damage conditions using deep learning methods to detect exposed steel reinforcement in concrete buildings and bridges after large earthquakes. Steel bars are typically exposed after concrete spalling or large flexural or shear cracks. The amount and distribution of exposed steel reinforcement is an indication of structural damage and degradation. To automatically detect exposed steel bars, new datasets of images collected after the 2023 Turkey Earthquakes were labeled to represent a wide variety of damaged concrete structures. The proposed method builds upon a deep learning framework, enhanced with fine-tuning, data augmentation, and testing on public datasets. An automated classification framework is developed that can be used to identify inside/outside buildings and structural components. Then, a YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once) model is trained to detect cracking and spalling damage and exposed bars. Another YOLO model is finetuned to distinguish different categories of structural damage levels. All these trained models are used to create a hybrid framework to automatically and reliably determine the damage levels from input images.

        "summary": "The emergence of foundation models (FMs) has enabled the development of highly capable and autonomous agents, unlocking new application opportunities across a wide range of domains. Evaluating the architecture of agents is particularly important as the architectural decisions significantly impact the quality attributes of agents given their unique characteristics, including compound architecture, autonomous and non-deterministic behaviour, and continuous evolution. However, these traditional methods fall short in addressing the evaluation needs of agent architecture due to the unique characteristics of these agents. Therefore, in this paper, we present AgentArcEval, a novel agent architecture evaluation method designed specially to address the complexities of FM-based agent architecture and its evaluation. Moreover, we present a catalogue of agent-specific general scenarios, which serves as a guide for generating concrete scenarios to design and evaluate the agent architecture. We demonstrate the usefulness of AgentArcEval and the catalogue through a case study on the architecture evaluation of a real-world tax copilot, named Luna.",

        "summary": "The integration of machine learning (ML) systems into critical industries such as healthcare, finance, and cybersecurity has transformed decision-making processes, but it also brings new challenges around trust, security, and accountability. As AI systems become more ubiquitous, ensuring the transparency and correctness of AI-driven decisions is crucial, especially when they have direct consequences on privacy, security, or fairness. Verifiable AI, powered by Zero-Knowledge Machine Learning (zkML), offers a robust solution to these challenges. zkML enables the verification of AI model inferences without exposing sensitive data, providing an essential layer of trust and privacy. However, traditional zkML systems typically require deep cryptographic expertise, placing them beyond the reach of most ML engineers. In this paper, we introduce JSTprove, a specialized zkML toolkit, built on Polyhedra Network's Expander backend, to enable AI developers and ML engineers to generate and verify proofs of AI inference. JSTprove provides an end-to-end verifiable AI inference pipeline that hides cryptographic complexity behind a simple command-line interface while exposing auditable artifacts for reproducibility. We present the design, innovations, and real-world use cases of JSTprove as well as our blueprints and tooling to encourage community review and extension. JSTprove therefore serves both as a usable zkML product for current engineering needs and as a reproducible foundation for future research and production deployments of verifiable AI.",

Existing machine learning methods often neglect governing physical laws and fail to quantify inherent uncertainties in spatiotemporal predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce a physics-consistent neural operator (PCNO) that enforces physical constraints by projecting surrogate model outputs onto function spaces satisfying predefined laws. A physics-consistent projection layer within PCNO efficiently computes mass and momentum conservation in Fourier space. Building upon deterministic predictions, we further propose a diffusion model-enhanced PCNO (DiffPCNO), which leverages a consistency model to quantify and mitigate uncertainties, thereby improving the accuracy and reliability of forecasts. PCNO and DiffPCNO achieve high-fidelity spatiotemporal predictions while preserving physical consistency and uncertainty across diverse systems and spatial resolutions, ranging from turbulent flow modeling to real-world flood/atmospheric forecasting. Our two-stage framework provides a robust and versatile approach for accurate, physically grounded, and uncertainty-aware spatiotemporal forecasting.",

On average, White (--31pp) and Black (--9pp) workers are underrepresented, while Hispanic (+17pp) and Asian (+12pp) workers are overrepresented. These distortions can be extreme: for example, across all four models, Housekeepers are portrayed as nearly 100\\% Hispanic, while Black workers are erased from many occupations.

The approach uses the Evolutionary Optimization of Neuromorphic Systems (EONS) algorithm to evolve sparse, stateful SNNs by jointly optimizing their architectures and parameters. Inputs are encoded into spike trains, and predictions are made by thresholding a single output neuron's spike counts. We also incorporate simple voting ensemble methods to improve performance and robustness. To evaluate the framework, we apply it with application-specific optimizations to the task of detecting low signal-to-noise ratio radioactive sources in gamma-ray spectral data. The resulting SNNs, with as few as 49 neurons and 66 synapses, achieve a 51.8% true positive rate (TPR) at a false alarm rate of 1/hr, outperforming PCA (42.7%) and deep learning (49.8%) baselines. A three-model any-vote ensemble increases TPR to 67.1% at the same false alarm rate. Hardware deployment on the microCaspian neuromorphic platform demonstrates 2mW power consumption and 20.2ms inference latency. We also demonstrate generalizability by applying the same framework, without domain-specific modification, to seizure detection in EEG recordings. An ensemble achieves 95% TPR with a 16% false positive rate, comparable to recent deep learning approaches with significant reduction in parameter count.",

However, they may underperform in domains with distribution shifts and scarce labels, where supervised fine-tuning may be infeasible. While continued self-supervised learning for model adaptation is common for generative language models, this strategy has not proven effective for vision-centric encoder models. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel formulation of self-supervised fine-tuning for vision foundation models, where the model is adapted to a new domain without requiring annotations, leveraging only short multi-view object-centric videos. Our method is referred to as VESSA: Video-based objEct-centric Self-Supervised Adaptation for visual foundation models. VESSA's training technique is based on a self-distillation paradigm, where it is critical to carefully tune prediction heads and deploy parameter-efficient adaptation techniques - otherwise, the model may quickly forget its pretrained knowledge and reach a degraded state. VESSA benefits significantly from multi-view object observations sourced from different frames in an object-centric video, efficiently learning robustness to varied capture conditions, without the need of annotations. Through comprehensive experiments with 3 vision foundation models on 2 datasets, VESSA demonstrates consistent improvements in downstream classification tasks, compared to the base models and previous adaptation methods.

To verify the effectiveness of the model, a carefully designed comparative experiment was conducted, selecting four representative basic machine learning models: decision tree, random forest, Adaboost, and XGBoost as benchmarks. The detailed experimental results show that the BiGRU Transformer optimization model proposed in this paper exhibits significant advantages in key evaluation indicators: in terms of mean square error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE), the model achieves the lowest value among all comparison models, and its predicted results have the smallest deviation from the actual values; In terms of mean absolute error (MAE) and coefficient of determination (R2) indicators, the model also performs well and the results are balanced and stable, with comprehensive predictive performance far exceeding the benchmark machine learning methods compared. In summary, the Transformer model based on bidirectional gated recurrent unit optimization successfully constructed in this study can efficiently and accurately complete GPU memory demand prediction tasks in deep learning tasks, and its prediction accuracy has been significantly improved compared to traditional machine learning methods. This research provides strong technical support and reliable theoretical basis for optimizing resource scheduling and management of deep learning tasks, and improving the utilization efficiency of computing clusters.",

Post-training quantization (PTQ) can effectively reduce these demands by storing weights in lower bit-width formats.

In this work, we introduce a Grouped Lattice Vector Quantization (GLVQ) framework that assigns each group of weights a customized lattice codebook, defined by a learnable generation matrix. To address the non-differentiability of the quantization process, we adopt Babai rounding to approximate nearest-lattice-point search during training, which enables stable optimization of the generation matrices. Once trained, decoding reduces to a simple matrix-vector multiplication, yielding an efficient and practical quantization pipeline. Experiments on multiple benchmarks show that our approach achieves a better trade-off between model size and accuracy compared to existing post-training quantization baselines, highlighting its effectiveness in deploying large models under stringent resource constraints.

We evaluate parameter-efficient fine-tuned local LLMs for assisting with x86 RE tasks in these settings. Eight open-weight models across the CodeLlama, Qwen2.5-Coder, and CodeGemma series are fine-tuned on a custom curated dataset of 5,981 x86 assembly examples. We evaluate them quantitatively and identify the fine-tuned Qwen2.5-Coder-7B as the top performer, which we name REx86.

This ability is essential for aligning model outputs with the diagnostic workflows clinicians use in practice, enabling trustworthy clinician-AI collaboration. Existing 3D datasets provide localization labels, but none support this \"grounded reasoning\" ability. To address this gap, we introduce 3DReasonKnee, the first 3D grounded reasoning dataset for medical images, which provides 494k high-quality quintuples derived from 7,970 3D knee MRI volumes. Each quintuple includes: (1) the 3D MRI volume, (2) a diagnostic question targeting a specific anatomical region (3) a 3D bounding box localizing the relevant anatomical structures, (4) clinician-generated diagnostic reasoning steps that explicitly detail the 3D reasoning process, and (5) structured severity assessments for the relevant anatomical region. The creation and validation of 3DReasonKnee, involving over 450 hours of expert clinician time for manually segmenting MRIs and generating reasoning chains, ensures its superior quality and clinical relevance. We establish ReasonKnee-Bench to evaluate localization and diagnostic accuracy, providing insight into VLM ability to perform grounding and severity assessment across anatomical regions and diagnostic inquiries. We benchmark five state-of-the-art VLMs, providing baseline performance for ReasonKnee-Bench. By providing this unique resource of expert-annotated 3D reasoning pathways, 3DReasonKnee serves as a repository of orthopedic surgeons' diagnostic expertise and offers a vital testbed for advancing multimodal medical AI systems towards 3D, clinically aligned, localized decision-making capabilities.

        "summary": "Protein mutations can have profound effects on biological function, making accurate prediction of property changes critical for drug discovery, protein engineering, and precision medicine. Current approaches rely on fine-tuning protein-specific transformers for individual datasets, but struggle with cross-dataset generalization due to heterogeneous experimental conditions and limited target domain data. We introduce two key innovations: (1) the first application of Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) to protein mutation property prediction, and (2) a novel mutation encoding strategy using separator tokens to directly incorporate mutations into sequence context. We build upon transformer architectures integrating them with MAML to enable rapid adaptation to new tasks through minimal gradient steps rather than learning dataset-specific patterns. Our mutation encoding addresses the critical limitation where standard transformers treat mutation positions as unknown tokens, significantly degrading performance. Evaluation across three diverse protein mutation datasets (functional fitness, thermal stability, and solubility) demonstrates significant advantages over traditional fine-tuning. In cross-task evaluation, our meta-learning approach achieves 29% better accuracy for functional fitness with 65% less training time, and 94% better accuracy for solubility with 55% faster training. The framework maintains consistent training efficiency regardless of dataset size, making it particularly valuable for industrial applications and early-stage protein design where experimental data is limited. This work establishes a systematic application of meta-learning to protein mutation analysis and introduces an effective mutation encoding strategy, offering transformative methodology for cross-domain generalization in protein engineering.",

        "summary": "Medical image segmentation is essential for clinical applications such as disease diagnosis, treatment planning, and disease development monitoring because it provides precise morphological and spatial information on anatomical structures that directly influence treatment decisions. Convolutional neural networks significantly impact image segmentation; however, since convolution operations are local, capturing global contextual information and long-range dependencies is still challenging. Their capacity to precisely segment structures with complicated borders and a variety of sizes is impacted by this restriction. Since transformers use self-attention methods to capture global context and long-range dependencies efficiently, integrating transformer-based architecture with CNNs is a feasible approach to overcoming these challenges. To address these challenges, we propose the Focal Modulation and Bidirectional Feature Fusion Network for Medical Image Segmentation, referred to as FM-BFF-Net in the remainder of this paper. The network combines convolutional and transformer components, employs a focal modulation attention mechanism to refine context awareness, and introduces a bidirectional feature fusion module that enables efficient interaction between encoder and decoder representations across scales. Through this design, FM-BFF-Net enhances boundary precision and robustness to variations in lesion size, shape, and contrast. Extensive experiments on eight publicly available datasets, including polyp detection, skin lesion segmentation, and ultrasound imaging, show that FM-BFF-Net consistently surpasses recent state-of-the-art methods in Jaccard index and Dice coefficient, confirming its effectiveness and adaptability for diverse medical imaging scenarios.",

        "summary": "Understanding adversarial behavior in cybersecurity has traditionally relied on high-level intelligence reports and manual interpretation of attack chains. However, real-time defense requires the ability to infer attacker intent and cognitive strategy directly from low-level system telemetry such as intrusion detection system (IDS) logs. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to analyze Suricata IDS logs and infer attacker actions in terms of MITRE ATT&CK techniques. Our approach is grounded in the hypothesis that attacker behavior reflects underlying cognitive biases such as loss aversion, risk tolerance, or goal persistence that can be extracted and modeled through careful observation of log sequences. This lays the groundwork for future work on behaviorally adaptive cyber defense and cognitive trait inference. We develop a strategy-driven prompt system to segment large amounts of network logs data into distinct behavioral phases in a highly efficient manner, enabling the LLM to associate each phase with likely techniques and underlying cognitive motives. By mapping network-layer events to high-level attacker strategies, our method reveals how behavioral signals such as tool switching, protocol transitions, or pivot patterns correspond to psychologically meaningful decision points. The results demonstrate that LLMs can bridge the semantic gap between packet-level logs and strategic intent, offering a pathway toward cognitive-adaptive cyber defense.

        "summary": "Aircraft collision avoidance systems is critical to modern aviation. These systems are designed to predict potential collisions between aircraft and recommend appropriate avoidance actions. Creating effective collision avoidance systems requires solutions to a variety of technical challenges related to surveillance, decision making, and validation. These challenges have sparked significant research and development efforts over the past several decades that have resulted in a variety of proposed solutions. This article provides an overview of these challenges and solutions with an emphasis on those that have been put through a rigorous validation process and accepted by regulatory bodies. The challenges posed by the collision avoidance problem are often present in other domains, and aircraft collision avoidance systems can serve as case studies that provide valuable insights for a wide range of safety-critical systems.",

        "summary": "Unified, generalizable semantic control in video generation remains a critical open challenge. Existing methods either introduce artifacts by enforcing inappropriate pixel-wise priors from structure-based controls, or rely on non-generalizable, condition-specific finetuning or task-specific architectures. We introduce Video-As-Prompt (VAP), a new paradigm that reframes this problem as in-context generation. VAP leverages a reference video as a direct semantic prompt, guiding a frozen Video Diffusion Transformer (DiT) via a plug-and-play Mixture-of-Transformers (MoT) expert. This architecture prevents catastrophic forgetting and is guided by a temporally biased position embedding that eliminates spurious mapping priors for robust context retrieval. To power this approach and catalyze future research, we built VAP-Data, the largest dataset for semantic-controlled video generation with over 100K paired videos across 100 semantic conditions. As a single unified model, VAP sets a new state-of-the-art for open-source methods, achieving a 38.7% user preference rate that rivals leading condition-specific commercial models. VAP's strong zero-shot generalization and support for various downstream applications mark a significant advance toward general-purpose, controllable video generation.",

        "summary": "Adapter-based training has emerged as a key mechanism for extending the capabilities of powerful foundation image generators, enabling personalized and stylized text-to-image synthesis. These adapters are typically trained to capture a specific target attribute, such as subject identity, using single-image reconstruction objectives. However, because the input image inevitably contains a mixture of visual factors, adapters are prone to entangle the target attribute with incidental ones, such as pose, expression, and lighting. This spurious correlation problem limits generalization and obstructs the model's ability to adhere to the input text prompt. In this work, we uncover a simple yet effective solution: provide the very shortcuts we wish to eliminate during adapter training. In Shortcut-Rerouted Adapter Training, confounding factors are routed through auxiliary modules, such as ControlNet or LoRA, eliminating the incentive for the adapter to internalize them. The auxiliary modules are then removed during inference. When applied to tasks like facial and full-body identity injection, our approach improves generation quality, diversity, and prompt adherence. These results point to a general design principle in the era of large models: when seeking disentangled representations, the most effective path may be to establish shortcuts for what should NOT be learned.",

However, the introduction of external knowledge bases presents RAG with challenges in long-context processing, significantly increasing memory consumption and inference latency. Existing research accelerates inference by precomputing Key and Value (KV) of the knowledge base and loading them on-demand during inference. Based on the access frequency of different KV chunks within the external knowledge base, this paper proposes a hotness-aware RAG (HA-RAG) inference optimization system. First, leveraging the numerical distribution of KV chunks, we introduce a hotness-aware mixed-precision compressing and loading method to reduce disk I/O and memory access overhead. Second, we design a hotness-aware data placement strategy that prioritizes storing frequently accessed KV chunks in high-speed memory to improve data access efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared with TurboRAG, the proposed HA-RAG achieves an average speedup of 2.10x and maximum speedup of 10.49x in Time-To-First-Token (TTFT) with negligible accuracy loss.",

        "summary": "Multimodal learning systems often encounter challenges related to modality imbalance, where a dominant modality may overshadow others, thereby hindering the learning of weak modalities. Conventional approaches often force weak modalities to align with dominant ones in \"Learning to be (the same)\" (Positive Learning), which risks suppressing the unique information inherent in the weak modalities. To address this challenge, we offer a new learning paradigm: \"Learning Not to be\" (Negative Learning). Instead of enhancing weak modalities' target-class predictions, the dominant modalities dynamically guide the weak modality to suppress non-target classes. This stabilizes the decision space and preserves modality-specific information, allowing weak modalities to preserve unique information without being over-aligned. We proceed to reveal multimodal learning from a robustness perspective and theoretically derive the Multimodal Negative Learning (MNL) framework, which introduces a dynamic guidance mechanism tailored for negative learning. Our method provably tightens the robustness lower bound of multimodal learning by increasing the Unimodal Confidence Margin (UCoM) and reduces the empirical error of weak modalities, particularly under noisy and imbalanced scenarios. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our approach against competing methods.

Existing graph-based spatio-temporal learning approaches rely on predetermined graph topologies--correlation thresholds, sector classifications--that fail to adapt when market dynamics shift across different crisis mechanisms: credit contagion, pandemic shocks, or inflation-driven selloffs. We present CRISP (Crisis-Resilient Investment through Spatio-temporal Patterns), a graph-based spatio-temporal learning framework that encodes spatial relationships via Graph Convolutional Networks and temporal dynamics via BiLSTM with self-attention, then learns sparse structures through multi-head Graph Attention Networks. Unlike fixed-topology methods, CRISP discovers which asset relationships matter through attention mechanisms, filtering 92.5% of connections as noise while preserving crisis-relevant dependencies for accurate regime-specific predictions. Trained on 2005--2021 data encompassing credit and pandemic crises, CRISP demonstrates robust generalization to 2022--2024 inflation-driven markets--a fundamentally different regime--by accurately forecasting regime-appropriate correlation structures. This enables adaptive portfolio allocation that maintains profitability during downturns, achieving Sharpe ratio 3.76: 707% improvement over equal-weight baselines and 94% improvement over static graph methods. Learned attention weights provide interpretable regime detection, with defensive cluster attention strengthening 49% during crises versus 31% market-wide--emergent behavior from learning to forecast rather than imposing assumptions.",

        "summary": "The role of reasoning in Audio Large Language Models remains widely underexplored, as introducing a reasoning process often degrades rather than improves performance during inference, a phenomenon we term test-time inverse scaling, where longer reasoning chains yield progressively worse results. We demonstrate that this stems not from fundamental limitations of reasoning itself, but from inadequate training: models without proper guidance for the reasoning process produce hallucinatory, inconsistent reasoning that accumulates errors over longer chains. To address these challenges, we introduce CESAR (Consistent, Effective, and Scalable Audio Reasoners), shifting from outcome verification to rewarding the reasoning process. Our online reinforcement learning framework employs Group Relative Policy Optimization with a multi-faceted reward suite that incentivizes not only correctness and format but also consistency, structured analytical patterns, causal reasoning, domain-knowledge integration, and calibrated reasoning depth. CESAR resolves test-time inverse scaling, transforming reasoning from detriments into gains while revealing model-specific ``reasoning sweet spots\", where performance peaks during test-time scaling. We achieve state-of-the-art results on MMAU Test-mini, substantially outperforming Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-4o Audio, and near-human-level performance on MMSU reasoning tasks. Through AI-as-judge evaluations and qualitative comparisons, we provide both quantitative and qualitative validation of our improved reasoning quality. Importantly, enhanced reasoning creates synergistic effects, simultaneously improving multimodal reasoning and perception capabilities. Overall, CESAR establishes a principled method for developing robust and scalable reasoning in Audio LLMs.",

Prior work has typically compared systems using a single representational similarity metric, yet each captures only one facet of representational structure. To address this, we leverage a suite of representational similarity metrics-each capturing a distinct facet of representational correspondence, such as geometry, unit-level tuning, or linear decodability-and assess brain region or model separability using multiple complementary measures. Metrics that preserve geometric or tuning structure (e.g., RSA, Soft Matching) yield stronger region-based discrimination, whereas more flexible mappings such as Linear Predictivity show weaker separation. These findings suggest that geometry and tuning encode brain-region- or model-family-specific signatures, while linearly decodable information tends to be more globally shared across regions or models. To integrate these complementary representational facets, we adapt Similarity Network Fusion (SNF), a framework originally developed for multi-omics data integration. SNF produces substantially sharper regional and model family-level separation than any single metric and yields robust composite similarity profiles. Moreover, clustering cortical regions using SNF-derived similarity scores reveals a clearer hierarchical organization that aligns closely with established anatomical and functional hierarchies of the visual cortex-surpassing the correspondence achieved by individual metrics.",

While existing machine learning algorithms can achieve strong accuracy on this task, most models are uninterpretable and cannot justify their conclusions. Absent the ability to understand model reasoning, doctors cannot leverage their expertise to identify incorrect model predictions and intervene accordingly. To improve the human-model interaction, we introduce ProtoEEG-kNN, an inherently interpretable model that follows a simple case-based reasoning process. ProtoEEG-kNN reasons by comparing an EEG to similar EEGs from the training set and visually demonstrates its reasoning both in terms of IED morphology (shape) and spatial distribution (location). We show that ProtoEEG-kNN can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy in IED detection while providing explanations that experts prefer over existing approaches.",

The scientific community is divided between physicalism and natural dualism. Physicalism posits consciousness is a physical process that can be modeled computationally; natural dualism rejects this hypothesis. Finding a computational model has proven elusive, particularly because of conflation of consciousness with other cognitive capabilities exhibited by humans, such as intelligence and physiological sensations. Here we show such a computational model that precisely models consciousness, natural or artificial, identifying the structural and functional mechanisms that effect it, confirming the physicalism hypothesis. We found such a model is obtainable when including the underlying (biological or digital) substrate and accounting for reactive behavior in substrate sub-systems (e.g., autonomous physiological responses). Results show that, unlike all other computational processes, consciousness is not independent of its substrate and possessing it is an evolutionary advantage for intelligent entities. Our result shows there is no impediment to the realization of fully artificial consciousness but, surprisingly, that it is also possible to realize artificial intelligence of arbitrary level without consciousness whatsoever, and that there is no advantage in imbuing artificial systems with consciousness.",

However, these models operate as black boxes, providing no insight into the geometric patterns they learn or the heuristics they employ during tour construction. We address this opacity by applying sparse autoencoders (SAEs), a mechanistic interpretability technique, to a Transformer-based TSP solver, representing the first application of activation-based interpretability methods to operations research models. We train a pointer network with reinforcement learning on 100-node instances, then fit an SAE to the encoder's residual stream to discover an overcomplete dictionary of interpretable features. Our analysis reveals that the solver naturally develops features mirroring fundamental TSP concepts: boundary detectors that activate on convex-hull nodes, cluster-sensitive features responding to locally dense regions, and separator features encoding geometric partitions. These findings provide the first model-internal account of what neural TSP solvers compute before node selection, demonstrate that geometric structure emerges without explicit supervision, and suggest pathways toward transparent hybrid systems that combine neural efficiency with algorithmic interpretability.

For these problems, equivariant networks can help improve modeling across undersampled parts of the input space, and uncertainty estimation can guard against overconfidence. However, until now, the relationships between equivariance and model confidence, and more generally equivariance and model calibration, has yet to be studied. Since traditional classification and regression error terms show up in the definitions of calibration error, it is natural to suspect that previous work can be used to help understand the relationship between equivariance and calibration error. In this work, we present a theory relating equivariance to uncertainty estimation. By proving lower and upper bounds on uncertainty calibration errors (ECE and ENCE) under various equivariance conditions, we elucidate the generalization limits of equivariant models and illustrate how symmetry mismatch can result in miscalibration in both classification and regression. We complement our theoretical framework with numerical experiments that clarify the relationship between equivariance and uncertainty using a variety of real and simulated datasets, and we comment on trends with symmetry mismatch, group size, and aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties.",

Our main contribution is the characterization of the optimal error rate for clustering under PABM, which provides novel insights on clustering hardness: we demonstrate that unlike SBM and DCBM, cluster recovery remains possible in PABM even when traditional edge-density signals vanish, provided intra- and inter-cluster popularity coefficients differ. This highlights a dimension of degree heterogeneity captured by PABM but overlooked by DCBM: local differences in connectivity patterns can enhance cluster separability independently of global edge densities. Finally, because PABM exhibits a richer structure, its expected adjacency matrix has rank between $k$ and $k^2$, where $k$ is the number of clusters. As a result, spectral embeddings based on the top $k$ eigenvectors may fail to capture important structural information. Our numerical experiments on both synthetic and real datasets confirm that spectral clustering algorithms incorporating $k^2$ eigenvectors outperform traditional spectral approaches.",

Current geometric generative models remain computationally expensive at inference -- requiring many steps of complex numerical simulation -- as they are derived from dynamical measure transport frameworks such as diffusion and flow-matching on Riemannian manifolds. In this paper, we propose Generalised Flow Maps (GFM), a new class of few-step generative models that generalises the Flow Map framework in Euclidean spaces to arbitrary Riemannian manifolds. We instantiate GFMs with three self-distillation-based training methods: Generalised Lagrangian Flow Maps, Generalised Eulerian Flow Maps, and Generalised Progressive Flow Maps. We theoretically show that GFMs, under specific design decisions, unify and elevate existing Euclidean few-step generative models, such as consistency models, shortcut models, and meanflows, to the Riemannian setting. We benchmark GFMs against other geometric generative models on a suite of geometric datasets, including geospatial data, RNA torsion angles, and hyperbolic manifolds, and achieve state-of-the-art sample quality for single- and few-step evaluations, and superior or competitive log-likelihoods using the implicit probability flow.",

In this work, we analyze the problem of computing SHAP explanations for *Tensor Networks (TNs)*, a broader and more expressive class of models than those for which current exact SHAP algorithms are known to hold, and which is widely used for neural network abstraction and compression. First, we introduce a general framework for computing provably exact SHAP explanations for general TNs with arbitrary structures. Interestingly, we show that, when TNs are restricted to a *Tensor Train (TT)* structure, SHAP computation can be performed in *poly-logarithmic* time using *parallel* computation. Thanks to the expressiveness power of TTs, this complexity result can be generalized to many other popular ML models such as decision trees, tree ensembles, linear models, and linear RNNs, therefore tightening previously reported complexity results for these families of models. Finally, by leveraging reductions of binarized neural networks to Tensor Network representations, we demonstrate that SHAP computation can become *efficiently tractable* when the network's *width* is fixed, while it remains computationally hard even with constant *depth*. This highlights an important insight: for this class of models, width - rather than depth - emerges as the primary computational bottleneck in SHAP computation.",

These pairs are typically generated via traditional numerical methods, which need thousands of time steps iterations far more than the dozens required for training, creating heavy computational and temporal overheads. To address these challenges, we propose a novel data generation algorithm, called HOmologous Perturbation in Solution Space (HOPSS), which directly generates training datasets with fewer time steps rather than following the traditional approach of generating large time steps datasets. This algorithm simultaneously accelerates dataset generation and preserves the approximate precision required for model training. Specifically, we first obtain a set of base solution functions from a reliable solver, usually with thousands of time steps, and then align them in time steps with training datasets by downsampling. Subsequently, we propose a \"homologous perturbation\" approach: by combining two solution functions (one as the primary function, the other as a homologous perturbation term scaled by a small scalar) with random noise, we efficiently generate comparable-precision PDE data points. Finally, using these data points, we compute the variation in the original equation's RHS to form new solution pairs. Theoretical and experimental results show HOPSS lowers time complexity. For example, on the Navier-Stokes equation, it generates 10,000 samples in approximately 10% of traditional methods' time, with comparable model training performance.",

While successful in language and vision, their adoption in EEG has lagged due to the heterogeneity of public datasets, which are collected under varying protocols, devices, and electrode configurations. Existing EEG foundation models struggle to generalize across these variations, often restricting pretraining to a single setup, resulting in suboptimal performance, in particular under linear probing. We present REVE (Representation for EEG with Versatile Embeddings), a pretrained model explicitly designed to generalize across diverse EEG signals. REVE introduces a novel 4D positional encoding scheme that enables it to process signals of arbitrary length and electrode arrangement. Using a masked autoencoding objective, we pretrain REVE on over 60,000 hours of EEG data from 92 datasets spanning 25,000 subjects, representing the largest EEG pretraining effort to date. REVE achieves state-of-the-art results on 10 downstream EEG tasks, including motor imagery classification, seizure detection, sleep staging, cognitive load estimation, and emotion recognition. With little to no fine-tuning, it demonstrates strong generalization, and nuanced spatio-temporal modeling.

We focus on the challenge of characterizing the semantic content of the hidden representations with unsupervised learning tools, partially developed by us and described in this thesis, which allow harnessing the low-dimensional structure of the data. Chapter 2. introduces Gride, a method that allows estimating the intrinsic dimension of the data as an explicit function of the scale without performing any decimation of the data set. Our approach is based on rigorous distributional results that enable the quantification of uncertainty of the estimates. Moreover, our method is simple and computationally efficient since it relies only on the distances among nearest data points. In Chapter 3, we study the evolution of the probability density across the hidden layers in some state-of-the-art deep neural networks. We find that the initial layers generate a unimodal probability density getting rid of any structure irrelevant to classification. In subsequent layers, density peaks arise in a hierarchical fashion that mirrors the semantic hierarchy of the concepts. This process leaves a footprint in the probability density of the output layer, where the topography of the peaks allows reconstructing the semantic relationships of the categories. In Chapter 4, we study the problem of generalization in deep neural networks: adding parameters to a network that interpolates its training data will typically improve its generalization performance, at odds with the classical bias-variance trade-off. We show that wide neural networks learn redundant representations instead of overfitting to spurious correlation and that redundant neurons appear only if the network is regularized and the training error is zero.",

However, fully realizing the potential of SAGIN-MEC in the LAE presents significant challenges, including coordinating decisions across heterogeneous nodes with different roles, modeling complex factors such as mobility and network variability, and handling real-time decision-making under partially observable environment with hybrid variables. To address these challenges, we first present a hierarchical SAGIN-MEC architecture that enables the coordination between user devices (UDs), uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs), and satellites. Then, we formulate a UD cost minimization optimization problem (UCMOP) to minimize the UD cost by jointly optimizing the task offloading ratio, UAV trajectory planning, computing resource allocation, and UD association. We show that the UCMOP is an NP-hard problem. To overcome this challenge, we propose a multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG)-convex optimization and coalitional game (MADDPG-COCG) algorithm. Specifically, we employ the MADDPG algorithm to optimize the continuous temporal decisions for heterogeneous nodes in the partially observable SAGIN-MEC system. Moreover, we propose a convex optimization and coalitional game (COCG) method to enhance the conventional MADDPG by deterministically handling the hybrid and varying-dimensional decisions. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MADDPG-COCG algorithm significantly enhances the user-centric performances in terms of the aggregated UD cost, task completion delay, and UD energy consumption, with a slight increase in UAV energy consumption, compared to the benchmark algorithms. Moreover, the MADDPG-COCG algorithm shows superior convergence stability and scalability.",

We formulate the revision similarity problem to unify a wide range of machine learning evaluation problems whose goal is to assess a revision to an existing document. We observe that revisions usually change only a small portion of an existing document, so the existing document and its immediate revisions share a majority of their content. We formulate five adequacy criteria for revision similarity measures, designed to align them with human judgement. We show that popular pairwise measures, like BLEU, fail to meet these criteria, because their scores are dominated by the shared content. They report high similarity between two revisions when humans would assess them as quite different. This is a fundamental flaw we address. We propose a novel static measure, Excision Score (ES), which computes longest common subsequence (LCS) to remove content shared by an existing document with the ground truth and predicted revisions, before comparing only the remaining divergent regions. This is analogous to a surgeon creating a sterile field to focus on the work area. We use approximation to speed the standard cubic LCS computation to quadratic. In code-editing evaluation, where static measures are often used as a cheap proxy for passing tests, we demonstrate that ES surpasses existing measures. When aligned with test execution on HumanEvalFix, ES improves over its nearest competitor, SARI, by 12% Pearson correlation and by >21% over standard measures like BLEU. The key criterion is invariance to shared context; when we perturb HumanEvalFix with increased shared context, ES' improvement over SARI increases to 20% and >30% over standard measures. ES also handles other corner cases that other measures do not, such as correctly aligning moved code blocks, and appropriately rewarding matching insertions or deletions.",

Due to the inherent constraints of weak supervision, where only video-level labels are provided despite the need for frame-level predictions, traditional adversarial defense mechanisms, such as adversarial training, are not effective since video-level adversarial perturbations are typically weak and inadequate. To address this limitation, pseudo-labels generated directly from the model can enable frame-level adversarial training; however, these pseudo-labels are inherently noisy, significantly degrading performance. We therefore introduce a novel Pseudo-Anomaly Generation method called Spatiotemporal Region Distortion (SRD), which creates synthetic anomalies by applying severe augmentations to localized regions in normal videos while preserving temporal consistency. Integrating these precisely annotated synthetic anomalies with the noisy pseudo-labels substantially reduces label noise, enabling effective adversarial training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the robustness of WSVAD models against adversarial attacks, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by an average of 71.0\\% in overall AUROC performance across multiple benchmarks.

This makes them useful detectors to identify misbehavior. Furthermore, they are also valuable training signals, since they not only reward outputs, but also good internal processes for arriving at that output. However, training against interpretability tools raises a fundamental concern: when a monitor becomes a training target, it may cease to be reliable (Goodhart's Law). We propose two methods for training against probes based on Supervised Fine-tuning and Direct Preference Optimization. We conduct an initial exploration of these methods in a testbed for reducing toxicity and evaluate the amount by which probe accuracy drops when training against them. To retain the accuracy of probe-detectors after training, we attempt (1) to train against an ensemble of probes, (2) retain held-out probes that aren't used for training, and (3) retrain new probes after training. First, probe-based preference optimization unexpectedly preserves probe detectability better than classifier-based methods, suggesting the preference learning objective incentivizes maintaining rather than obfuscating relevant representations. Second, probe diversity provides minimal practical benefit - simply retraining probes after optimization recovers high detection accuracy. Our findings suggest probe-based training can be viable for certain alignment methods, though probe ensembles are largely unnecessary when retraining is feasible.",

Although drones provide a flexible and effective tool for PDRA, routing them in large-scale networks remains challenging. Traditional optimization methods scale poorly and demand domain expertise, while existing deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approaches adopt a single-task paradigm, requiring separate models for each problem variant and lacking adaptability to evolving operational needs. This study proposes a unified model (UM) for drone routing that simultaneously addresses eight PDRA variants. By training a single neural network across multiple problem configurations, UM captures shared structural knowledge while adapting to variant-specific constraints through a modern transformer encoder-decoder architecture. A lightweight adapter mechanism further enables efficient finetuning to unseen attributes without retraining, enhancing deployment flexibility in dynamic disaster scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the UM reduces training time and parameters by a factor of eight compared with training separate models, while consistently outperforming single-task DRL methods by 6--14\\% and traditional optimization approaches by 24--82\\% in terms of solution quality (total collected information value). The model achieves real-time solutions (1--10 seconds) across networks of up to 1,000 nodes, with robustness confirmed through sensitivity analyses. Moreover, finetuning experiments show that unseen attributes can be effectively incorporated with minimal cost while retaining high solution quality. The proposed UM advances neural combinatorial optimization for time-critical applications, offering a computationally efficient, high-quality, and adaptable solution for drone-based PDRA.",

We work on the space created by the mean vectors of the collection of distributions. For each distribution, the mean vector records the expected value in each coordinate. We show that separability of the mean vectors is a sufficient condition for $UME-$ learnability. However, we show that separability of the mean vectors is not necessary for $UME-$ learnability by constructing a collection of distributions whose mean vectors are non-separable yet $UME-$ learnable using techniques fundamentally different from those used in our separability-based analysis.

While existing research has largely focused on classification tasks in vision domains, the regression-based forecasting setting prevalent in IoT and edge applications remains underexplored. In this paper, we present the first benchmarking framework tailored to investigate CF in federated continual time series forecasting. Using the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality dataset across 12 decentralized clients, we systematically evaluate several CF mitigation strategies, including Replay, Elastic Weight Consolidation, Learning without Forgetting, and Synaptic Intelligence. Key contributions include: (i) introducing a new benchmark for CF in time series FL, (ii) conducting a comprehensive comparative analysis of state-of-the-art methods, and (iii) releasing a reproducible open-source framework. This work provides essential tools and insights for advancing continual learning in federated time-series forecasting systems.",

Built upon a unified formulation of linearized HNNs, ZEN introduces a tractable closed-form solution for the weight matrix and a redundancy-aware propagation scheme to avoid iterative training and to eliminate redundant self information. On 11 real-world hypergraph benchmarks, ZEN consistently outperforms eight baseline models in classification accuracy while achieving up to 696x speedups over the fastest competitor.

Existing causal machine learning approaches usually assume a known exposure mapping that summarizes how the outcome of a given instance is influenced by others' treatment, a simplification that is often unrealistic. Furthermore, the interaction between homophily -- the tendency of similar instances to connect -- and the treatment assignment mechanism can induce a network-level covariate shift that may lead to inaccurate treatment effect estimates, a phenomenon that has not yet been explicitly studied. To address these challenges, we propose HINet, a novel method that integrates graph neural networks with domain adversarial training. This combination allows estimating treatment effects under unknown exposure mappings while mitigating the impact of (network-level) covariate shift. An extensive empirical evaluation on synthetic and semi-synthetic network datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of our approach.",

For this reason we try to predict what photo a user would take of an item, because that image is the argument that can best convince her of the qualities of the item. In this sense, an RS can explain its results and, therefore, increase its reliability. Furthermore, once we have a model to predict attractive images for users, we can estimate their distribution. Thus, the companies acquire a vivid knowledge about the aspects that the clients highlight of their products. The paper includes a formal framework that estimates the authorship probability for a given pair (user, photo). To illustrate the proposal, we use data gathered from TripAdvisor containing the reviews (with photos) of restaurants in six cities of different sizes.",

This has led to the dominance of parallelizable architectures like Transformers and, more recently, State Space Models (SSMs).

To address this, we present ParaRNN, a framework that breaks the sequence-parallelization barrier for nonlinear RNNs. Building on prior work, we cast the sequence of nonlinear recurrence relationships as a single system of equations, which we solve in parallel using Newton's iterations combined with custom parallel reductions. Our implementation achieves speedups of up to 665x over naive sequential application, allowing training nonlinear RNNs at unprecedented scales. To showcase this, we apply ParaRNN to adaptations of LSTM and GRU architectures, successfully training models of 7B parameters that attain perplexity comparable to similarly-sized Transformers and Mamba2 architectures. To accelerate research in efficient sequence modeling, we release the ParaRNN codebase as an open-source framework for automatic training-parallelization of nonlinear RNNs, enabling researchers and practitioners to explore new nonlinear RNN models at scale.",

To address this, we propose a Unified Token Representation (UTR) that merges return-to-go, state, and action into a single token, substantially reducing sequence length and model complexity. Theoretical analysis shows that UTR leads to a tighter Rademacher complexity bound, suggesting improved generalization. We further develop two variants: UDT and UDC, built upon transformer and gated CNN backbones, respectively. Both achieve comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art methods with markedly lower computation. These findings demonstrate that UTR generalizes well across architectures and may provide an efficient foundation for scalable control in future large decision models.",

Each agent first learns a sparse local causal mask that provably identifies the minimal neighborhood variables influencing its dynamics, yielding exponentially tight approximately compact representations (ACRs) of state and domain factors. These ACRs bound the error of truncating value functions to $\\kappa$-hop neighborhoods, enabling efficient learning on graphs. A meta actor-critic then trains a shared policy across multiple source domains while conditioning on the compact domain factors; at test time, a few trajectories suffice to estimate the new domain factor and deploy the adapted policy. We establish finite-sample guarantees on causal recovery, actor-critic convergence, and adaptation gap, and show that GSAC adapts rapidly and significantly outperforms learning-from-scratch and conventional adaptation baselines.",

Recent years have seen the applications of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to solving Stefan problems, yet they still exhibit shortcomings in hyperparameter dependency, training efficiency, and prediction accuracy. To address this, this paper develops a physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM), a rapid physics-informed learning method framework for inverse Stefan problems. PIELM replaces conventional deep neural networks with an extreme learning machine network. The input weights are fixed in the PIELM framework, and the output weights are determined by optimizing a loss vector of physical laws composed by initial and boundary conditions and governing partial differential equations (PDEs). Then, solving inverse Stefan problems is transformed into finding the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse by the least squares method. Case studies show that the PIELM can increase the prediction accuracy by 3-7 order of magnitude in terms of the relative L2 error, and meanwhile saving more than 94% training time, compared to conventional PINNs.",

Traditional diffusion-based approaches require training a model on a clean dataset to learn to reverse the forward noising process. This model is then used to sample clean solutions -- corresponding to posterior sampling from a Bayesian perspective -- that are consistent with the observed data under a specific task. In contrast, self-diffusion introduces a self-contained iterative process that alternates between noising and denoising steps to progressively refine its estimate of the solution. At each step of self-diffusion, noise is added to the current estimate, and a self-denoiser, which is a single untrained convolutional network randomly initialized from scratch, is continuously trained for certain iterations via a data fidelity loss to predict the solution from the noisy estimate. Essentially, self-diffusion exploits the spectral bias of neural networks and modulates it through a scheduled noise process. Without relying on pretrained score functions or external denoisers, this approach still remains adaptive to arbitrary forward operators and noisy observations, making it highly flexible and broadly applicable. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of linear inverse problems, showing that self-diffusion achieves competitive or superior performance compared to other methods.",

        "summary": "Recent disentangled representation learning (DRL) methods heavily rely on factor specific strategies-either learning objectives for attributes or model architectures for objects-to embed inductive biases. Such divergent approaches result in significant overhead when novel factors of variation do not align with prior assumptions, such as statistical independence or spatial exclusivity, or when multiple factors coexist, as practitioners must redesign architectures or objectives. To address this, we propose a compositional bias, a modular inductive bias decoupled from both objectives and architectures. Our key insight is that different factors obey distinct recombination rules in the data distribution: global attributes are mutually exclusive, e.g., a face has one nose, while objects share a common support (any subset of objects can co-exist). We therefore randomly remix latents according to factor-specific rules, i.e., a mixing strategy, and force the encoder to discover whichever factor structure the mixing strategy reflects through two complementary objectives: (i) a prior loss that ensures every remix decodes into a realistic image, and (ii) the compositional consistency loss introduced by Wiedemer et al. (arXiv:2310.05327), which aligns each composite image with its corresponding composite latent. Under this general framework, simply adjusting the mixing strategy enables disentanglement of attributes, objects, and even both, without modifying the objectives or architectures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method shows competitive performance in both attribute and object disentanglement, and uniquely achieves joint disentanglement of global style and objects.

Motivated by this scenario, we introduce \\emph{utility} in the freeze-thaw framework, a function describing the trade-off between the cost and performance that can be estimated from the user's preference data. This utility function, combined with our novel acquisition function and stopping criterion, allows us to dynamically continue training the configuration that we expect to maximally improve the utility in the future, and also automatically stop the HPO process around the maximum utility. Further, we improve the sample efficiency of existing freeze-thaw methods with transfer learning to develop a specialized surrogate model for the cost-sensitive HPO problem. We validate our algorithm on established multi-fidelity HPO benchmarks and show that it outperforms all the previous freeze-thaw BO and transfer-BO baselines we consider, while achieving a significantly better trade-off between the cost and performance.

Problems impeding the practical applications of CIL methods are twofold: (1) non-i.i.d batch streams and no boundary prompts to update, known as the harsher online task-free CIL (OTCIL) scenario; (2) CIL methods suffer from memory loss in learning long task streams, as shown in Fig. 1 (a). To achieve efficient decision-making and decrease cumulative regrets during the OTCIL process, a randomized neural network (Randomized NN) with forward regularization (-F) is proposed to resist forgetting and enhance learning performance. This general framework integrates unsupervised knowledge into recursive convex optimization, has no learning dissipation, and can outperform the canonical ridge style (-R) in OTCIL. Based on this framework, we derive the algorithm of the ensemble deep random vector functional link network (edRVFL) with adjustable forward regularization (-kF), where k mediates the intensity of the intervention. edRVFL-kF generates one-pass closed-form incremental updates and variable learning rates, effectively avoiding past replay and catastrophic forgetting while achieving superior performance. Moreover, to curb unstable penalties caused by non-i.i.d and mitigate intractable tuning of -kF in OTCIL, we improve it to the plug-and-play edRVFL-kF-Bayes, enabling all hard ks in multiple sub-learners to be self-adaptively determined based on Bayesian learning. Experiments were conducted on 2 image datasets including 6 metrics, dynamic performance, ablation tests, and compatibility, which distinctly validates the efficacy of our OTCIL frameworks with -kF-Bayes and -kF styles.",

These conventional metrics often fail to address fairness among agents receiving rewards, particularly in settings where rewards are distributed across a population, such as patients in clinical trials. To address this, a recent body of work has introduced Nash regret, which evaluates performance via the geometric mean of accumulated rewards, aligning with the Nash social welfare function known for satisfying fairness axioms. To minimize Nash regret, existing approaches require specialized algorithm designs and strong assumptions, such as multiplicative concentration inequalities and bounded, non-negative rewards, making them unsuitable for even Gaussian reward distributions. We demonstrate that an initial uniform exploration phase followed by a standard Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm achieves near-optimal Nash regret, while relying only on additive Hoeffding bounds, and naturally extending to sub-Gaussian rewards. Furthermore, we generalize the algorithm to a broad class of fairness metrics called the $p$-mean regret, proving (nearly) optimal regret bounds uniformly across all $p$ values. This is in contrast to prior work, which made extremely restrictive assumptions on the bandit instances and even then achieved suboptimal regret bounds.",

Our analysis yields a seemingly counterintuitive finding: neighbouring datasets with greater inter-class distribution overlap exhibit lower multiplicity. This reversal of conventional expectations arises from a shared Rashomon parameter, and we substantiate it with rigorous proofs.

For each, we establish natural extensions of the neighbouring datasets perspective, conduct the first systematic study of multiplicity in existing algorithms, and finally, propose novel multiplicity-aware methods, namely, multiplicity-aware data acquisition strategies for active learning and multiplicity-aware data imputation techniques.",

        "summary": "Real-world data is frequently noisy and ambiguous. In crowdsourcing, for example, human annotators may assign conflicting class labels to the same instances. Partial-label learning (PLL) addresses this challenge by training classifiers when each instance is associated with a set of candidate labels, only one of which is correct. While early PLL methods approximate the true label posterior, they are often computationally intensive. Recent deep learning approaches improve scalability but rely on surrogate losses and heuristic label refinement. We introduce a novel probabilistic framework that directly approximates the posterior distribution over true labels using amortized variational inference. Our method employs neural networks to predict variational parameters from input data, enabling efficient inference. This approach combines the expressiveness of deep learning with the rigor of probabilistic modeling, while remaining architecture-agnostic. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and efficiency.",

To address this challenge, we propose EPHAD, a simple yet effective test-time adaptation framework that updates the outputs of AD models trained on contaminated datasets using evidence gathered at test time. Our approach integrates the prior knowledge captured by the AD model trained on contaminated datasets with evidence derived from multimodal foundation models like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), classical AD methods like the Latent Outlier Factor or domain-specific knowledge. We illustrate the intuition behind EPHAD using a synthetic toy example and validate its effectiveness through comprehensive experiments across eight visual AD datasets, twenty-six tabular AD datasets, and a real-world industrial AD dataset. Additionally, we conduct an ablation study to analyse hyperparameter influence and robustness to varying contamination levels, demonstrating the versatility and robustness of EPHAD across diverse AD models and evidence pairs.

Therefore, it may seem natural to hypothesize that obtaining meaningful explanations for GAMs could be performed efficiently and would not be computationally infeasible. In this work, we challenge this hypothesis by analyzing the *computational complexity* of generating different explanations for various forms of GAMs across multiple contexts. Our analysis reveals a surprisingly diverse landscape of both positive and negative complexity outcomes. Particularly, under standard complexity assumptions such as P!=NP, we establish several key findings: (1) in stark contrast to many other common ML models, the complexity of generating explanations for GAMs is heavily influenced by the structure of the input space; (2) the complexity of explaining GAMs varies significantly with the types of component models used - but interestingly, these differences only emerge under specific input domain settings; (3) significant complexity distinctions appear for obtaining explanations in regression tasks versus classification tasks in GAMs; and (4) expressing complex models like neural networks additively (e.g., as neural additive models) can make them easier to explain, though interestingly, this benefit appears only for certain explanation methods and input domains. Collectively, these results shed light on the feasibility of computing diverse explanations for GAMs, offering a rigorous theoretical picture of the conditions under which such computations are possible or provably hard.",

Existing data selection methods, including coreset construction, data Shapley values, and influence functions, suffer from critical limitations: they oversimplify nonlinear transformations, ignore informative intermediate representations in hidden layers, or fail to scale to larger MLPs due to high computational complexity. In response, we propose DVC (Data Value Contribution), a novel budget-aware method for evaluating and selecting data for MLP training that accounts for the dynamic evolution of network parameters during training. The DVC method decomposes data contribution into Layer Value Contribution (LVC) and Global Value Contribution (GVC), employing six carefully designed metrics and corresponding efficient algorithms to capture data characteristics across three dimensions--quality, relevance, and distributional diversity--at different granularities. DVC integrates these assessments with an Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) algorithm for adaptive source selection that balances exploration and exploitation. Extensive experiments across six datasets and eight baselines demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms existing approaches under various budget constraints, achieving superior accuracy and F1 scores.

        "summary": "In recent advancements in Test Time Adaptation (TTA), most existing methodologies focus on updating normalization layers to adapt to the test domain. However, the reliance on normalization-based adaptation presents key challenges. First, normalization layers such as Batch Normalization (BN) are highly sensitive to small batch sizes, leading to unstable and inaccurate statistics. Moreover, normalization-based adaptation is inherently constrained by the structure of the pre-trained model, as it relies on training-time statistics that may not generalize well to unseen domains. These issues limit the effectiveness of normalization-based TTA approaches, especially under significant domain shift. In this paper, we introduce a novel paradigm based on the concept of a Buffer layer, which addresses the fundamental limitations of normalization layer updates. Unlike existing methods that modify the core parameters of the model, our approach preserves the integrity of the pre-trained backbone, inherently mitigating the risk of catastrophic forgetting during online adaptation. Through comprehensive experimentation, we demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms traditional methods in mitigating domain shift and enhancing model robustness, but also exhibits strong resilience to forgetting. Furthermore, our Buffer layer is modular and can be seamlessly integrated into nearly all existing TTA frameworks, resulting in consistent performance improvements across various architectures. These findings validate the effectiveness and versatility of the proposed solution in real-world domain adaptation scenarios. The code is available at https://github.com/hyeongyu-kim/Buffer_TTA.",

In this paper, we discover a new phenomenon termed over-aggregating. Over-aggregating arises when a large volume of messages is aggregated into a single node with less discrimination, leading to the dilution of the key messages and potential information loss. To address this, we propose Wideformer, a plug-and-play method for graph attention. Wideformer divides the aggregation of all nodes into parallel processes and guides the model to focus on specific subsets of these processes. The division can limit the input volume per aggregation, avoiding message dilution and reducing information loss. The guiding step sorts and weights the aggregation outputs, prioritizing the informative messages. Evaluations show that Wideformer can effectively mitigate over-aggregating. As a result, the backbone methods can focus on the informative messages, achieving superior performance compared to baseline methods.",

While this concept is well-studied in multi-armed bandits and ergodic tabular Markov decision processes, constructing such instances remains an open question in the general case. In this paper, we formalize this problem for neural network world models as a constrained optimization: finding a modified model that is statistically close to the reference one, while producing divergent performance between optimal and suboptimal policies. We propose an adversarial training procedure to solve this problem and conduct an empirical study across world models of varying quality.

We address this problem by proposing a general framework constraining each flow step to be sampled from a known physical distribution. Flow trajectories are mapped to (and constrained to traverse) the equilibrium states of the simulated physical process. We implement this approach through the 2D Ising model in such a way that flow steps become thermal equilibrium points along a parametric cooling schedule. Our proposed architecture includes an encoder that maps discrete Ising configurations into a continuous latent space, a flow-matching network that performs temperature-driven diffusion, and a projector that returns to discrete Ising states while preserving physical constraints. We validate this framework across multiple lattice sizes, showing that it preserves physical fidelity while outperforming Monte Carlo generation in speed as the lattice size increases. In contrast with standard flow matching, each vector field represents a meaningful stepwise transition in the 2D Ising model's latent space. This demonstrates that embedding physical semantics into generative flows transforms opaque neural trajectories into interpretable physical processes.",

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel second-order surrogate loss based on the pairwise hinge loss, and develop an efficient online algorithm. Unlike conventional approaches that approximate each individual pairwise 0/1 loss term with an instance-wise surrogate function, our approach introduces a new paradigm that directly substitutes the entire aggregated pairwise loss with a surrogate loss function constructed from the first- and second-order statistics of the training data. Theoretically, while existing online AUC optimization algorithms typically achieve an $\\mathcal{O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret bound, our method attains a tighter $\\mathcal{O}(\\ln T)$ bound.

Despite some previous research on this topic, such dataset has been lacking so far. We fill in this gap by presenting GenReview, the hitherto largest dataset containing LLM-written reviews. Our dataset includes 81K reviews generated for all submissions to the 2018--2025 editions of the ICLR by providing the LLM with three independent prompts: a negative, a positive, and a neutral one. GenReview is also linked to the respective papers and their original reviews, thereby enabling a broad range of investigations. To illustrate the value of GenReview, we explore a sample of intriguing research questions, namely: if LLMs exhibit bias in reviewing (they do); if LLM-written reviews can be automatically detected (so far, they can); if LLMs can rigorously follow reviewing instructions (not always) and whether LLM-provided ratings align with decisions on paper acceptance or rejection (holds true only for accepted papers). GenReview can be accessed at the following link: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/gen_review.",

        "summary": "We study a bilevel \\emph{max-max} optimization framework for principal-agent contract design, in which a principal chooses incentives to maximize utility while anticipating the agent's best response. This problem, central to moral hazard and contract theory, underlies applications ranging from market design to delegated portfolio management, hedge fund fee structures, and executive compensation. While linear-quadratic models such as Holmstr\"om-Milgrom admit closed-form solutions, realistic environments with nonlinear utilities, stochastic dynamics, or high-dimensional actions generally do not. We introduce a generic algorithmic framework that removes this reliance on closed forms. Our method adapts modern machine learning techniques for bilevel optimization -- using implicit differentiation with conjugate gradients (CG) -- to compute hypergradients efficiently through Hessian-vector products, without ever forming or inverting Hessians. In benchmark CARA-Normal (Constant Absolute Risk Aversion with Gaussian distribution of uncertainty) environments, the approach recovers known analytical optima and converges reliably from random initialization. More broadly, because it is matrix-free, variance-reduced, and problem-agnostic, the framework extends naturally to complex nonlinear contracts where closed-form solutions are unavailable, such as sigmoidal wage schedules (logistic pay), relative-performance/tournament compensation with common shocks, multi-task contracts with vector actions and heterogeneous noise, and CARA-Poisson count models with $\\mathbb{E}[X\\mid a]=e^{a}$. This provides a new computational tool for contract design, enabling systematic study of models that have remained analytically intractable.",

Those data have some particularities such as high volume and dimensionality, the frequent existence of missing values in some stations, and the high correlation between collected variables. In this regard, it is crucial to make use of Big Data and Data Mining techniques to deal with those data and extract useful knowledge from them that can be used, for instance, to predict weather phenomena. In this paper, we propose a visual big data system that is designed to deal with high amounts of weather-related data and lets the user analyze those data to perform predictive tasks over the considered variables (temperature and rainfall). The proposed system collects open data and loads them onto a local NoSQL database fusing them at different levels of temporal and spatial aggregation in order to perform a predictive analysis using univariate and multivariate approaches as well as forecasting based on training data from neighbor stations in cases with high rates of missing values. The system has been assessed in terms of usability and predictive performance, obtaining an overall normalized mean squared error value of 0.00013, and an overall directional symmetry value of nearly 0.84. Our system has been rated positively by a group of experts in the area (all aspects of the system except graphic desing were rated 3 or above in a 1-5 scale). The promising preliminary results obtained demonstrate the validity of our system and invite us to keep working on this area.",

Extending this framework, we derive an analogous matrix factorization interpretation for fuzzy c-means clustering, which to the best of our knowledge has not been previously formalized. These reformulations allow both clustering paradigms to be expressed as optimization problems over factor matrices, thereby enabling principled extensions to robust variants. To address sensitivity to outliers, we propose robust formulations for both crisp and fuzzy clustering by replacing the Frobenius norm with the l1,2-norm, which penalizes the sum of Euclidean norms across residual columns. We develop alternating minimization algorithms for the standard formulations and IRLS-based algorithms for the robust counterparts.

The primary optimization objective is the minimization of the workflow makespan. Experiments results validate our approach, demonstrating increasingly superior performance over baselines as workflow complexity rises.

While existing centralized photovoltaic (CPV) methods are able to precisely model output dependencies due to uniformity, it is difficult to apply such techniques to DPV systems, as DPVs face challenges such as missing grid-level data, temporal shifts in installed capacity, geographic variability, and panel diversity. SolarBoost overcomes these challenges by modeling aggregated power output as a composite of output from small grids, where each grid output is modeled using a unit output function multiplied by its capacity. This approach decouples the homogeneous unit output function from dynamic capacity for accurate prediction. Efficient algorithms over an upper-bound approximation are proposed to overcome computational bottlenecks in loss functions. We demonstrate the superiority of grid-level modeling via theoretical analysis and experiments. SolarBoost has been validated through deployment across various cities in China, significantly reducing potential losses and provides valuable insights for the operation of power grids.

Our method frames the problem as a continuous relaxation of traditional variable selection using a noising mechanism, without requiring backpropagation through model training processes.

However, gradient sharing still risks privacy leakage, such as gradient inversion attacks. Homomorphic Encryption (HE) can secure aggregation but often incurs prohibitive computational and communication overhead. Existing HE-based FL methods sit at two extremes: encrypting all gradients for full privacy at high cost, or partially encrypting gradients to save resources while exposing vulnerabilities. We present DictPFL, a practical framework that achieves full gradient protection with minimal overhead. DictPFL encrypts every transmitted gradient while keeping non-transmitted parameters local, preserving privacy without heavy computation. It introduces two key modules: Decompose-for-Partial-Encrypt (DePE), which decomposes model weights into a static dictionary and an updatable lookup table, only the latter is encrypted and aggregated, while the static dictionary remains local and requires neither sharing nor encryption; and Prune-for-Minimum-Encrypt (PrME), which applies encryption-aware pruning to minimize encrypted parameters via consistent, history-guided masks. Experiments show that DictPFL reduces communication cost by 402-748$\\times$ and accelerates training by 28-65$\\times$ compared to fully encrypted FL, while outperforming state-of-the-art selective encryption methods by 51-155$\\times$ in overhead and 4-19$\\times$ in speed. Remarkably, DictPFL's runtime is within 2$\\times$ of plaintext FL, demonstrating for the first time, that HE-based private federated learning is practical for real-world deployment.

On the other hand, their unified memory architecture and narrower gap between CPU and GPU performance provide an opportunity to reduce inference latency by assigning tasks to both CPU and GPU. The main obstacles for such collaborative execution are the significant synchronization overhead required to combine partial results, and the difficulty of predicting execution times of tasks assigned to CPU and GPU (due to the dynamic selection of implementations and parallelism level). To overcome these obstacles, we propose both a lightweight synchronization mechanism based on OpenCL fine-grained shared virtual memory (SVM) and machine learning models to accurately predict execution times. Notably, these models capture the performance characteristics of GPU kernels and account for their dispatch times. A comprehensive evaluation on four mobile platforms shows that our approach can quickly select CPU-GPU co-execution strategies achieving up to 1.89x speedup for linear layers and 1.75x speedup for convolutional layers (close to the achievable maximum values of 2.01x and 1.87x, respectively, found by exhaustive grid search on a Pixel~5 smartphone).",

Prior works on the theoretical understandings of NC have focused on analyzing the optimization landscape of matrix-factorization-like problems by considering the last-layer features as unconstrained free optimization variables and showing that their global minima exhibit NC. In this paper, we show that gradient flow on a two-layer ReLU network for classifying orthogonally separable data provably exhibits NC, thereby advancing prior results in two ways: First, we relax the assumption of unconstrained features, showing the effect of data structure and nonlinear activations on NC characterizations. Second, we reveal the role of the implicit bias of the training dynamics in facilitating the emergence of NC.",

In this work, we demonstrate that the simple and counterintuitive heuristic of selecting the shortest solution is highly effective. We posit that the observed effectiveness stems from models operating in two distinct regimes: a concise, confident conventional regime and a verbose overthinking regime characterized by uncertainty, and we show evidence of a critical point where the overthinking regime begins to be significant. By selecting the shortest answer, the heuristic preferentially samples from the conventional regime. We confirm that this approach is competitive with more complex methods such as self-consistency across two challenging benchmarks while significantly reducing computational overhead. The shortest-answer heuristic provides a Pareto improvement over self-consistency and applies even to tasks where output equality is not well defined.",

The method employs a class probability estimator (CPE) to predict non-dominance relations and to condition the generative model toward high-performing regions of the search space. We also show that this non-dominance CPE implicitly estimates the probability of hypervolume improvement (PHVI). To incorporate subjective trade-offs, A-GPS introduces preference direction vectors that encode user-specified preferences in objective space. At each iteration, the model is updated using both Pareto membership and alignment with these preference directions, producing an amortized generative model capable of sampling across the Pareto front without retraining. The result is a simple yet powerful approach that achieves high-quality Pareto set approximations, avoids explicit hypervolume computation, and flexibly captures user preferences.

While the sample complexity of online SGD is determined by the information exponent of the link function, recent works improved this by performing multiple gradient steps on the same sample with different learning rates -- yielding a non-correlational update rule -- and instead are limited by the (potentially much smaller) generative exponent. However, this picture is only valid when these learning rates are sufficiently large. In this paper, we characterize the relationship between learning rate(s) and sample complexity for a broad class of gradient-based algorithms that encapsulates both correlational and non-correlational updates. We demonstrate that, in certain cases, there is a phase transition from an \"information exponent regime\" with small learning rate to a \"generative exponent regime\" with large learning rate. Our framework covers prior analyses of one-pass SGD and SGD with batch reuse, while also introducing a new layer-wise training algorithm that leverages a two-timescales approach (via different learning rates for each layer) to go beyond correlational queries without reusing samples or modifying the loss from squared error. Our theoretical study demonstrates that the choice of learning rate is as important as the design of the algorithm in achieving statistical and computational efficiency.",

        "summary": "Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization has gained attention as a memory-efficient alternative to first-order (FO) methods, particularly in settings where gradient computation is expensive or even impractical. Beyond its memory efficiency, in this work, we investigate ZO optimization for continual learning (CL) as a novel approach to address the plasticity-stability-efficiency trilemma. Through theoretical analysis and empirical evidence, we show that ZO optimization naturally leads to flatter loss landscapes, which in turn reduce forgetting in CL. However, this stability comes at a cost of plasticity: due to its imprecise gradient estimates and slower convergence, ZO optimization tends to be less effective than FO in acquiring new task-specific knowledge, particularly under constrained training budgets. To better understand this trade-off, we conduct a holistic evaluation of ZO optimization applied to various existing CL methods. Our findings reveal that ZO optimization enhances stability but often undermines plasticity, particularly when used with learnable classifiers. Motivated by this insight, we propose ZO-FC, a simple but effective approach that applies ZO optimization to a single adapter-based PEFT module with FO optimized classifier. This design leverages the stability benefits of ZO while preserving the adaptability of FO updates with negligible memory overhead. Experiments demonstrate that ZO-FC achieves an effective balance between stability and plasticity, offering a practical and memory-efficient solution for on-device CL.",

        "summary": "Image Auto-regressive (AR) models have emerged as a powerful paradigm of visual generative models. Despite their promising performance, they suffer from slow generation speed due to the large number of sampling steps required. Although Distilled Decoding 1 (DD1) was recently proposed to enable few-step sampling for image AR models, it still incurs significant performance degradation in the one-step setting, and relies on a pre-defined mapping that limits its flexibility. In this work, we propose a new method, Distilled Decoding 2 (DD2), to further advances the feasibility of one-step sampling for image AR models. Unlike DD1, DD2 does not without rely on a pre-defined mapping. We view the original AR model as a teacher model which provides the ground truth conditional score in the latent embedding space at each token position. Based on this, we propose a novel \\emph{conditional score distillation loss} to train a one-step generator. Specifically, we train a separate network to predict the conditional score of the generated distribution and apply score distillation at every token position conditioned on previous tokens. Experimental results show that DD2 enables one-step sampling for image AR models with an minimal FID increase from 3.40 to 5.43 on ImageNet-256. Compared to the strongest baseline DD1, DD2 reduces the gap between the one-step sampling and original AR model by 67%, with up to 12.3$\\times$ training speed-up simultaneously. DD2 takes a significant step toward the goal of one-step AR generation, opening up new possibilities for fast and high-quality AR modeling.

        "summary": "Large language models have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse natural language tasks. However, comparable breakthroughs in scientific discovery are more limited, because understanding complex physical phenomena demands multifaceted representations far beyond language alone. A compelling example is the design of functional materials such as MOFs-critical for a range of impactful applications like carbon capture and hydrogen storage. Navigating their vast and intricate design space in language-based representations interpretable by LLMs is challenging due to the numerous possible three-dimensional atomic arrangements and strict reticular rules of coordination geometry and topology. Despite promising early results in LLM-assisted discovery for simpler materials systems, MOF design remains heavily reliant on tacit human expertise rarely codified in textual information alone. To overcome this barrier, we introduce L2M3OF, the first multimodal LLM for MOFs. L2M3OF integrates crystal representation learning with language understanding to process structural, textual, and knowledge modalities jointly. L2M3OF employs a pre-trained crystal encoder with a lightweight projection layer to compress structural information into a token space, enabling efficient alignment with language instructions. To facilitate training and evaluation, we curate a structure-property-knowledge database of crystalline materials and benchmark L2M3OF against state-of-the-art closed-source LLMs such as GPT-5, Gemini-2.5-Pro and DeepSeek-R1. Experiments show that L2M3OF outperforms leading text-based closed-source LLMs in property prediction and knowledge generation tasks, despite using far fewer parameters. These results highlight the importance of multimodal approaches for porous material understanding and establish L2M3OF as a foundation for next-generation AI systems in materials discovery.",

By encoding fields as continuous functions within the weights and biases of deep neural networks-rather than relying on voxel- or mesh-based structured or unstructured representations-INRs offer both resolution independence and high memory efficiency. However, their accuracy in domain-specific applications remains insufficiently understood. In this work, we assess the performance of state-of-the-art INRs for compressing hemodynamic fields derived from numerical simulations and for representing cardiovascular anatomies via signed distance functions. We investigate several strategies to mitigate spectral bias, including specialized activation functions, both fixed and trainable positional encoding, and linear combinations of nonlinear kernels. On realistic, space- and time-varying hemodynamic fields in the thoracic aorta, INRs achieved remarkable compression ratios of up to approximately 230, with maximum absolute errors of 1 mmHg for pressure and 5-10 cm/s for velocity, without extensive hyperparameter tuning. Across 48 thoracic aortic anatomies, the average and maximum absolute anatomical discrepancies were below 0.5 mm and 1.6 mm, respectively.

Yet, self-diagnosis is often unreliable on complex tasks unless aided by reliable external feedback. Multi-agent debate (MAD) seems to be a natural alternative to external feedback: multiple LLMs provide complementary perspectives and cross-checks for error detection. However, prior MAD protocols frame debate as a zero-sum game, where the debaters compete to win the game instead of seeking the truth. Consequently, it leads to debate hacking: debaters tend to mislead the judge by misinterpreting the task or presenting overconfident claims, which introduce more mistakes and underperform single-agent methods. To mitigate the issue, we introduce a new collaborative MAD protocol, termed ColMAD, that reframes MAD as a non-zero sum game. Specifically, ColMAD encourages multiple agents to criticize each other in a supportive way, such that they can complement the missing points of each other. Therefore, the judge agent can make a more informative conclusion based on more comprehensive evidence. Empirically, we show that ColMAD significantly outperforms previous competitive MAD by 19% and brings non-trivial improvements over single-agent methods in error detection.",

To address these limitations, we propose EPFL-an Ensembled Penalized Federated Learning framework that integrates continual learning, personalized modeling, and a novel Specialized Weighted Aggregation (SWA) strategy. EPFL leverages wearable sensor data to capture sequential motion patterns while preserving user privacy through homomorphic encryption and federated training. Unlike existing federated models, EPFL incorporates both penalized local training and ensemble-based inference to improve inter-client consistency and adaptability to behavioral differences. Extensive experiments on a benchmark fall detection dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving a Recall of 88.31 percent and an F1-score of 89.94 percent, significantly outperforming both centralized and baseline models.

Accordingly, we propose to leverage reversibility as a method for preventing these safety issues throughout the training process. Our method uses model-predictive path integral control to check the safety of an action proposed by a learned policy throughout training. A key advantage of this approach is that it only requires the ability to query the black-box dynamics, not explicit knowledge of the dynamics or safety constraints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully aborts before all unsafe actions, while still achieving comparable training progress to a baseline PPO approach that is allowed to violate safety.",

At a high level, LBS consists of two components: (1) a state space model (SSM) backbone that captures the temporal dynamics of latent states from which both numerical and textual observations are generated and (2) a pretrained large language model (LLM) that is adapted to encode textual inputs for posterior state estimation and decode textual forecasts consistent with the latent trajectory. This design enables flexible lookback and forecast windows, principled uncertainty quantification, and improved temporal generalization thanks to the well-suited inductive bias of SSMs toward modeling dynamical systems. Experiments on the TextTimeCorpus benchmark demonstrate that LBS improves the previous state-of-the-art by 13.20% while providing human-readable summaries of each forecast.

In this paper, we develop a set of technical machinery based on the recent large deviations and metastability analysis in Wang and Rhee (2023) and obtain sharp characterization of the global dynamics of heavy-tailed SGDs. In particular, we reveal a fascinating phenomenon in deep learning: by injecting and then truncating heavy-tailed noises during the training phase, SGD can almost completely avoid sharp minima and achieve better generalization performance for the test data. Simulation and deep learning experiments confirm our theoretical prediction that heavy-tailed SGD with gradient clipping finds local minima with a more flat geometry and achieves better generalization performance.",

We then extend the approach to two other well-known hard geometric problems: the Steiner Tree Problem and the Simple Polygon Problem. Our method treats each problem instance as an image and trains a standard visual diffusion model that transforms Gaussian noise into an image representing a valid approximate solution that closely matches the exact one. The model learns to transform noisy geometric structures into correct configurations, effectively recasting geometric reasoning as image generation. Unlike prior work that necessitates specialized architectures and domain-specific adaptations when applying diffusion to parametric geometric representations, we employ a standard visual diffusion model that operates on the visual representation of the problem. This simplicity highlights a surprising bridge between generative modeling and geometric problem solving. Beyond the specific problems studied here, our results point toward a broader paradigm: operating in image space provides a general and practical framework for approximating notoriously hard problems, and opens the door to tackling a far wider class of challenging geometric tasks.",

        "summary": "Achieving safe, reliable real-world robotic manipulation requires agents to evolve beyond vision and incorporate tactile sensing to overcome sensory deficits and reliance on idealised state information. Despite its potential, the efficacy of tactile sensing in reinforcement learning (RL) remains inconsistent. We address this by developing self-supervised learning (SSL) methodologies to more effectively harness tactile observations, focusing on a scalable setup of proprioception and sparse binary contacts. We empirically demonstrate that sparse binary tactile signals are critical for dexterity, particularly for interactions that proprioceptive control errors do not register, such as decoupled robot-object motions. Our agents achieve superhuman dexterity in complex contact tasks (ball bouncing and Baoding ball rotation). Furthermore, we find that decoupling the SSL memory from the on-policy memory can improve performance. We release the Robot Tactile Olympiad (RoTO) benchmark to standardise and promote future research in tactile-based manipulation. Project page: https://elle-miller.github.io/tactile_rl",

        "summary": "We introduce a highly expressive yet distinctly tractable family for black-box variational inference (BBVI). Each member of this family is a weighted product of experts (PoE), and each weighted expert in the product is proportional to a multivariate $t$-distribution. These products of experts can model distributions with skew, heavy tails, and multiple modes, but to use them for BBVI, we must be able to sample from their densities. We show how to do this by reformulating these products of experts as latent variable models with auxiliary Dirichlet random variables. These Dirichlet variables emerge from a Feynman identity, originally developed for loop integrals in quantum field theory, that expresses the product of multiple fractions (or in our case, $t$-distributions) as an integral over the simplex. We leverage this simplicial latent space to draw weighted samples from these products of experts -- samples which BBVI then uses to find the PoE that best approximates a target density. Given a collection of experts, we derive an iterative procedure to optimize the exponents that determine their geometric weighting in the PoE. At each iteration, this procedure minimizes a regularized Fisher divergence to match the scores of the variational and target densities at a batch of samples drawn from the current approximation. This minimization reduces to a convex quadratic program, and we prove under general conditions that these updates converge exponentially fast to a near-optimal weighting of experts. We conclude by evaluating this approach on a variety of synthetic and real-world target distributions.",

        "summary": "Biological and artificial learners are inherently exposed to a stream of data and experience throughout their lifetimes and must constantly adapt to, learn from, or selectively ignore the ongoing input. Recent findings reveal that, even when the performance remains stable, the underlying neural representations can change gradually over time, a phenomenon known as representational drift. Studying the different sources of data and noise that may contribute to drift is essential for understanding lifelong learning in neural systems. However, a systematic study of drift across architectures and learning rules, and the connection to task, are missing. Here, in an online learning setup, we characterize drift as a function of data distribution, and specifically show that the learning noise induced by task-irrelevant stimuli, which the agent learns to ignore in a given context, can create long-term drift in the representation of task-relevant stimuli. Using theory and simulations, we demonstrate this phenomenon both in Hebbian-based learning -- Oja's rule and Similarity Matching -- and in stochastic gradient descent applied to autoencoders and a supervised two-layer network. We consistently observe that the drift rate increases with the variance and the dimension of the data in the task-irrelevant subspace. We further show that this yields different qualitative predictions for the geometry and dimension-dependency of drift than those arising from Gaussian synaptic noise. Overall, our study links the structure of stimuli, task, and learning rule to representational drift and could pave the way for using drift as a signal for uncovering underlying computation in the brain.",

To address this, we introduce $\\textit{HollowFlow}$, a flow-based generative model leveraging a novel non-backtracking graph neural network (NoBGNN). By enforcing a block-diagonal Jacobian structure, HollowFlow likelihoods are evaluated with a constant number of backward passes in $n$, yielding speed-ups of up to $\\mathcal{O}(n^2)$: a significant step towards scaling BGs to larger systems. Crucially, our framework generalizes: $\\textbf{any equivariant GNN or attention-based architecture}$ can be adapted into a NoBGNN. We validate HollowFlow by training BGs on two different systems of increasing size. For both systems, the sampling and likelihood evaluation time decreases dramatically, following our theoretical scaling laws. For the larger system we obtain a $10^2\\times$ speed-up, clearly illustrating the potential of HollowFlow-based approaches for high-dimensional scientific problems previously hindered by computational bottlenecks.",

Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's risk management process as a foundation, this research iteratively analyzed 26 popular benchmarks, identifying 57 potential failure modes and 196 corresponding mitigation strategies. The mitigations reduce failure likelihood and/or severity, providing a frame for evaluating \"benchmark risk,\" which is scored to provide a metaevaluation benchmark: BenchRisk. Higher scores indicate that benchmark users are less likely to reach an incorrect or unsupported conclusion about an LLM. All 26 scored benchmarks present significant risk within one or more of the five scored dimensions (comprehensiveness, intelligibility, consistency, correctness, and longevity), which points to important open research directions for the field of LLM benchmarking.

Direct simulation is limited by short timescales; machine-learned potentials require large data sets and struggle with transition state regions essential for reaction rates. Reaction network exploration with sufficient accuracy is hampered by the computational cost of electronic structure calculations, and even simplifications like harmonic transition state theory rely on prohibitively expensive saddle point searches. Surrogate model-based acceleration has been promising but hampered by overhead and numerical instability. This dissertation presents a holistic solution, co-designing physical representations, statistical models, and systems architecture in the Optimal Transport Gaussian Process (OT-GP) framework. Using physics-aware optimal transport metrics, OT-GP creates compact, chemically relevant surrogates of the potential energy surface, underpinned by statistically robust sampling. Alongside EON software rewrites for long timescale simulations, we introduce reinforcement learning approaches for both minimum-mode following (when the final state is unknown) and nudged elastic band methods (when endpoints are specified). Collectively, these advances establish a representation-first, modular approach to chemical kinetics simulation. Large-scale benchmarks and Bayesian hierarchical validation demonstrate state-of-the-art performance and practical exploration of chemical kinetics, transforming a longstanding theoretical promise into a working engine for discovery.",

Traditional diffusion models produce high-fidelity images by performing a fixed number of denoising steps, regardless of downstream transmission limitations. However, in practical cloud-to-device scenarios, limited bandwidth often necessitates heavy compression, leading to loss of fine textures and wasted computation. To address this, we introduce a joint end-to-end training strategy where the diffusion model is conditioned on a target quality level derived from the available bandwidth. During training, the model learns to adaptively modulate the denoising process, enabling early-stop sampling that maintains perceptual quality appropriate to the target transmission condition. Our method requires minimal architectural changes and leverages a lightweight quality embedding to guide the denoising trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the visual fidelity of bandwidth-adapted generations compared to naive early-stopping, offering a promising solution for efficient image delivery in bandwidth-constrained environments.

However, the interpretability of the alignment component remains uninvestigated due to the difficulty in mapping the semantics of multi-modal representations into a unified concept set. To address this problem, we propose VL-SAE, a sparse autoencoder that encodes vision-language representations into its hidden activations. Each neuron in its hidden layer correlates to a concept represented by semantically similar images and texts, thereby interpreting these representations with a unified concept set. To establish the neuron-concept correlation, we encourage semantically similar representations to exhibit consistent neuron activations during self-supervised training. First, to measure the semantic similarity of multi-modal representations, we perform their alignment in an explicit form based on cosine similarity. Second, we construct the VL-SAE with a distance-based encoder and two modality-specific decoders to ensure the activation consistency of semantically similar representations. Experiments across multiple VLMs (e.g., CLIP, LLaVA) demonstrate the superior capability of VL-SAE in interpreting and enhancing the vision-language alignment. For interpretation, the alignment between vision and language representations can be understood by comparing their semantics with concepts. For enhancement, the alignment can be strengthened by aligning vision-language representations at the concept level, contributing to performance improvements in downstream tasks, including zero-shot image classification and hallucination elimination.

While calibration in single-output regression is well studied, defining and achieving multivariate calibration in multi-output regression remains considerably more challenging. The existing literature on multivariate calibration primarily focuses on diagnostic tools based on pre-rank functions, which are projections that reduce multivariate prediction-observation pairs to univariate summaries to detect specific types of miscalibration. In this work, we go beyond diagnostics and introduce a general regularization framework to enforce multivariate calibration during training for arbitrary pre-rank functions. This framework encompasses existing approaches such as highest density region calibration and copula calibration. Our method enforces calibration by penalizing deviations of the projected probability integral transforms (PITs) from the uniform distribution, and can be added as a regularization term to the loss function of any probabilistic predictor. Specifically, we propose a regularization loss that jointly enforces both marginal and multivariate pre-rank calibration. We also introduce a new PCA-based pre-rank that captures calibration along directions of maximal variance in the predictive distribution, while also enabling dimensionality reduction. Across 18 real-world multi-output regression datasets, we show that unregularized models are consistently miscalibrated, and that our methods significantly improve calibration across all pre-rank functions without sacrificing predictive accuracy.",

        "summary": "Internet speed tests are indispensable for users, ISPs, and policymakers, but their static flooding-based design imposes growing costs: a single high-speed test can transfer hundreds of megabytes, and collectively, platforms like Ookla, M-Lab, and Fast.com generate petabytes of traffic each month. Reducing this burden requires deciding when a test can be stopped early without sacrificing accuracy. We frame this as an optimal stopping problem and show that existing heuristics-static thresholds, BBR pipe-full signals, or throughput stability rules from Fast.com and FastBTS-capture only a narrow portion of the achievable accuracy-savings trade-off. This paper introduces TURBOTEST, a systematic framework for speed test termination that sits atop existing platforms. The key idea is to decouple throughput prediction (Stage 1) from test termination (Stage 2): Stage 1 trains a regressor to estimate final throughput from partial measurements, while Stage 2 trains a classifier to decide when sufficient evidence has accumulated to stop. Leveraging richer transport-level features (RTT, retransmissions, congestion window) alongside throughput, TURBOTEST exposes a single tunable parameter for accuracy tolerance and includes a fallback mechanism for high-variability cases. Evaluation on 173,000 M-Lab NDT speed tests (2024-2025) shows that TURBOTEST achieves nearly 2-4x higher data savings than an approach based on BBR signals while reducing median error. These results demonstrate that adaptive ML-based termination can deliver accurate, efficient, and deployable speed tests at scale.",

        "summary": "Algorithmic fairness is a socially crucial topic in real-world applications of AI. Among many notions of fairness, subgroup fairness is widely studied when multiple sensitive attributes (e.g., gender, race, age) are present. However, as the number of sensitive attributes grows, the number of subgroups increases accordingly, creating heavy computational burdens and data sparsity problem (subgroups with too small sizes). In this paper, we develop a novel learning algorithm for subgroup fairness which resolves these issues by focusing on subgroups with sufficient sample sizes as well as marginal fairness (fairness for each sensitive attribute). To this end, we formalize a notion of subgroup-subset fairness and introduce a corresponding distributional fairness measure called the supremum Integral Probability Metric (supIPM). Building on this formulation, we propose the Doubly Regressing Adversarial learning for subgroup Fairness (DRAF) algorithm, which reduces a surrogate fairness gap for supIPM with much less computation than directly reducing supIPM. Theoretically, we prove that the proposed surrogate fairness gap is an upper bound of supIPM. Empirically, we show that the DRAF algorithm outperforms baseline methods in benchmark datasets, specifically when the number of sensitive attributes is large so that many subgroups are very small.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in agentic systems that interact with an external environment; this makes them susceptible to prompt injections when dealing with untrusted data. To overcome this limitation, we propose SIC (Soft Instruction Control)-a simple yet effective iterative prompt sanitization loop designed for tool-augmented LLM agents. Our method repeatedly inspects incoming data for instructions that could compromise agent behavior. If such content is found, the malicious content is rewritten, masked, or removed, and the result is re-evaluated. The process continues until the input is clean or a maximum iteration limit is reached; if imperative instruction-like content remains, the agent halts to ensure security. By allowing multiple passes, our approach acknowledges that individual rewrites may fail but enables the system to catch and correct missed injections in later steps. Although immediately useful, worst-case analysis shows that SIC is not infallible; strong adversary can still get a 15% ASR by embedding non-imperative workflows. This nonetheless raises the bar.",

        "summary": "The global scarcity of GPUs necessitates more sophisticated strategies for Deep Learning jobs in shared cluster environments. Accurate estimation of how much GPU memory a job will require is fundamental to enabling advanced scheduling and GPU sharing, which helps prevent out-of-memory (OOM) errors and resource underutilization. However, existing estimation methods have limitations. Approaches relying on static analysis or historical data with machine learning often fail to accurately capture runtime dynamics. Furthermore, direct GPU analysis consumes scarce resources, and some techniques require intrusive code modifications. Thus, the key challenge lies in precisely estimating dynamic memory requirements, including memory allocator nuances, without consuming GPU resources and non-intrusive code changes. To address this challenge, we propose xMem, a novel framework that leverages CPU-only dynamic analysis to accurately estimate peak GPU memory requirements a priori. We conducted a thorough evaluation of xMem against state-of-the-art solutions using workloads from 25 different models, including architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks and Transformers. The analysis of 5209 runs, which includes ANOVA and Monte Carlo results, highlights xMem's benefits: it decreases the median relative error by 91% and significantly reduces the probability of estimation failure as safe OOM thresholds by 75%, meaning that the estimated value can often be used directly without causing OOM. Ultimately, these improvements lead to a 368% increase in memory conservation potential over current solutions.",

        "summary": "Meningiomas represent the most prevalent form of primary brain tumors, comprising nearly one-third of all diagnosed cases. Accurate delineation of these tumors from MRI scans is crucial for guiding treatment strategies, yet remains a challenging and time-consuming task in clinical practice. Recent developments in deep learning have accelerated progress in automated tumor segmentation; however, many advanced techniques are hindered by heavy computational demands and long training schedules, making them less accessible for researchers and clinicians working with limited hardware. In this work, we propose a novel ensemble-based segmentation approach that combines three distinct architectures: (1) a baseline SegResNet model, (2) an attention-augmented SegResNet with concatenative skip connections, and (3) a dual-decoder U-Net enhanced with attention-gated skip connections (DDUNet). The ensemble aims to leverage architectural diversity to improve robustness and accuracy while significantly reducing training demands. Each baseline model was trained for only 20 epochs and Evaluated on the BraTS-MEN 2025 dataset. The proposed ensemble model achieved competitive performance, with average Lesion-Wise Dice scores of 77.30%, 76.37% and 73.9% on test dataset for Enhancing Tumor (ET), Tumor Core (TC) and Whole Tumor (WT) respectively. These results highlight the effectiveness of ensemble learning for brain tumor segmentation, even under limited hardware constraints. Our proposed method provides a practical and accessible tool for aiding the diagnosis of meningioma, with potential impact in both clinical and research settings.",

While various approaches allow for learning the corresponding data manifold from finite samples, performing downstream tasks such as optimization directly on these learned manifolds presents a significant challenge. This work introduces a principled framework for optimization on learned data manifolds using iso-Riemannian geometry. Our approach addresses key limitations of classical Riemannian optimization in this setting, specifically, that the Levi-Civita connection fails to yield constant-speed geodesics, and that geodesic convexity assumptions break down under the learned pullback constructions commonly used in practice. To overcome these challenges, we propose new notions of monotonicity and Lipschitz continuity tailored to the iso-Riemannian setting and propose iso-Riemannian descent algorithms for which we provide a detailed convergence analysis. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of those algorithms on both synthetic and real datasets, including MNIST under a learned pullback structure. Our approach yields interpretable barycentres, improved clustering, and provably efficient solutions to inverse problems, even in high-dimensional settings. These results establish that optimization under iso-Riemannian geometry can overcome distortions inherent to learned manifold mappings.",

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of generative models has enabled the creation of increasingly stealthy synthetic voices, commonly referred to as audio deepfakes. A recent technique, FOICE [USENIX'24], demonstrates a particularly alarming capability: generating a victim's voice from a single facial image, without requiring any voice sample. By exploiting correlations between facial and vocal features, FOICE produces synthetic voices realistic enough to bypass industry-standard authentication systems, including WeChat Voiceprint and Microsoft Azure. This raises serious security concerns, as facial images are far easier for adversaries to obtain than voice samples, dramatically lowering the barrier to large-scale attacks. In this work, we investigate two core research questions: (RQ1) can state-of-the-art audio deepfake detectors reliably detect FOICE-generated speech under clean and noisy conditions, and (RQ2) whether fine-tuning these detectors on FOICE data improves detection without overfitting, thereby preserving robustness to unseen voice generators such as SpeechT5. Our study makes three contributions. First, we present the first systematic evaluation of FOICE detection, showing that leading detectors consistently fail under both standard and noisy conditions. Second, we introduce targeted fine-tuning strategies that capture FOICE-specific artifacts, yielding significant accuracy improvements. Third, we assess generalization after fine-tuning, revealing trade-offs between specialization to FOICE and robustness to unseen synthesis pipelines. These findings expose fundamental weaknesses in today's defenses and motivate new architectures and training protocols for next-generation audio deepfake detection.",

To address this challenge, we propose PCA Point Cloud (PPC), a canonicalization framework specifically tailored for downstream robotic control. PPC maps point clouds under arbitrary rigid-body transformations to a unique canonical pose, aligning observations to a consistent frame, thereby substantially decreasing viewpoint-induced inconsistencies.

We introduce SutureBot: an autonomous suturing benchmark on the da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK), spanning needle pickup, tissue insertion, and knot tying. To ensure repeatability, we release a high-fidelity dataset comprising 1,890 suturing demonstrations. Furthermore, we propose a goal-conditioned framework that explicitly optimizes insertion-point precision, improving targeting accuracy by 59\\%-74\\% over a task-only baseline.

Traditional methods such as questionnaire assessments require manual interventions and webcam-based monitoring fails to provide accurate insights into learners' mental focus as they are deceived by mere screen fixation without cognitive engagement. Existing BCI-based approaches lack real-time validation and evaluation procedures. To address these limitations, a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) system is developed using a non-invasive Electroencephalogram (EEG) headband, FocusCalm, to record brainwave activity under attentive and non-attentive states. 20 minutes of data were collected from each of 20 participants watching a pre-recorded educational video. The data validation employed a novel intra-video questionnaire assessment. Subsequently, collected signals were segmented (sliding window), filtered (butterworth bandpass), and cleaned (removal of high-amplitude and EOG artifacts such as eye blinks). Time, frequency, wavelet and statistical features have been extracted, followed by recursive feature elimination (RFE) with Support vector machines (SVMs) to classify attention and non-attention states. The leave-one-subject-out (LOSO) cross-validation accuracy has been tested to be 88.77%. The system provides feedback alerts upon non-attention state detection and keeps focus profile logs. A pilot study was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of real-time feedback. Five participants completed a 10-minute session consisting of a 5-minute baseline phase without feedback followed by a 5-minute feedback phase, during which alerts were issued if participants remained non-attentive for approximately 8 consecutive seconds. A paired t-test (t = 5.73, p = 0.007) indicated a statistically significant improvement in concentration during the feedback phase.",

Our key insight extends the classical KL divergence Fisher information relationship to arbitrary noise perturbations, going beyond the Gaussian assumption and enabling structured noise distributions. This formulation allows flexible use of randomized noise distributions that naturally account for sensor artifacts, quantization effects, and data distribution smoothing, while remaining compatible with standard diffusion training. Treating the diffusion process as a Gaussian channel, we further express the mismatched entropy between data and model, showing that the proposed objective upper bounds the negative log-likelihood (NLL). In experiments, our models achieve competitive NLL on CIFAR-10 and SOTA results on ImageNet across multiple resolutions, all without data augmentation, and the framework extends naturally to discrete data.",

        "summary": "Causal representation learning (CRL) has emerged as a powerful unsupervised framework that (i) disentangles the latent generative factors underlying high-dimensional data, and (ii) learns the cause-and-effect interactions among the disentangled variables. Despite extensive recent advances in identifiability and some practical progress, a substantial gap remains between theory and real-world practice. This paper takes a step toward closing that gap by bringing CRL to robotics, a domain that has motivated CRL. Specifically, this paper addresses the well-defined robot pose estimation -- the recovery of position and orientation from raw images -- by introducing Robotic Pose Estimation via Score-Based CRL (ROPES). Being an unsupervised framework, ROPES embodies the essence of interventional CRL by identifying those generative factors that are actuated: images are generated by intrinsic and extrinsic latent factors (e.g., joint angles, arm/limb geometry, lighting, background, and camera configuration) and the objective is to disentangle and recover the controllable latent variables, i.e., those that can be directly manipulated (intervened upon) through actuation. Interventional CRL theory shows that variables that undergo variations via interventions can be identified. In robotics, such interventions arise naturally by commanding actuators of various joints and recording images under varied controls. Empirical evaluations in semi-synthetic manipulator experiments demonstrate that ROPES successfully disentangles latent generative factors with high fidelity with respect to the ground truth. Crucially, this is achieved by leveraging only distributional changes, without using any labeled data. The paper also includes a comparison with a baseline based on a recently proposed semi-supervised framework. This paper concludes by positioning robot pose estimation as a near-practical testbed for CRL.",

BACE aggregates many micro-contacts within each anatomical region via per-region temporal encoders, applies a learnable adjacency specific to each behavioral phase, and is trained on a forecasting objective. On synthetic multivariate time series with known graphs, BACE accurately recovers ground-truth directed interactions while achieving forecasting performance comparable to state-of-the-art baselines. Applied to human subcortical LFP recorded simultaneously from eight regions during a cued reaching task, BACE yields an explicit connectivity matrix for each within-trial behavioral phase. The resulting behavioral phase-specific graphs reveal behavior-aligned reconfiguration of inter-regional influence and provide compact, interpretable adjacency matrices for comparing network organization across behavioral phases. By linking predictive success to explicit connectivity estimates, BACE offers a practical tool for generating data-driven hypotheses about the dynamic coordination of subcortical regions during behavior.",

To address these limitations, this study explores multi-threshold systems and the application of SR in multiscale applications using wavelet transforms. In the multiscale domain signals can be analyzed at different levels of resolution to better understand the underlying dynamics. We propose a double-threshold detection system that integrates two single-threshold detectors to enhance weak signal detection. We evaluate it both in the original data domain and in the multiscale domain using simulated and real-world signals and compare its performance with existing methods. Experimental results demonstrate that, in the original data domain, the proposed double-threshold detector significantly improves weak signal detection compared to conventional single-threshold approaches. Its performance is further improved in the frequency domain, requiring lower noise levels while outperforming existing detection systems. This study advances SR-based detection methodologies by introducing a robust approach to weak signal identification, with potential applications in various disciplines.",

        "summary": "AlphaFold has transformed protein structure prediction, but emerging applications such as virtual ligand screening, proteome-wide folding, and de novo binder design demand predictions at a massive scale, where runtime and memory costs become prohibitive. A major bottleneck lies in the Pairformer backbone of AlphaFold3-style models, which relies on computationally expensive triangular primitives-especially triangle attention-for pairwise reasoning. We introduce Pairmixer, a streamlined alternative that eliminates triangle attention while preserving higher-order geometric reasoning capabilities that are critical for structure prediction. Pairmixer substantially improves computational efficiency, matching state-of-the-art structure predictors across folding and docking benchmarks, delivering up to 4x faster inference on long sequences while reducing training cost by 34%. Its efficiency alleviates the computational burden of downstream applications such as modeling large protein complexes, high-throughput ligand and binder screening, and hallucination-based design. Within BoltzDesign, for example, Pairmixer delivers over 2x faster sampling and scales to sequences ~30% longer than the memory limits of Pairformer.",

        "summary": "We present Stable Video Materials 3D (SViM3D), a framework to predict multi-view consistent physically based rendering (PBR) materials, given a single image. Recently, video diffusion models have been successfully used to reconstruct 3D objects from a single image efficiently. However, reflectance is still represented by simple material models or needs to be estimated in additional steps to enable relighting and controlled appearance edits. We extend a latent video diffusion model to output spatially varying PBR parameters and surface normals jointly with each generated view based on explicit camera control. This unique setup allows for relighting and generating a 3D asset using our model as neural prior. We introduce various mechanisms to this pipeline that improve quality in this ill-posed setting. We show state-of-the-art relighting and novel view synthesis performance on multiple object-centric datasets. Our method generalizes to diverse inputs, enabling the generation of relightable 3D assets useful in AR/VR, movies, games and other visual media.",
