        "summary": "In multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (MADRL), agents can communicate with one another to perform a task in a coordinated manner. When multiple tasks are involved, agents can also leverage knowledge from one task to improve learning in other tasks. In this paper, we propose Multi-task Communication Skills (MCS), a MADRL with communication method that learns and performs multiple tasks simultaneously, with agents interacting through learnable communication protocols. MCS employs a Transformer encoder to encode task-specific observations into a shared message space, capturing shared communication skills among agents. To enhance coordination among agents, we introduce a prediction network that correlates messages with the actions of sender agents in each task. We adapt three multi-agent benchmark environments to multi-task settings, where the number of agents as well as the observation and action spaces vary across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that MCS achieves better performance than multi-task MADRL baselines without communication, as well as single-task MADRL baselines with and without communication.",

        "summary": "Large language models enable flexible multi-agent planning but remain fragile in practice: verification is often circular, state changes are not tracked for repair, and small faults trigger costly global recomputation. We present ALAS, a stateful, disruption-aware framework that separates planning from non-circular validation, records a versioned execution log for grounded checks and restore points, and performs localized repair that preserves work in progress. The validator operates independently of the planning LLM with fresh, bounded context, avoiding self-check loops and mid-context attrition. The repair protocol edits only the minimal affected region under explicit policies (retry, catch, timeout, backoff, idempotency keys, compensation, loop guards) defined in a canonical workflow IR that maps to Amazon States Language and Argo Workflows. On job-shop scheduling suites (DMU, TA) across five classical benchmarks, ALAS matches or exceeds strong single-LLM and multi-agent baselines, achieving 83.7% success, reducing token usage by 60%, and running 1.82times faster under comparable settings. A minimal reliability study shows that the validator detects injected structural faults with low overhead, and that localized repair contains runtime perturbations with a bounded edit radius and less makespan degradation than global recompute. Results indicate that the combination of validator isolation, versioned execution logs, and localized repair provides measurable efficiency, feasibility, and scalability for multi-agent LLM planning. Code and seeds will be released.",

While recent breakthroughs have matched elite human play at no-limit Texas hold'em, the multi-player dynamics are subdued: most hands converge quickly with only two players engaged through multiple rounds of bidding. In this paper, we present Solly, the first AI agent to achieve elite human play in reduced-format Liar's Poker, a game characterized by extensive multi-player engagement. We trained Solly using self-play with a model-free, actor-critic, deep reinforcement learning algorithm. Solly played at an elite human level as measured by win rate (won over 50% of hands) and equity (money won) in heads-up and multi-player Liar's Poker. Solly also outperformed large language models (LLMs), including those with reasoning abilities, on the same metrics. Solly developed novel bidding strategies, randomized play effectively, and was not easily exploitable by world-class human players.",

        "summary": "As the \"agentic web\" takes shape-billions of AI agents (often LLM-powered) autonomously transacting and collaborating-trust shifts from human oversight to protocol design. In 2025, several inter-agent protocols crystallized this shift, including Google's Agent-to-Agent (A2A), Agent Payments Protocol (AP2), and Ethereum's ERC-8004 \"Trustless Agents,\" yet their underlying trust assumptions remain under-examined. This paper presents a comparative study of trust models in inter-agent protocol design: Brief (self- or third-party verifiable claims), Claim (self-proclaimed capabilities and identity, e.g. AgentCard), Proof (cryptographic verification, including zero-knowledge proofs and trusted execution environment attestations), Stake (bonded collateral with slashing and insurance), Reputation (crowd feedback and graph-based trust signals), and Constraint (sandboxing and capability bounding). For each, we analyze assumptions, attack surfaces, and design trade-offs, with particular emphasis on LLM-specific fragilities-prompt injection, sycophancy/nudge-susceptibility, hallucination, deception, and misalignment-that render purely reputational or claim-only approaches brittle. Our findings indicate no single mechanism suffices. We argue for trustless-by-default architectures anchored in Proof and Stake to gate high-impact actions, augmented by Brief for identity and discovery and Reputation overlays for flexibility and social signals. We comparatively evaluate A2A, AP2, ERC-8004 and related historical variations in academic research under metrics spanning security, privacy, latency/cost, and social robustness (Sybil/collusion/whitewashing resistance). We conclude with hybrid trust model recommendations that mitigate reputation gaming and misinformed LLM behavior, and we distill actionable design guidelines for safer, interoperable, and scalable agent economies.",

We propose atomic transactions-based multiagent transition systems and protocols as a formal framework to study them; introduce essential agents -- minimal sets of agents the removal of which makes communication impossible; and show that the cardinality of essential agents partitions all global platforms into four classes: 1. Centralised -- one (the server) 2. Decentralised -- finite $>1$ (bootstrap nodes) 3. Federated -- infinite but not universal (all servers) 4. Grassroots -- universal (all agents) Our illustrative formal example is a global social network, for which we provide centralised, decentralised, federated, and grassroots specifications via multiagent atomic transactions, and prove they satisfy basic correctness properties. We discuss informally additional global platforms -- currencies, ``sharing economy'' apps, AI, and more. While this may be the first characterisation of centralised, decentralised, and federated global platforms, grassroots platforms have been formally defined previously, but using different notions. Here, we prove that their original definition implies that all agents are essential, placing grassroots platforms in a distinct class within the broader formal context that includes all global platforms. This work provides the first mathematical framework for classifying any global platform -- existing or imagined -- by providing a multiagent atomic-transactions specification of it and determining the cardinality of the minimal set of essential agents in the ensuing multiagent protocol.

        "summary": "The engineering design process often demands expertise from multiple domains, leading to complex collaborations and iterative refinements. Traditional methods can be resource-intensive and prone to inefficiencies. To address this, we formalize the engineering design process through a multi-agent AI framework that integrates structured design and review loops. The framework introduces specialized knowledge-driven agents that collaborate to generate and refine design candidates. As an exemplar, we demonstrate its application to the aerodynamic optimization of 4-digit NACA airfoils. The framework consists of three key AI agents: a Graph Ontologist, a Design Engineer, and a Systems Engineer. The Graph Ontologist employs a Large Language Model (LLM) to construct two domain-specific knowledge graphs from airfoil design literature. The Systems Engineer, informed by a human manager, formulates technical requirements that guide design generation and evaluation. The Design Engineer leverages the design knowledge graph and computational tools to propose candidate airfoils meeting these requirements. The Systems Engineer reviews and provides feedback both qualitative and quantitative using its own knowledge graph, forming an iterative feedback loop until a design is validated by the manager. The final design is then optimized to maximize performance metrics such as the lift-to-drag ratio. Overall, this work demonstrates how collaborative AI agents equipped with structured knowledge representations can enhance efficiency, consistency, and quality in the engineering design process.",

        "summary": "The agent-environment co-design paradigm jointly optimises agent policies and environment configurations in search of improved system performance. With application domains ranging from warehouse logistics to windfarm management, co-design promises to fundamentally change how we deploy multi-agent systems. However, current co-design methods struggle to scale. They collapse under high-dimensional environment design spaces and suffer from sample inefficiency when addressing moving targets inherent to joint optimisation. We address these challenges by developing Diffusion Co-Design (DiCoDe), a scalable and sample-efficient co-design framework pushing co-design towards practically relevant settings. DiCoDe incorporates two core innovations. First, we introduce Projected Universal Guidance (PUG), a sampling technique that enables DiCoDe to explore a distribution of reward-maximising environments while satisfying hard constraints such as spatial separation between obstacles. Second, we devise a critic distillation mechanism to share knowledge from the reinforcement learning critic, ensuring that the guided diffusion model adapts to evolving agent policies using a dense and up-to-date learning signal. Together, these improvements lead to superior environment-policy pairs when validated on challenging multi-agent environment co-design benchmarks including warehouse automation, multi-agent pathfinding and wind farm optimisation. Our method consistently exceeds the state-of-the-art, achieving, for example, 39% higher rewards in the warehouse setting with 66% fewer simulation samples. This sets a new standard in agent-environment co-design, and is a stepping stone towards reaping the rewards of co-design in real world domains.",

But autonomous and interoperable trust establishing becomes a fundamental prerequisite once agents start to operate beyond isolated environments and engage in dialogues across individual or organizational boundaries. A promising way to fill this gap in Agentic AI is to equip agents with long-lived digital identities and introduce tamper-proof and flexible identity-bound attestations of agents, provisioned by commonly trusted third parties and designed for cross-domain verifiability. This article presents a conceptual framework and a prototypical multi-agent system, where each agent is endowed with a self-sovereign digital identity. It combines a unique and ledger-anchored Decentralized Identifier (DID) of an agent with a set of third-party issued Verifiable Credentials (VCs). This enables agents at the start of a dialog to prove ownership of their self-controlled DIDs for authentication purposes and to establish various cross-domain trust relationships through the spontaneous exchange of their self-hosted DID-bound VCs. A comprehensive evaluation of the prototypical implementation demonstrates technical feasibility but also reveals limitations once an agent's LLM is in sole charge to control the respective security procedures.",

We introduce a perspectivist annotation scheme for the HCRC MapTask corpus (Anderson et al., 1991) that separately captures speaker and addressee grounded interpretations for each reference expression, enabling us to trace how understanding emerges, diverges, and repairs over time. Using a scheme-constrained LLM annotation pipeline, we obtain 13k annotated reference expressions with reliability estimates and analyze the resulting understanding states. The results show that full misunderstandings are rare once lexical variants are unified, but multiplicity discrepancies systematically induce divergences, revealing how apparent grounding can mask referential misalignment. Our framework provides both a resource and an analytic lens for studying grounded misunderstanding and for evaluating (V)LLMs' capacity to model perspective-dependent grounding in collaborative dialogue.",

Conspiracy beliefs play a central role in the spread of misinformation and in shaping distrust toward institutions, making them a critical testbed for evaluating the social fidelity of LLMs. LLMs are increasingly used as proxies for studying human behavior, yet little is known about whether they reproduce higher-order psychological constructs such as a conspiratorial mindset. To bridge this research gap, we administer validated psychometric surveys measuring conspiracy mindset to multiple models under different prompting and conditioning strategies. Our findings reveal that LLMs show partial agreement with elements of conspiracy belief, and conditioning with socio-demographic attributes produces uneven effects, exposing latent demographic biases. Moreover, targeted prompts can easily shift model responses toward conspiratorial directions, underscoring both the susceptibility of LLMs to manipulation and the potential risks of their deployment in sensitive contexts. These results highlight the importance of critically evaluating the psychological dimensions embedded in LLMs, both to advance computational social science and to inform possible mitigation strategies against harmful uses.",

        "summary": "Zero-Shot Stance Detection (ZSSD) identifies the attitude of the post toward unseen targets. Existing research using contrastive, meta-learning, or data augmentation suffers from generalizability issues or lack of coherence between text and target. Recent works leveraging large language models (LLMs) for ZSSD focus either on improving unseen target-specific knowledge or generating explanations for stance analysis. However, most of these works are limited by their over-reliance on explicit reasoning, provide coarse explanations that lack nuance, and do not explicitly model the reasoning process, making it difficult to interpret the model's predictions. To address these issues, in our study, we develop a novel interpretable ZSSD framework, IRIS. We provide an interpretable understanding of the attitude of the input towards the target implicitly based on sequences within the text (implicit rationales) and explicitly based on linguistic measures (explicit rationales). IRIS considers stance detection as an information retrieval ranking task, understanding the relevance of implicit rationales for different stances to guide the model towards correct predictions without requiring the ground-truth of rationales, thus providing inherent interpretability. In addition, explicit rationales based on communicative features help decode the emotional and cognitive dimensions of stance, offering an interpretable understanding of the author's attitude towards the given target. Extensive experiments on the benchmark datasets of VAST, EZ-STANCE, P-Stance, and RFD using 50%, 30%, and even 10% training data prove the generalizability of our model, benefiting from the proposed architecture and interpretable design.",

        "summary": "This paper presents the first empirical demonstration of controllable locality in transformer language models, a novel architectural framework that enables continuous control over the degree of representation localization through a tunable locality dial parameter. Unlike traditional language models that rely exclusively on distributed representations, our approach allows dynamic interpolation between highly interpretable localist encodings and efficient distributed representations without requiring model retraining. We conducted experiments on the WikiText corpus using a two-layer transformer architecture, systematically varying the locality parameter {\\lambda} across the full spectrum from 1.0 (fully localist) to 0.0 (fully distributed). Our results demonstrate that localist configurations achieve dramatically lower attention entropy, with {\\lambda} = 1.0 yielding 5.36 bits compared to 7.18 bits at {\\lambda} = 0.0, while maintaining substantially higher pointer fidelity scores reflecting stronger alignment with rule-specified targets. Prediction experiments reveal that intermediate locality values optimize the tradeoff between interpretability and performance, with {\\lambda} = 0.6 achieving test perplexity of 4.65 and accuracy of 84.7%. These findings establish that localist language models provide a practical framework for applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability, offering precise mathematical control over the interpretability-performance spectrum through explicit penalty thresholds and information-theoretic design principles.",

We aim to create large, high-quality datasets for comparison of logical reasoning skills across several languages and of suitable difficulty for LLMs of various reasoning ability.

We find puzzle sizes 2x3 and 4x5 are sufficiently challenging for GPT-4o mini (a non-reasoning model) and o3-mini (a reasoning model), respectively. Including 5 red herrings decreases o3-mini puzzle-level accuracy on 4x5 puzzles by 15$\\pm$7 %. Scores of o3-mini on 4x5 puzzles are not significantly affected by use of English vs. Danish or the common houses theme vs. the country-specific smoerrebroed theme. We find no correlation between difficulty and the selected clue types. Datasets of 128+1024 puzzles are published as MultiZebraLogic in each of nine Germanic languages for sizes 2x3 and 4x5.

        "summary": "Any finite set of training data is consistent with an infinite number of hypothetical algorithms that could have generated it. Studies have shown that when human children learn language, they consistently favor hypotheses based on hierarchical syntactic rules without ever encountering disambiguating examples. A recent line of work has inquired as to whether common neural network architectures share this bias, finding that they do so only under special conditions: when syntactically supervised, when pre-trained on massive corpora, or when trained long past convergence. In this paper, we demonstrate, for the first time, neural network architectures that are able to generalize in human-like fashion without any of the aforementioned requirements: stack-augmented neural networks. We test three base architectures (transformer, simple RNN, LSTM) augmented with two styles of stack: the superposition stack of Joulin & Mikolov (2015) and a nondeterministic generalization of it proposed by DuSell & Chiang (2023). We find that transformers with nondeterministic stacks generalize best out of these architectures on a classical question formation task. We also propose a modification to the stack RNN architecture that improves hierarchical generalization. These results suggest that stack-augmented neural networks may be more accurate models of human language acquisition than standard architectures, serving as useful objects of psycholinguistic study.

Existing benchmarks are often limited to a fixed number of turns, making them susceptible to saturation and failing to account for the user's interactive experience. In this work, we propose an extensible framework for assessing multi-turn instruction-following ability. At its core, our framework decouples linguistic surface forms from user intent simulation through a three-layer mechanism that tracks constraints, instructions, and topics. This framework mimics User-LLM interaction by enabling the dynamic construction of benchmarks with state changes and tracebacks, terminating a conversation only when the model exhausts a simulated user's patience. We define a suite of metrics capturing the quality of the interaction process. Using this framework, we construct EvolIF, an evolving instruction-following benchmark incorporating nine distinct constraint types. Our results indicate that GPT-5 exhibits superior instruction-following performance. It sustains an average of 18.54 conversational turns and demonstrates 70.31% robustness, outperforming Gemini-2.5-Pro by a significant margin of 11.41%, while other models lag far behind.

        "summary": "Memory systems are key components that enable AI systems such as LLMs and AI agents to achieve long-term learning and sustained interaction. However, during memory storage and retrieval, these systems frequently exhibit memory hallucinations, including fabrication, errors, conflicts, and omissions. Existing evaluations of memory hallucinations are primarily end-to-end question answering, which makes it difficult to localize the operational stage within the memory system where hallucinations arise. To address this, we introduce the Hallucination in Memory Benchmark (HaluMem), the first operation level hallucination evaluation benchmark tailored to memory systems. HaluMem defines three evaluation tasks (memory extraction, memory updating, and memory question answering) to comprehensively reveal hallucination behaviors across different operational stages of interaction. To support evaluation, we construct user-centric, multi-turn human-AI interaction datasets, HaluMem-Medium and HaluMem-Long. Both include about 15k memory points and 3.5k multi-type questions. The average dialogue length per user reaches 1.5k and 2.6k turns, with context lengths exceeding 1M tokens, enabling evaluation of hallucinations across different context scales and task complexities. Empirical studies based on HaluMem show that existing memory systems tend to generate and accumulate hallucinations during the extraction and updating stages, which subsequently propagate errors to the question answering stage. Future research should focus on developing interpretable and constrained memory operation mechanisms that systematically suppress hallucinations and improve memory reliability.",

To prevent over-correction, it uses reinforcement learning (RL) to align the model's objective with precise correction, not just paraphrasing. Our results demonstrate that knowledge augmentation is critical for understanding faulty questions. Furthermore, RL-based alignment proves significantly more effective than traditional supervised fine-tuning (SFT), boosting the model's ability to follow instructions and generalize.

We first train a hybrid model that can operate in both reasoning and non-reasoning modes, and then further train it on CoT-annotated data to internalize structured reasoning, while enforcing concise, thought-free outputs at inference time using the no-reasoning mode. Unlike compression-based approaches, 3TF improves the reasoning quality of non-reasoning outputs, enabling models to perform rich internal reasoning implicitly while keeping external outputs short. Empirically, 3TF-trained models obtain large improvements on reasoning benchmarks under thought-free inference, demonstrating that high quality reasoning can be learned and executed implicitly without explicit step-by-step generation.",

This work investigates BPE segmentation recipes across various data volumes and language pairs to evaluate MT system performance. We find that utilizing asymmetric BPE, where the source and target languages have different NMOs, significantly improves results over the symmetric approach, especially in low-resource settings (50K, 100K, and 500K sentence pairs). Specifically, asymmetric BPE yield statistically significant ($p<0.05$) average gains of 5.32, 4.46, and 0.7 CHRF++ on English-Hindi in low-resource setups. We validated this trend across six additional language pairs (English and Telugu, Shona, Norwegian, Kyrgyz, Hausa, and Inuktitut), observing statistically significant improvement in 10 out of 12 systems compared to symmetric BPE. Our findings indicate a high NMO for the source (4K to 32K) and a low NMO for the target (0.5K to 2K) provides optimal results, particularly benefiting low-resource MT.",

While small language models (SLMs) offer a practical alternative, they suffer from a significant performance gap compared to LLMs in playing emotionally charged complex personas, especially for credit negotiation. This paper introduces EQ-Negotiator, a novel framework that bridges this capability gap using emotional personas. Its core is a reasoning system that integrates game theory with a Hidden Markov Model(HMM) to learn and track debtor emotional states online, without pre-training. This allows EQ-Negotiator to equip SLMs with the strategic intelligence to counter manipulation while de-escalating conflict and upholding ethical standards. Through extensive agent-to-agent simulations across diverse credit negotiation scenarios, including adversarial debtor strategies like cheating, threatening, and playing the victim, we show that a 7B parameter language model with EQ-Negotiator achieves better debt recovery and negotiation efficiency than baseline LLMs more than 10 times its size. This work advances persona modeling from descriptive character profiles to dynamic emotional architectures that operate within privacy constraints. Besides, this paper establishes that strategic emotional intelligence, not raw model scale, is the critical factor for success in automated negotiation, paving the way for effective, ethical, and privacy-preserving AI negotiators that can operate on the edge.",

However, evaluating the fairness of models is a complex challenge, and approaches that do so typically utilize standard question-answer (QA) styled schemes. Such methods often overlook deeper issues by interpreting the model's refusal responses as positive fairness measurements, which creates a false sense of fairness. In this work, we introduce the concept of silenced biases, which are unfair preferences encoded within models' latent space and are effectively concealed by safety-alignment. Previous approaches that considered similar indirect biases often relied on prompt manipulation or handcrafted implicit queries, which present limited scalability and risk contaminating the evaluation process with additional biases. We propose the Silenced Bias Benchmark (SBB), which aims to uncover these biases by employing activation steering to reduce model refusals during QA. SBB supports easy expansion to new demographic groups and subjects, presenting a fairness evaluation framework that encourages the future development of fair models and tools beyond the masking effects of alignment training. We demonstrate our approach over multiple LLMs, where our findings expose an alarming distinction between models' direct responses and their underlying fairness issues.",

        "summary": "Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has become a transformative approach in bioinformatics that often enables advancements in genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, structural biology, and drug discovery. To systematically identify and evaluate these growing developments, this review proposed six research questions (RQs), according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis methods. The objective is to evaluate impactful GenAI strategies in methodological advancement, predictive performance, and specialization, and to identify promising approaches for advanced modeling, data-intensive discovery, and integrative biological analysis. RQ1 highlights diverse applications across multiple bioinformatics subfields (sequence analysis, molecular design, and integrative data modeling), which demonstrate superior performance over traditional methods through pattern recognition and output generation. RQ2 reveals that adapted specialized model architectures outperformed general-purpose models, an advantage attributed to targeted pretraining and context-aware strategies. RQ3 identifies significant benefits in the bioinformatics domains, focusing on molecular analysis and data integration, which improves accuracy and reduces errors in complex analysis. RQ4 indicates improvements in structural modeling, functional prediction, and synthetic data generation, validated by established benchmarks. RQ5 suggests the main constraints, such as the lack of scalability and biases in data that impact generalizability, and proposes future directions focused on robust evaluation and biologically grounded modeling. RQ6 examines that molecular datasets (such as UniProtKB and ProteinNet12), cellular datasets (such as CELLxGENE and GTEx) and textual resources (such as PubMedQA and OMIM) broadly support the training and generalization of GenAI models.",

        "summary": "A recent advancement in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) research is the emergence of \"reasoning MLLMs\" that offer explicit control over their internal thinking processes (normally referred as the \"thinking mode\") alongside the standard \"non-thinking mode\". This capability allows these models to engage in a step-by-step process of internal deliberation before generating a final response. With the rapid transition to and adoption of these \"dual-state\" MLLMs, this work rigorously evaluated how the enhanced reasoning processes of these MLLMs impact model performance and reliability in clinical tasks. This paper evaluates the active \"thinking mode\" capabilities of two leading MLLMs, Seed1.5-VL and Gemini-2.5-Flash, for medical applications. We assessed their performance on four visual medical tasks using VQA-RAD and ROCOv2 datasets. Our findings reveal that the improvement from activating the thinking mode remains marginal compared to the standard non-thinking mode for the majority of the tasks. Their performance on complex medical tasks such as open-ended VQA and medical image interpretation remains suboptimal, highlighting the need for domain-specific medical data and more advanced methods for medical knowledge integration.",

        "summary": "Automatic evaluation of speech-to-text translation (ST) systems is typically performed by comparing translation hypotheses with one or more reference translations. While effective to some extent, this approach inherits the limitation of reference-based evaluation that ignores valuable information from the source input. In machine translation (MT), recent progress has shown that neural metrics incorporating the source text achieve stronger correlation with human judgments. Extending this idea to ST, however, is not trivial because the source is audio rather than text, and reliable transcripts or alignments between source and references are often unavailable. In this work, we conduct the first systematic study of source-aware metrics for ST, with a particular focus on real-world operating conditions where source transcripts are not available. We explore two complementary strategies for generating textual proxies of the input audio, automatic speech recognition (ASR) transcripts, and back-translations of the reference translation, and introduce a novel two-step cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm to address the alignment mismatch between synthetic sources and reference translations. Our experiments, carried out on two ST benchmarks covering 79 language pairs and six ST systems with diverse architectures and performance levels, show that ASR transcripts constitute a more reliable synthetic source than back-translations when word error rate is below 20%, while back-translations always represent a computationally cheaper but still effective alternative. Furthermore, our cross-lingual re-segmentation algorithm enables robust use of source-aware MT metrics in ST evaluation, paving the way toward more accurate and principled evaluation methodologies for speech translation.",

        "summary": "We revisit continual pre-training for large language models and argue that progress now depends more on scaling the right structure than on scaling parameters alone. We introduce SCALE, a width upscaling architecture that inserts lightweight expansion into linear modules while freezing all pre-trained parameters. This preserves the residual and attention topologies and increases capacity without perturbing the base model's original functionality. SCALE is guided by two principles: Persistent Preservation, which maintains the base model's behavior via preservation-oriented initialization and freezing of the pre-trained weights, and Collaborative Adaptation, which selectively trains a subset of expansion components to acquire new knowledge with minimal interference. We instantiate these ideas as SCALE-Preserve (preservation-first), SCALE-Adapt (adaptation-first), and SCALE-Route, an optional routing extension that performs token-level routing between preservation and adaptation heads. On a controlled synthetic biography benchmark, SCALE mitigates the severe forgetting observed with depth expansion while still acquiring new knowledge. In continual pre-training on a Korean corpus, SCALE variants achieve less forgetting on English evaluations and competitive gains on Korean benchmarks, with these variants offering the best overall stability-plasticity trade-off. Accompanying analysis clarifies when preservation provably holds and why the interplay between preservation and adaptation stabilizes optimization compared to standard continual learning setups.",

Thus, the increasing prominence of RAG alongside Large Language Models (LLMs) has sparked interest in comparing the performance of different LLMs in question-answering (QA) in diverse domains. This study compares the performance of four open-source LLMs, Mistral-7b-instruct, LLaMa2-7b-chat, Falcon-7b-instruct and Orca-mini-v3-7b, and OpenAI's trending GPT-3.5 over QA tasks within the computer science literature leveraging RAG support. Evaluation metrics employed in the study include accuracy and precision for binary questions and ranking by a human expert, ranking by Google's AI model Gemini, alongside cosine similarity for long-answer questions. GPT-3.5, when paired with RAG, effectively answers binary and long-answer questions, reaffirming its status as an advanced LLM. Regarding open-source LLMs, Mistral AI's Mistral-7b-instruct paired with RAG surpasses the rest in answering both binary and long-answer questions. However, among the open-source LLMs, Orca-mini-v3-7b reports the shortest average latency in generating responses, whereas LLaMa2-7b-chat by Meta reports the highest average latency. This research underscores the fact that open-source LLMs, too, can go hand in hand with proprietary models like GPT-3.5 with better infrastructure.",

We present IndicSuperTokenizer, a tokenizer for Indic multilingual LLMs, that combines both subword and multi-word tokenization, along with language-specific pre-tokenization, leading to more linguistically aligned tokens and achieving a new state-of-the-art in fertility score. Evaluated across English, 22 Indian languages and code data, our tokenizer improves the average fertility score by 39.5% over LLaMA4 and by 18% over Sutra (the current best).

Our system comprises three autonomous steps: 1) a Knowledge Graph (KG) Retrieval for rapid one - hop lookups in DBpedia, 2) an LM-based classification guided by a task-specific labeling prompt, producing outputs with internal rule-based logic, and 3) a Web Search Agent invoked only when KG coverage is insufficient. Our pipeline achieves an F1 score of 0.93 on the FEVER benchmark on the Supported/Refuted split without task- specific fine - tuning. To address Not enough information cases, we conduct a targeted reannotation study showing that our approach frequently uncovers valid evidence for claims originally labeled as Not Enough Information (NEI), as confirmed by both expert annotators and LLM reviewers.

Leveraging a Concept Iterative Retrieval Algorithm, these relations and related descriptions are dynamically supplied to the LLM, improving its ability to interpret concepts and generate accurate responses. Unlike conventional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approaches that rely on extended context windows, our method enables large language models to process texts of any length without the need for truncation.

To address this, we introduce BengaliMoralBench, the first large-scale ethics benchmark for the Bengali language and socio-cultural contexts. It covers five moral domains, Daily Activities, Habits, Parenting, Family Relationships, and Religious Activities, subdivided into 50 culturally relevant subtopics. Each scenario is annotated via native-speaker consensus using three ethical lenses: Virtue, Commonsense, and Justice ethics. We conduct systematic zero-shot evaluation of prominent multilingual LLMs, including Llama, Gemma, Qwen, and DeepSeek, using a unified prompting protocol and standard metrics. Performance varies widely (50-91% accuracy), with qualitative analysis revealing consistent weaknesses in cultural grounding, commonsense reasoning, and moral fairness.

Our analysis reveals that information-based methods, which leverage token and sequence probabilities, perform exceptionally well in ID settings due to their alignment with the model's understanding of the data. Conversely, density-based methods and the P(True) metric exhibit superior performance in OOD contexts, highlighting their effectiveness in capturing the model's epistemic uncertainty.

Yet, existing multimodal benchmarks either overemphasize textual reasoning or fall short of systematically capturing vision-centric cognitive behaviors, leaving the cognitive capacity of MLLMs insufficiently assessed. To address this limitation, we introduce MME-CC (Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of Cognitive Capacity), a vision-grounded benchmark that organizes 11 representative reasoning tasks into three fundamental categories of visual information: spatial, geometric, and knowledge-based reasoning, and provides fine-grained analyses of MLLMs' cognitive capacity across these dimensions. Based on MME-CC, we conduct extensive experiments over 16 representative MLLMs. Our study reveals that closed-source models currently lead overall (e.g., 42.66 for Gemini-2.5-Pro vs. 30.45 for GLM-4.5V), while spatial and geometric reasoning remain broadly weak (less than or equal to 30%). We further identify common error patterns, including orientation mistakes, fragile cross-view identity persistence, and poor adherence to counterfactual instructions, and observe that Chain-of-Thought typically follows a three-stage process (extract -> reason -> verify) with heavy reliance on visual extraction. We hope this work catalyzes a shift toward treating the cognitive capacity of MLLMs as central to both evaluation and model design.",

Traditional TN systems can exhibit high accuracy, but involve substantial engineering effort, are difficult to scale, and pose challenges to language coverage, particularly in low-resource settings. We propose PolyNorm, a prompt-based approach to TN using Large Language Models (LLMs), aiming to reduce the reliance on manually crafted rules and enable broader linguistic applicability with minimal human intervention. Additionally, we present a language-agnostic pipeline for automatic data curation and evaluation, designed to facilitate scalable experimentation across diverse languages. Experiments across eight languages show consistent reductions in the word error rate (WER) compared to a production-grade-based system. To support further research, we release PolyNorm-Benchmark, a multilingual data set covering a diverse range of text normalization phenomena.",

We formalize this as the one-sided conversation problem (1SC): inferring and learning from one side of a conversation. We study two tasks: (1) reconstructing the missing speaker's turns for real-time use cases, and (2) generating summaries from one-sided transcripts. Evaluating prompting and finetuned models on MultiWOZ, DailyDialog, and Candor with both human A/B testing and LLM-as-a-judge metrics, we find that access to one future turn and information about utterance length improves reconstruction, placeholder prompting helps to mitigate hallucination, and while large models generate promising reconstructions with prompting, smaller models require finetuning. Further, high-quality summaries can be generated without reconstructing missing turns. We present 1SC as a novel challenge and report promising results that mark a step toward privacy-aware conversational AI.",

Despite its rapid growth and broad potential, ABSA research and resources remain concentrated in commercial domains, leaving analytical needs unmet in high-demand yet low-resource areas such as education and healthcare. Domain adaptation challenges and most existing methods' reliance on resource-intensive in-training knowledge injection further hinder progress in these areas. Moreover, traditional evaluation methods based on exact matches are overly rigid for ABSA tasks, penalising any boundary variations which may misrepresent the performance of generative models. This work addresses these gaps through three contributions: 1) We propose a novel evaluation method, Flexible Text Similarity Matching and Optimal Bipartite Pairing (FTS-OBP), which accommodates realistic extraction boundary variations while maintaining strong correlation with traditional metrics and offering fine-grained diagnostics. 2) We present the first ABSA study of small decoder-only generative language models (SLMs; <7B parameters), examining resource lower bounds via a case study in education review ABSA. We systematically explore data-free (in-context learning and weight merging) and data-light fine-tuning methods, and propose a multitask fine-tuning strategy that significantly enhances SLM performance, enabling 1.5-3.8 B models to surpass proprietary large models and approach benchmark results with only 200-1,000 examples on a single GPU. 3) We release the first public set of education review ABSA resources to support future research in low-resource domains.",

        "summary": "Despite recent progress in using Large Language Models (LLMs) for automatically generating 3D scenes, generated scenes often lack realistic spatial layouts and object attributes found in real-world environments. As this problem stems from insufficiently detailed, coarse-grained instructions, advancing 3D scene synthesis guided by more detailed, fine-grained instructions that reflect real-world environments becomes crucial. Without such realistic scenes, training embodied agents in unrealistic environments can lead them to learn priors that diverge significantly from real-world physics and semantics, degrading their performance when deployed. Thus, verifying the alignment between the fine-grained instruction and the generated scene is essential for effective learning. However, current evaluation methods, such as CLIPScore and vision-language models (VLMs), often fail to reliably assess such alignment. This shortcoming arises primarily from their shallow understanding of 3D scenes, which often leads to improperly grounded scene components. To address this, we introduce LEGO-Eval, an evaluation framework equipped with diverse tools designed to explicitly ground scene components, enabling more accurate alignment assessments. We also present LEGO-Bench, a benchmark of detailed instructions that specify complex layouts and attributes of real-world environments. Experiments demonstrate that LEGO-Eval outperforms VLM-as-a-judge by 0.41 F1 score in assessing scene-instruction alignment. Benchmarking with LEGO-Bench reveals significant limitations in current generation methods. Across all evaluated approaches, success rates reached at most 10% in generating scenes that fully align with fine-grained instructions.",

Therefore, we introduce ARC (Agent RAG Cache Mechanism), a novel, annotation-free caching framework that dynamically manages small, high-value corpora for each agent. By synthesizing historical query distribution patterns with the intrinsic geometry of cached items in the embedding space, ARC automatically maintains a high-relevance cache. With comprehensive experiments on three retrieval datasets, our experimental results demonstrate that ARC reduces storage requirements to 0.015% of the original corpus while offering up to 79.8% has-answer rate and reducing average retrieval latency by 80%.

        "summary": "To foster trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (AI) within the European Union, the AI Act requires providers to mark and detect the outputs of their general-purpose models. The Article 50 and Recital 133 call for marking methods that are ''sufficiently reliable, interoperable, effective and robust''. Yet, the rapidly evolving and heterogeneous landscape of watermarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) makes it difficult to determine how these four standards can be translated into concrete and measurable evaluations. Our paper addresses this challenge, anchoring the normativity of European requirements in the multiplicity of watermarking techniques. Introducing clear and distinct concepts on LLM watermarking, our contribution is threefold. (1) Watermarking Categorisation: We propose an accessible taxonomy of watermarking methods according to the stage of the LLM lifecycle at which they are applied - before, during, or after training, and during next-token distribution or sampling. (2) Watermarking Evaluation: We interpret the EU AI Act's requirements by mapping each criterion with state-of-the-art evaluations on robustness and detectability of the watermark, and of quality of the LLM. Since interoperability remains largely untheorised in LLM watermarking research, we propose three normative dimensions to frame its assessment. (3) Watermarking Comparison: We compare current watermarking methods for LLMs against the operationalised European criteria and show that no approach yet satisfies all four standards. Encouraged by emerging empirical tests, we recommend further research into watermarking directly embedded within the low-level architecture of LLMs.",

Consequently, they evaluate isolated reasoning or problem-solving rather than decision-making under uncertainty. To address this, we introduce LiveTradeBench, a live trading environment for evaluating LLM agents in realistic and evolving markets. LiveTradeBench follows three design principles: (i) Live data streaming of market prices and news, eliminating dependence on offline backtesting and preventing information leakage while capturing real-time uncertainty; (ii) a portfolio-management abstraction that extends control from single-asset actions to multi-asset allocation, integrating risk management and cross-asset reasoning; and (iii) multi-market evaluation across structurally distinct environments--U.S. stocks and Polymarket prediction markets--differing in volatility, liquidity, and information flow. At each step, an agent observes prices, news, and its portfolio, then outputs percentage allocations that balance risk and return. Using LiveTradeBench, we run 50-day live evaluations of 21 LLMs across families. Results show that (1) high LMArena scores do not imply superior trading outcomes; (2) models display distinct portfolio styles reflecting risk appetite and reasoning dynamics; and (3) some LLMs effectively leverage live signals to adapt decisions. These findings expose a gap between static evaluation and real-world competence, motivating benchmarks that test sequential decision making and consistency under live uncertainty.",

This study uses a novel text-based approach to measure the idea-level diffusion of social science knowledge from the research domain to the journalism and policy-making domains. By doing so, we expand the detection of knowledge diffusion beyond the measurements of direct references. Our study focuses on media effects theories as key research ideas in the field of communication science. Using 72,703 documents (2000-2019) from three domains (i.e., research, journalism, and policy-making) that mention these ideas, we count the mentions of these ideas in each domain, estimate their domain-specific contexts, and track and compare differences across domains and over time. Overall, we find that diffusion patterns and dynamics vary considerably between ideas, with some ideas diffusing between other domains, while others do not. Based on the embedding regression approach, we compare contextualized meanings across domains and find that the distances between research and policy are typically larger than between research and journalism. We also find that ideas largely shift roles across domains - from being the theories themselves in research to sense-making in news to applied, administrative use in policy. Over time, we observe semantic convergence mainly for ideas that are practically oriented. Our results characterize the cross-domain diffusion patterns and dynamics of social science knowledge at the idea level, and we discuss the implications for measuring knowledge diffusion beyond citations.",

Existing research employs red teaming evaluations, utilizing multi-turn jailbreaks to identify potential vulnerabilities in LLMs. However, these approaches often lack exploration of successful dialogue trajectories within the attack space, and they tend to overlook the considerable overhead associated with the attack process. To address these limitations, this paper first introduces a theoretical model based on dynamically weighted graph topology, abstracting the multi-turn attack process as a path planning problem. Based on this framework, we propose ABC, an enhanced Artificial Bee Colony algorithm for multi-turn jailbreaks, featuring a collaborative search mechanism with employed, onlooker, and scout bees. This algorithm significantly improves the efficiency of optimal attack path search while substantially reducing the average number of queries required. Empirical evaluations on three open-source and two proprietary language models demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving attack success rates above 90\\% across the board, with a peak of 98\\% on GPT-3.5-Turbo, and outperforming existing baselines. Furthermore, it achieves comparable success with only 26 queries on average, significantly reducing red teaming overhead and highlighting its superior efficiency.",

To help minimize this gap, we develop a synthetic multi-turn conversational generation pipeline and steer responses toward our defined empathy patterns based on the context that more closely matches users' expectations. We then train empathetic expert adapters for context-specific empathy that specialize in varying empathy levels based on the recognized task. Our empirical results demonstrate a significant gap reduction of 72.66% between perceived and desired empathy with scores increasing by an average factor of 2.43 as measured by our metrics and reward models.

Queries and keys induce an effective metric on representation space, and attention acts as a discrete connection that implements parallel transport of value vectors across tokens. Stacked layers provide discrete time-slices through which token representations evolve on this curved manifold, while backpropagation plays the role of a least-action principle that shapes loss-minimizing trajectories in parameter space. If this analogy is correct, token embeddings should not traverse straight paths in feature space; instead, their layer-wise steps should bend and reorient as interactions mediated by embedding space curvature. To test this prediction, we design experiments that expose both the presence and the consequences of curvature: (i) we visualize a curvature landscape for a full paragraph, revealing how local turning angles vary across tokens and layers; (ii) we show through simulations that excess counts of sharp/flat angles and longer length-to-chord ratios are not explainable by dimensionality or chance; and (iii) inspired by Einstein's eclipse experiment, we probe deflection under controlled context edits, demonstrating measurable, meaning-consistent bends in embedding trajectories that confirm attention-induced curvature.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for post-training large reasoning models (LRMs) using policy-gradient methods such as GRPO. To stabilize training, these methods typically center trajectory rewards by subtracting the empirical mean for each prompt. Statistically, this centering acts as a control variate (or baseline), reducing the variance of the policy-gradient estimator. Typically, the mean reward is estimated using per-prompt empirical averages for each prompt in a batch. Drawing inspiration from Stein's paradox, we propose using shrinkage estimators that combine per-prompt and across-prompt means to improve the overall per-prompt mean estimation accuracy -- particularly in the low-generation regime typical of RLVR. Theoretically, we construct a shrinkage-based baseline that provably yields lower-variance policy-gradient estimators across algorithms. Our proposed baseline serves as a drop-in replacement for existing per-prompt mean baselines, requiring no additional hyper-parameters or computation. Empirically, shrinkage baselines consistently outperform standard empirical-mean baselines, leading to lower-variance gradient updates and improved training stability.",

        "summary": "Analog/mixed-signal circuits are key for interfacing electronics with the physical world. Their design, however, remains a largely handcrafted process, resulting in long and error-prone design cycles. While the recent rise of AI-based reinforcement learning and generative AI has created new techniques to automate this task, the need for many time-consuming simulations is a critical bottleneck hindering the overall efficiency. Furthermore, the lack of explainability of the resulting design solutions hampers widespread adoption of the tools. To address these issues, a novel agentic AI framework for sample-efficient and explainable analog circuit sizing is presented. It employs a multi-agent workflow where specialized Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents collaborate to interpret the circuit topology, to understand the design goals, and to iteratively refine the circuit's design parameters towards the target goals with human-interpretable reasoning. The adaptive simulation strategy creates an intelligent control that yields a high sample efficiency. The AnaFlow framework is demonstrated for two circuits of varying complexity and is able to complete the sizing task fully automatically, differently from pure Bayesian optimization and reinforcement learning approaches. The system learns from its optimization history to avoid past mistakes and to accelerate convergence. The inherent explainability makes this a powerful tool for analog design space exploration and a new paradigm in analog EDA, where AI agents serve as transparent design assistants.",

We introduce Behavior-Adaptive Q-Learning (BAQ), a framework designed to enable a smooth and reliable transition from offline to online RL. The key idea is to leverage an implicit behavioral model derived from offline data to provide a behavior-consistency signal during online fine-tuning. BAQ incorporates a dual-objective loss that (i) aligns the online policy toward the offline behavior when uncertainty is high, and (ii) gradually relaxes this constraint as more confident online experience is accumulated. This adaptive mechanism reduces error propagation from out-of-distribution estimates, stabilizes early online updates, and accelerates adaptation to new scenarios. Across standard benchmarks, BAQ consistently outperforms prior offline-to-online RL approaches, achieving faster recovery, improved robustness, and higher overall performance. Our results demonstrate that implicit behavior adaptation is a principled and practical solution for reliable real-world policy deployment.",

We argue that parametric recalibration functions based on logistic regression can be motivated from a simple theoretical setting for both binary and multiclass classification. This insight motivates the use of more expressive calibration methods beyond standard temperature scaling. For multi-class calibration however, a key challenge lies in the increasing number of parameters introduced by more complex models, often coupled with limited calibration data, which can lead to overfitting. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the resulting bias-variance tradeoff can be effectively managed by structured regularization, robust preprocessing and efficient optimization. The resulting methods lead to substantial gains over existing logistic-based calibration techniques. We provide efficient and easy-to-use open-source implementations of our methods, making them an attractive alternative to common temperature, vector, and matrix scaling implementations.",

This study proposes a machine learning-driven framework for (1) detecting malicious cyberattacks and (2) identifying faulty device anomalies, leveraging a dataset of 200,000 records. Eight machine learning models are evaluated across three learning approaches: supervised learning (XGBoost, K-Nearest Neighbors (K- NN)), semi-supervised learning (Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), Variational Autoencoders (VAE)), and unsupervised learning (One-Class Support Vector Machine (SVM), Isolation Forest, Graph Neural Networks (GNN), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Autoencoders). The comprehensive evaluation was conducted across multiple metrics like F1-score, precision, recall, accuracy, ROC-AUC, computational efficiency. XGBoost achieved 99\\% accuracy with minimal computational overhead (0.04s) for anomaly detection, while Isolation Forest balanced precision and recall effectively. LSTM Autoencoders underperformed with lower accuracy and higher latency. For attack detection, KNN achieved near-perfect precision, recall, and F1-score with the lowest computational cost (0.05s), followed by VAE at 97% accuracy. GAN showed the highest computational cost with lowest accuracy and ROC-AUC. These findings enhance IoT-enabled healthcare security through effective anomaly detection strategies.

        "summary": "Imitation learning traditionally requires complete state-action demonstrations from optimal or near-optimal experts. These requirements severely limit practical applicability, as many real-world scenarios provide only state observations without corresponding actions and expert performance is often suboptimal. In this paper we introduce a deep implicit imitation reinforcement learning framework that addresses both limitations by combining deep reinforcement learning with implicit imitation learning from observation-only datasets. Our main algorithm, Deep Implicit Imitation Q-Network (DIIQN), employs an action inference mechanism that reconstructs expert actions through online exploration and integrates a dynamic confidence mechanism that adaptively balances expert-guided and self-directed learning. This enables the agent to leverage expert guidance for accelerated training while maintaining capacity to surpass suboptimal expert performance. We further extend our framework with a Heterogeneous Actions DIIQN (HA-DIIQN) algorithm to tackle scenarios where expert and agent possess different action sets, a challenge previously unaddressed in the implicit imitation learning literature. HA-DIIQN introduces an infeasibility detection mechanism and a bridging procedure identifying alternative pathways connecting agent capabilities to expert guidance when direct action replication is impossible. Our experimental results demonstrate that DIIQN achieves up to 130% higher episodic returns compared to standard DQN, while consistently outperforming existing implicit imitation methods that cannot exceed expert performance. In heterogeneous action settings, HA-DIIQN learns up to 64% faster than baselines, leveraging expert datasets unusable by conventional approaches. Extensive parameter sensitivity analysis reveals the framework's robustness across varying dataset sizes and hyperparameter configurations.",

Q-learning algorithms struggle particularly with the curse of dimensionality, where the number of state-action pairs grows exponentially with problem size. While neural network-based approaches like Deep Q-Networks have shown success, recent tensor-based methods using low-rank decomposition offer more parameter-efficient alternatives. Building upon existing tensor-based methods, we propose Tensor-Efficient Q-Learning (TEQL), which enhances low-rank tensor decomposition via improved block coordinate descent on discretized state-action spaces, incorporating novel exploration and regularization mechanisms. The key innovation is an exploration strategy that combines approximation error with visit count-based upper confidence bound to prioritize actions with high uncertainty, avoiding wasteful random exploration. Additionally, we incorporate a frequency-based penalty term in the objective function to encourage exploration of less-visited state-action pairs and reduce overfitting to frequently visited regions. Empirical results on classic control tasks demonstrate that TEQL outperforms conventional matrix-based methods and deep RL approaches in both sample efficiency and total rewards, making it suitable for resource-constrained applications, such as space and healthcare where sampling costs are high.",

We address this by training within the laws of physics rather than beside them. Our framework, called Constraint-Projected Learning (CPL), keeps every update physically admissible by projecting network outputs onto the intersection of constraint sets defined by conservation, Rankine-Hugoniot balance, entropy, and positivity. The projection is differentiable and adds only about 10% computational overhead, making it fully compatible with back-propagation. We further stabilize training with total-variation damping (TVD) to suppress small oscillations and a rollout curriculum that enforces consistency over long prediction horizons. Together, these mechanisms eliminate both hard and soft violations: conservation holds at machine precision, total-variation growth vanishes, and entropy and error remain bounded. On Burgers and Euler systems, CPL produces stable, physically lawful solutions without loss of accuracy. Instead of hoping neural solvers will respect physics, CPL makes that behavior an intrinsic property of the learning process.",

A recently emerging explanation is that learning algorithms are successful in practice because they converge to flat minima, which have been consistently associated with improved generalization performance. In this work, we study the link between flat minima and generalization in the canonical setting of stochastic convex optimization with a non-negative, $\\beta$-smooth objective. Our first finding is that, even in this fundamental and well-studied setting, flat empirical minima may incur trivial $\\Omega(1)$ population risk while sharp minima generalizes optimally. Then, we show that this poor generalization behavior extends to two natural ''sharpness-aware'' algorithms originally proposed by Foret et al. (2021), designed to bias optimization toward flat solutions: Sharpness-Aware Gradient Descent (SA-GD) and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM). For SA-GD, which performs gradient steps on the maximal loss in a predefined neighborhood, we prove that while it successfully converges to a flat minimum at a fast rate, the population risk of the solution can still be as large as $\\Omega(1)$, indicating that even flat minima found algorithmically using a sharpness-aware gradient method might generalize poorly. For SAM, a computationally efficient approximation of SA-GD based on normalized ascent steps, we show that although it minimizes the empirical loss, it may converge to a sharp minimum and also incur population risk $\\Omega(1)$. Finally, we establish population risk upper bounds for both SA-GD and SAM using algorithmic stability techniques.",

The DCT-based parameterization provides a structured and decorrelated representation that reveals the functional role of each neuron and allows direct identification of redundant components. Leveraging this property, we propose an efficient pruning strategy that removes unnecessary DCT coefficients with negligible or no loss in performance. Experimental results across classification and implicit neural representation tasks confirm that ENNs achieve state-of-the-art accuracy while maintaining a low number of parameters. Furthermore, up to 40% of the activation coefficients can be safely pruned, thanks to the orthogonality and bounded nature of the DCT basis. Overall, these findings demonstrate that the ENN framework offers a principled integration of signal processing concepts into neural network design, achieving a balanced trade-off between expressiveness, compactness, and interpretability.",

        "summary": "Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a scalable alternative to Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) by eliminating the learned critic and instead estimating advantages through group-relative comparisons of trajectories. This simplification raises fundamental questions about the necessity of learned baselines in policy-gradient methods. We present the first systematic study of GRPO in classical single-task reinforcement learning environments, spanning discrete and continuous control tasks. Through controlled ablations isolating baselines, discounting, and group sampling, we reveal three key findings: (1) learned critics remain essential for long-horizon tasks: all critic-free baselines underperform PPO except in short-horizon environments like CartPole where episodic returns can be effective; (2) GRPO benefits from high discount factors (gamma = 0.99) except in HalfCheetah, where lack of early termination favors moderate discounting (gamma = 0.9); (3) smaller group sizes outperform larger ones, suggesting limitations in batch-based grouping strategies that mix unrelated episodes. These results reveal both the limitations of critic-free methods in classical control and the specific conditions where they remain viable alternatives to learned value functions.",

This question has become critical as classical scaling laws suggesting ``more is more'' (Sun et al., 2025) are challenged by methods like LIMO (``less is more'') and s1 (Ye et al., 2025; Muenighoff et al., 2025), which achieve superior performance with small, aggressively curated datasets. Here, we study data curation strategies where an imperfect oracle selects the training examples according to their difficulty and correctness. Our results provide exact scaling law curves for test error under both label-agnostic and label-aware curation rules, revealing when and why keeping only a subset of data can improve generalization. In contrast to classical scaling laws, we show that under certain conditions, small curated datasets can outperform full datasets, and we provide analytical conditions for this by deriving precise phase transition curves tied to data size and quality. We validate these theoretical claims with empirical results on ImageNet, confirming our predictions about when curation improves accuracy and can even mitigate model collapse. Furthermore, our framework provides a principled explanation for the contradictory curation strategies recently observed in LLM mathematical reasoning.",

Most existing models that process polysomnography data rely on a fixed subset of modalities or channels and therefore neglect to fully exploit its inherently multimodal nature. We address this limitation by introducing NAP (Neural Aggregator of Predictions), an attention-based model which learns to combine multiple prediction streams using a tri-axial attention mechanism that captures temporal, spatial, and predictor-level dependencies. NAP is trained to adapt to different input dimensions. By aggregating outputs from frozen, pretrained single-channel models, NAP consistently outperforms individual predictors and simple ensembles, achieving state-of-the-art zero-shot generalization across multiple datasets. While demonstrated in the context of automated sleep staging from polysomnography, the proposed approach could be extended to other multimodal physiological applications.",

To overcome this tradeoff, we introduce POEMS: Product Of Experts for Interpretable Multiomics Integration using Sparse Decoding, an unsupervised probabilistic framework that preserves predictive performance while providing interpretability. POEMS provides interpretability without linearizing any part of the network by 1) mapping features to latent factors using sparse connections, which directly translates to biomarker discovery, 2) allowing for cross-omic associations through a shared latent space using product of experts model, and 3) reporting contributions of each omic by a gating network that adaptively computes their influence in the representation learning. Additionally, we present an efficient sparse decoder. In a cancer subtyping case study, POEMS achieves competitive clustering and classification performance while offering our novel set of interpretations, demonstrating that biomarker based insight and predictive accuracy can coexist in multiomics representation learning.",

Recent studies of data markets with externalities capture buyer interactions but do not yield a simultaneous and symmetric mechanism across data sellers, model producers, and model buyers. We propose a unified data-model coupled market that treats dataset and model trading as a single system. A supply-side mapping transforms dataset payments into buyer-visible model quotations, while a demand-side mapping propagates buyer prices back to datasets through Shapley-based allocation. Together, they form a closed loop that links four interactions: supply-demand propagation in both directions and mutual coupling among buyers and among sellers. We prove that the joint operator is a standard interference function (SIF), guaranteeing existence, uniqueness, and global convergence of equilibrium prices. Experiments demonstrate efficient convergence and improved fairness compared with broker-centric and one-sided baselines.

        "summary": "In this study, a modular, data-free pipeline for multi-label intention recognition is proposed for agentic AI applications in transportation. Unlike traditional intent recognition systems that depend on large, annotated corpora and often struggle with fine-grained, multi-label discrimination, our approach eliminates the need for costly data collection while enhancing the accuracy of multi-label intention understanding. Specifically, the overall pipeline, named DMTC, consists of three steps: 1) using prompt engineering to guide large language models (LLMs) to generate diverse synthetic queries in different transport scenarios; 2) encoding each textual query with a Sentence-T5 model to obtain compact semantic embeddings; 3) training a lightweight classifier using a novel online focal-contrastive (OFC) loss that emphasizes hard samples and maximizes inter-class separability. The applicability of the proposed pipeline is demonstrated in an agentic AI application in the maritime transportation context. Extensive experiments show that DMTC achieves a Hamming loss of 5.35% and an AUC of 95.92%, outperforming state-of-the-art multi-label classifiers and recent end-to-end SOTA LLM-based baselines. Further analysis reveals that Sentence-T5 embeddings improve subset accuracy by at least 3.29% over alternative encoders, and integrating the OFC loss yields an additional 0.98% gain compared to standard contrastive objectives. In conclusion, our system seamlessly routes user queries to task-specific modules (e.g., ETA information, traffic risk evaluation, and other typical scenarios in the transportation domain), laying the groundwork for fully autonomous, intention-aware agents without costly manual labelling.",

Rather than relying on a single \"best\" tree, Rashomon sets-trees with similar performance but varying structures-can be used to enhance variable importance analysis, enrich explanations, and enable users to choose simpler trees or those that satisfy stakeholder preferences (e.g., fairness) without hard-coding such criteria into the objective function. However, because finding the optimal tree is NP-hard, enumerating the Rashomon set is inherently challenging. Therefore, we introduce SORTD, a novel framework that improves scalability and enumerates trees in the Rashomon set in order of the objective value, thus offering anytime behavior. Our experiments show that SORTD reduces runtime by up to two orders of magnitude compared with the state of the art. Moreover, SORTD can compute Rashomon sets for any separable and totally ordered objective and supports post-evaluating the set using other separable (and partially ordered) objectives. Together, these advances make exploring Rashomon sets more practical in real-world applications.",

A common strategy is iterative null-space projection which as of now has only been explored for linear models or embeddings such as obtained by a non-linear encoder. We improve on this by generalizing to kernel methods, significantly extending the scope. This yields a model and fairness-score agnostic method for kernel embeddings applicable to continuous protected attributes.

The microservice call chain is abstracted as a directed graph, where multidimensional features of nodes and edges are used to construct a service topology representation, and graph convolution is applied to aggregate features across nodes and model dependencies, capturing complex structural relationships among services. On this basis, gated recurrent units are introduced to model the temporal evolution of call chains, and multi-layer stacking and concatenation operations are used to jointly obtain structural and temporal representations, improving the ability to identify anomaly patterns. Furthermore, anomaly scoring functions at both the node and path levels are defined to achieve unified modeling from local anomaly detection to global call chain tracing, which enables the identification of abnormal service nodes and the reconstruction of potential anomaly propagation paths. Sensitivity experiments are then designed from multiple dimensions, including hyperparameters, environmental disturbances, and data distribution, to evaluate the framework, and results show that it outperforms baseline methods in key metrics such as AUC, ACC, Recall, and F1-Score, maintaining high accuracy and stability under dynamic topologies and complex environments.

To study the internal mechanism of EM, we reformulate and decouple the classical EM into two parts with opposite effects: cluster aggregation driving factor (CADF) rewards dominant classes and prompts a peaked output distribution, while gradient mitigation calibrator (GMC) penalizes high-confidence classes based on predicted probabilities. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of classical EM caused by its coupled formulation: 1) reward collapse impedes the contribution of high-certainty samples in the learning process, and 2) easy-class bias induces misalignment between output distribution and label distribution. To address these issues, we propose Adaptive Decoupled Entropy Minimization (AdaDEM), which normalizes the reward brought from CADF and employs a marginal entropy calibrator (MEC) to replace GMC.

Additionally, we adopt a prompt-only fine-tuning strategy that significantly reduces spatiotemporal complexity during transfer. We validate GMoPE through extensive experiments under various pretraining strategies and multiple downstream tasks. Results show that GMoPE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves performance comparable to full parameter fine-tuning-while requiring only a fraction of the adaptation overhead. Our work provides a principled and scalable framework for advancing generalizable and efficient graph foundation models.",

Designing effective adaptation policies, however, depends on managing the uncertainty of long-term climate impacts. Meanwhile, such policies can feature important normative choices that are not always made explicit. We propose that Reinforcement Learning (RL) can be a useful tool to both identify adaptation pathways under uncertain conditions while it also allows for the explicit modelling (and consequent comparison) of different adaptation priorities (e.g. economic vs. wellbeing). We use an Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) to link together a rainfall and flood model, and compute the impacts of flooding in terms of quality of life (QoL), transportation, and infrastructure damage. Our results show that models prioritising QoL over economic impacts results in more adaptation spending as well as a more even distribution of spending over the study area, highlighting the extent to which such normative assumptions can alter adaptation policy.

        "summary": "Solving inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is central to science and engineering, yet remains challenging when measurements are sparse, noisy, or when the underlying coefficients are high-dimensional or discontinuous. Existing deep learning approaches either require extensive labeled datasets or are limited to specific measurement types, often leading to failure in such regimes and restricting their practical applicability. Here, a novel generative neural operator framework, IGNO, is introduced to overcome these limitations. IGNO unifies the solution of inverse problems from both point measurements and operator-valued data without labeled training pairs. This framework encodes high-dimensional, potentially discontinuous coefficient fields into a low-dimensional latent space, which drives neural operator decoders to reconstruct both coefficients and PDE solutions. Training relies purely on physics constraints through PDE residuals, while inversion proceeds via efficient gradient-based optimization in latent space, accelerated by an a priori normalizing flow model. Across a diverse set of challenging inverse problems, including recovery of discontinuous coefficients from solution-based measurements and the EIT problem with operator-based measurements, IGNO consistently achieves accurate, stable, and scalable inversion even under severe noise. It consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art method under varying noise levels and demonstrates strong generalization to out-of-distribution targets. These results establish IGNO as a unified and powerful framework for tackling challenging inverse problems across computational science domains.",

Despite growing emphasis on data-centric AI, most datasets are still gathered in an open-loop manner which accumulates redundant samples without feedback from the current coverage.

To address this, this paper introduces \\ac{FCDC}, a paradigm that formulates data collection as a closed-loop control problem. \\ac{FCDC} continuously approximates the state of the collected data distribution using an online probabilistic model and adaptively regulates sample retention using based on feedback signals such as likelihood and Mahalanobis distance. Through this feedback mechanism, the system dynamically balances exploration and exploitation, maintains dataset diversity, and prevents redundancy from accumulating over time. Besides showcasing the controllability of \\ac{FCDC} on a synthetic dataset, experiments on a real data stream show that \\ac{FCDC} produces more balanced datasets by $\\SI{25.9}{\\percent}$ while reducing data storage by $\\SI{39.8}{\\percent}$.

This study proposes a VAE-MLP model framework where an MLP-based classifier is trained on 8-dimensional latent vectors derived from the high-dimensional train data using the encoder component of a pretrained variational autoencoder (VAE). Two widely used quantization strategies--Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) and Post-Training Quantization (PTQ)--are then systematically evaluated in terms of their impact on detection performance, storage efficiency, and inference latency using two benchmark IoT botnet datasets--N-BaIoT and CICIoT2022. The results revealed that, with respect to detection accuracy, the QAT strategy experienced a more noticeable decline,whereas PTQ incurred only a marginal reduction compared to the original unquantized model. Furthermore, PTQ yielded a 6x speedup and 21x reduction in size, while QAT achieved a 3x speedup and 24x compression, demonstrating the practicality of quantization for device-level IoT botnet detection.",

It is essential to develop multimodal learning methods to aggregate various information from multiple modalities. The main challenge is how to appropriately align and fuse the representations of different modalities into a joint distribution. Existing methods mainly rely on concatenation or the Kronecker product, oversimplifying the interaction structure between modalities and indicating a need to model more complex interactions. Additionally, the joint distribution of latent representations with higher-order interactions is underexplored. Copula is a powerful statistical structure for modelling the interactions among variables, as it naturally bridges the joint distribution and marginal distributions of multiple variables. We propose a novel copula-driven multimodal learning framework, which focuses on learning the joint distribution of various modalities to capture the complex interactions among them. The key idea is to interpret the copula model as a tool to align the marginal distributions of the modalities efficiently. By assuming a Gaussian mixture distribution for each modality and a copula model on the joint distribution, our model can generate accurate representations for missing modalities. Extensive experiments on public MIMIC datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors. The code is available at https://github.com/HKU-MedAI/CMCM.",

In this work, we propose a novel linear attention mechanism designed to overcome these limitations. Our approach is grounded in a theoretical demonstration that entropy, as a strictly concave function on the probability simplex, implies that distributions with aligned probability rankings and similar entropy values exhibit structural resemblance. Building on this insight, we develop an efficient approximation algorithm that computes the entropy of dot-product-derived distributions with only linear complexity, enabling the implementation of a linear attention mechanism based on entropy equality. Through rigorous analysis, we reveal that the effectiveness of attention in spatio-temporal time series modeling may not primarily stem from the non-linearity of softmax but rather from the attainment of a moderate and well-balanced weight distribution. Extensive experiments on four spatio-temporal datasets validate our method, demonstrating competitive or superior forecasting performance while achieving substantial reductions in both memory usage and computational time.",

However, current methods often overlook the periodic nature of learned skills, focusing instead on increasing the mutual dependence between states and skills or maximizing the distance traveled in latent space. Considering that many robotic tasks -- particularly those involving locomotion -- require periodic behaviors across varying timescales, the ability to discover diverse periodic skills is essential. Motivated by this, we propose Periodic Skill Discovery (PSD), a framework that discovers periodic behaviors in an unsupervised manner. The key idea of PSD is to train an encoder that maps states to a circular latent space, thereby naturally encoding periodicity in the latent representation. By capturing temporal distance, PSD can effectively learn skills with diverse periods in complex robotic tasks, even with pixel-based observations. We further show that these learned skills achieve high performance on downstream tasks such as hurdling. Moreover, integrating PSD with an existing skill discovery method offers more diverse behaviors, thus broadening the agent's repertoire.

It estimates dynamic causal influences by analyzing datapoint-wise prediction errors induced by temporal perturbations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UnCLe not only outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on static causal discovery benchmarks but, more importantly, exhibits a unique capability to accurately capture and represent evolving temporal causality in both synthetic and real-world dynamic systems (e.g., human motion).

Yet, existing methods are limited to specific systems while failing to generalize to evolving anomaly patterns over time. In contrast, pretrained Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have recently demonstrated strong generalization and zero-shot forecasting capabilities. However, their potential remains untapped for anomaly prediction, a task fundamentally different from forecasting normal behavior. Thus, we present Forecast2Anomaly (F2A), a novel framework that empowers TSFMs with anomaly prediction abilities through two key innovations. First, we propose a joint forecast-anomaly loss that fine-tunes TSFMs to accurately forecast future signals even at anomalous time points. Second, we introduce a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module that retrieves historically relevant horizons and conditions predictions on them. This component dynamically adapts to distributional shifts at inference time, enabling F2A to track evolving anomalies without requiring model updates. By combining targeted fine-tuning with dynamic retrieval, F2A bridges the gap between robust TSFM zero-shot forecasting and zero-shot anomaly prediction. Extensive experiments across 16 diverse datasets and multiple TSFM backbones show that F2A consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a scalable, zero-shot anomaly prediction solution for real-world applications.",

However, conventional approaches typically rely on prior knowledge of the target domain or require model retraining, limiting their practicality in dynamic or resource-constrained environments. Recent test-time adaptation methods based on batch normalization statistic updates allow for unsupervised adaptation, but they often fail to capture complex activation distributions and are constrained to specific normalization layers. We propose Adaptive Quantile Recalibration (AQR), a test-time adaptation technique that modifies pre-activation distributions by aligning quantiles on a channel-wise basis. AQR captures the full shape of activation distributions and generalizes across architectures employing BatchNorm, GroupNorm, or LayerNorm. To address the challenge of estimating distribution tails under varying batch sizes, AQR incorporates a robust tail calibration strategy that improves stability and precision. Our method leverages source-domain statistics computed at training time, enabling unsupervised adaptation without retraining models. Experiments on CIFAR-10-C, CIFAR-100-C, and ImageNet-C across multiple architectures demonstrate that AQR achieves robust adaptation across diverse settings, outperforming existing test-time adaptation baselines.

Our method minimizes a novel FPE residual loss over the mixed manifold of CDR geometries (R^3 x SO(3)), compelling locally-learned denoising scores to assemble into a globally coherent probability flow. This physics-informed regularizer is synergistically integrated with deep biological priors within a state-of-the-art SE(3)-equivariant diffusion framework. Rigorous evaluation on the RAbD benchmark confirms that FP-AbDiff establishes a new state-of-the-art. In de novo CDR-H3 design, it achieves a mean Root Mean Square Deviation of 0.99 Å when superposing on the variable region, a 25% improvement over the previous state-of-the-art model, AbX, and the highest reported Contact Amino Acid Recovery of 39.91%. This superiority is underscored in the more challenging six-CDR co-design task, where our model delivers consistently superior geometric precision, cutting the average full-chain Root Mean Square Deviation by ~15%, and crucially, achieves the highest full-chain Amino Acid Recovery on the functionally dominant CDR-H3 loop (45.67%).

The field of text analytics also experienced a massive transformation in this trend of monopolizing methodology.

This paper primarily discusses the effectiveness of classical machine learning techniques in text analytics with CTF-IDF and a faster IRLBA algorithm for dimensionality reduction. The introduction of both of these techniques in the conventional text analytics pipeline ensures a more efficient, faster, and less computationally intensive application when compared with deep learning methodology regarding carbon footprint, with minor compromise in accuracy. The experimental results also exhibit a manifold of reduction in time complexity and improvement of model accuracy for the classical machine learning methods discussed further in this paper.",

        "summary": "Modern artificial intelligence has revolutionized our ability to extract rich and versatile data representations across scientific disciplines. Yet, the statistical properties of these representations remain poorly controlled, causing misspecified anomaly detection (AD) methods to falter. Weak or rare signals can remain hidden within the apparent regularity of normal data, creating a gap in our ability to detect and interpret anomalies. We examine this gap and identify a set of structural desiderata for detection methods operating under minimal prior information: sparsity, to enforce parsimony; locality, to preserve geometric sensitivity; and competition, to promote efficient allocation of model capacity. These principles define a class of self-organizing local kernels that adaptively partition the representation space around regions of statistical imbalance. As an instantiation of these principles, we introduce SparKer, a sparse ensemble of Gaussian kernels trained within a semi-supervised Neyman--Pearson framework to locally model the likelihood ratio between a sample that may contain anomalies and a nominal, anomaly-free reference. We provide theoretical insights into the mechanisms that drive detection and self-organization in the proposed model, and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on realistic high-dimensional problems of scientific discovery, open-world novelty detection, intrusion detection, and generative-model validation. Our applications span both the natural- and computer-science domains. We demonstrate that ensembles containing only a handful of kernels can identify statistically significant anomalous locations within representation spaces of thousands of dimensions, underscoring both the interpretability, efficiency and scalability of the proposed approach.",

        "summary": "Online learning to rank (OLTR) studies how to recommend a short ranked list of items from a large pool and improves future rankings based on user clicks. This setting is commonly modeled as cascading bandits, where the objective is to maximize the likelihood that the user clicks on at least one of the presented items across as many timesteps as possible. However, such systems are vulnerable to click fraud and other manipulations (i.e., corruption), where bots or paid click farms inject corrupted feedback that misleads the learning process and degrades user experience. In this paper, we propose MSUCB, a robust algorithm that incorporates a novel mean-of-medians estimator, which to our knowledge is applied to bandits with corruption setting for the first time. This estimator behaves like a standard mean in the absence of corruption, so no cost is paid for robustness. Under corruption, the median step filters out outliers and corrupted samples, keeping the estimate close to its true value. Updating this estimate at every round further accelerates empirical convergence in experiments. Hence, MSUCB achieves optimal logarithmic regret in the absence of corruption and degrades gracefully under corruptions, with regret increasing only by an additive term tied to the total corruption. Comprehensive and extensive experiments on real-world datasets further demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms prior methods while maintaining strong robustness. In particular, it achieves a \\(97.35\\%\\) and a \\(91.60\\%\\) regret improvement over two state-of-the-art methods.",

        "summary": "In the era of AI-driven science and engineering, we often want to design discrete objects in silico according to user-specified properties. For example, we may wish to design a protein to bind its target, arrange components within a circuit to minimize latency, or find materials with certain properties. Given a property predictive model, in silico design typically involves training a generative model over the design space (e.g., protein sequence space) to concentrate on designs with the desired properties. Distributional optimization -- which can be formalized as an estimation of distribution algorithm or as reinforcement learning policy optimization -- finds the generative model that maximizes an objective function in expectation. Optimizing a distribution over discrete-valued designs is in general challenging because of the combinatorial nature of the design space. However, many property predictors in scientific applications are decomposable in the sense that they can be factorized over design variables in a way that could in principle enable more effective optimization. For example, amino acids at a catalytic site of a protein may only loosely interact with amino acids of the rest of the protein to achieve maximal catalytic activity. Current distributional optimization algorithms are unable to make use of such decomposability structure. Herein, we propose and demonstrate use of a new distributional optimization algorithm, Decomposition-Aware Distributional Optimization (DADO), that can leverage any decomposability defined by a junction tree on the design variables, to make optimization more efficient. At its core, DADO employs a soft-factorized \"search distribution\" -- a learned generative model -- for efficient navigation of the search space, invoking graph message-passing to coordinate optimization across linked factors.",

Sensorless monitoring -- machine learning models that predict the internal conditions of the containers using exogenous factors -- shows promise as an alternative to monitoring using sensors. However, it does not incorporate telemetry information and correct for systematic errors, causing the predictions to differ significantly from the live data and confusing the users. In this paper, we introduce the residual correction method, a general framework for correcting for systematic biases in sensorless models after observing live telemetry data. We call this class of models ``adaptive-sensorless'' monitoring. We train and evaluate adaptive-sensorless models on the 3.48 million data points -- the largest dataset of container sensor readings ever used in academic research -- and show that they produce consistent improvements over the baseline sensorless models. When evaluated on the holdout set of the simulated data, they achieve average mean absolute errors (MAEs) of 2.24 $\\sim$ 2.31$^\\circ$C (vs 2.43$^\\circ$C by sensorless) for temperature and 5.72 $\\sim$ 7.09% for relative humidity (vs 7.99% by sensorless) and average root mean-squared errors (RMSEs) of 3.19 $\\sim$ 3.26$^\\circ$C for temperature (vs 3.38$^\\circ$C by sensorless) and 7.70 $\\sim$ 9.12% for relative humidity (vs 10.0% by sensorless).

        "summary": "Metamaterials are engineered materials composed of specially designed unit cells that exhibit extraordinary properties beyond those of natural materials. Complex engineering tasks often require heterogeneous unit cells to accommodate spatially varying property requirements. However, designing heterogeneous metamaterials poses significant challenges due to the enormous design space and strict compatibility requirements between neighboring cells. Traditional concurrent multiscale design methods require solving an expensive optimization problem for each unit cell and often suffer from discontinuities at cell boundaries. On the other hand, data-driven approaches that assemble structures from a fixed library of microstructures are limited by the dataset and require additional post-processing to ensure seamless connections. In this work, we propose a neural network-based metamaterial design framework that learns a continuous two-scale representation of the structure, thereby jointly addressing these challenges. Central to our framework is a multiscale neural representation in which the neural network takes both global (macroscale) and local (microscale) coordinates as inputs, outputting an implicit field that represents multiscale structures with compatible unit cell geometries across the domain, without the need for a predefined dataset. We use a compatibility loss term during training to enforce connectivity between adjacent unit cells. Once trained, the network can produce metamaterial designs at arbitrarily high resolution, hence enabling infinite upsampling for fabrication or simulation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on mechanical metamaterial design, negative Poisson's ratio, and mechanical cloaking problems with potential applications in robotics, bioengineering, and aerospace.",

Specifically, we develop two novel algorithms that incorporate the expected gain from learning the value of information into Bootstrapped DQN. Our methods use value of information estimates to measure the discrepancies of opinions among distinct network heads, and drive exploration towards areas with the most potential.

In particular, UserAlign builds on the theoretical framework of best-arm identification in logistic bandits and selects a personalized response from a fixed pool of the model's generated responses. The key idea is to consider the user's feedback consistent and noise-free, and incorporate it into the theoretical framework to identify the best response quickly.

        "summary": "A common challenge for decision makers is selecting actions whose rewards are unknown and evolve over time based on prior policies. For instance, repeated use may reduce an action's effectiveness (habituation), while inactivity may restore it (recovery). These nonstationarities are captured by the Reducing or Gaining Unknown Efficacy (ROGUE) bandit framework, which models real-world settings such as behavioral health interventions. While existing algorithms can compute sublinear regret policies to optimize these settings, they may not provide sufficient exploration due to overemphasis on exploitation, limiting the ability to estimate population-level effects. This is a challenge of particular interest in micro-randomized trials (MRTs) that aid researchers in developing just-in-time adaptive interventions that have population-level effects while still providing personalized recommendations to individuals. In this paper, we first develop ROGUE-TS, a Thompson Sampling algorithm tailored to the ROGUE framework, and provide theoretical guarantees of sublinear regret. We then introduce a probability clipping procedure to balance personalization and population-level learning, with quantified trade-off that balances regret and minimum exploration probability. Validation on two MRT datasets concerning physical activity promotion and bipolar disorder treatment shows that our methods both achieve lower regret than existing approaches and maintain high statistical power through the clipping procedure without significantly increasing regret. This enables reliable detection of treatment effects while accounting for individual behavioral dynamics. For researchers designing MRTs, our framework offers practical guidance on balancing personalization with statistical validity.",

Although machine learning models have advanced HAR, they are increasingly susceptible to data poisoning attacks that compromise the data integrity and reliability of these systems. Conventional approaches to defending against such attacks often require extensive task-specific training with large, labeled datasets, which limits adaptability in dynamic IoT environments.

Specifically, a model was pre-trained on 1,280 public tasks for 700k+ optimizer steps over 48 hours on 4xH100 SXM GPUs to obtain a ~10% score on the public evaluation set. That model was then post-trained in just 12,500 gradient steps during the competition to reach a score of 6.67% on semi-private evaluation tasks. Notably, such post-training performance is achieved by full-fine tuning of the tiny model, not LoRA fine-tuning or fine-tuning of task embeddings alone.",

We reframe group formation as a core challenge in GRSs and propose DeepForm (Stochastic Deep Graph Clustering for Practical Group Formation), a framework designed to meet three key operational requirements: (1) the incorporation of high-order user information, (2) real-time group formation, and (3) dynamic adjustment of the number of groups. DeepForm employs a lightweight GCN architecture that effectively captures high-order structural signals. Stochastic cluster learning enables adaptive group reconfiguration without retraining, while contrastive learning refines groups under dynamic conditions. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that DeepForm achieves superior group formation quality, efficiency, and recommendation accuracy compared with various baselines.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.",

        "summary": "We study batched nonparametric contextual bandits under a margin condition when the margin parameter $\\alpha$ is unknown. To capture the statistical price of this ignorance, we introduce the regret inflation criterion, defined as the ratio between the regret of an adaptive algorithm and that of an oracle knowing $\\alpha$. We show that the optimal regret inflation grows polynomial with the horizon $T$, with exponent precisely given by the value of a convex optimization problem involving the dimension, smoothness, and batch budget. Moreover, the minimizers of this optimization problem directly prescribe the batch allocation and exploration strategy of a rate-optimal algorithm. Building on this principle, we develop RoBIN (RObust batched algorithm with adaptive BINning), which achieves the optimal regret inflation up to logarithmic factors. These results reveal a new adaptivity barrier: under batching, adaptation to an unknown margin parameter inevitably incurs a polynomial penalty, sharply characterized by a variational problem. Remarkably, this barrier vanishes when the number of batches exceeds $\\log \\log T$; with only a doubly logarithmic number of updates, one can recover the oracle regret rate up to polylogarithmic factors.",

While deep learning offers a path to automation, centralized training models conflict with data governance regulations and neglect the diagnostic importance of multi-scale analysis. In this work, we propose a scalable, privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) framework for CRC histopathological grading that integrates multi-scale feature learning within a distributed training paradigm. Our approach employs a dual-stream ResNetRS50 backbone to concurrently capture fine-grained nuclear detail and broader tissue-level context. This architecture is integrated into a robust FL system stabilized using FedProx to mitigate client drift across heterogeneous data distributions from multiple hospitals. Extensive evaluation on the CRC-HGD dataset demonstrates that our framework achieves an overall accuracy of 83.5%, outperforming a comparable centralized model (81.6%). Crucially, the system excels in identifying the most aggressive Grade III tumors with a high recall of 87.5%, a key clinical priority to prevent dangerous false negatives. Performance further improves with higher magnification, reaching 88.0% accuracy at 40x. These results validate that our federated multi-scale approach not only preserves patient privacy but also enhances model performance and generalization. The proposed modular pipeline, with built-in preprocessing, checkpointing, and error handling, establishes a foundational step toward deployable, privacy-aware clinical AI for digital pathology.",

We show an equivalence between properties that are efficiently testable from few samples and properties with structured symmetry, which depend only on the function's average values on parts of a low-complexity partition of the domain. Without the efficiency constraint, a similar characterization in terms of unstructured symmetry was obtained by Blais and Yoshida (2019). Our main technical tool is supersimulation, which builds on methods from the algorithmic fairness literature to approximate arbitrarily complex functions by small-circuit simulators that fool significantly larger distinguishers. We extend the characterization along other axes as well. We show that allowing parts to overlap exponentially reduces their required number, broadening the scope of the construction from properties testable with $O(\\log n)$ samples to properties testable with $O(n)$ samples. For larger sample sizes, we show that any efficient tester is essentially checking for indistinguishability from a bounded collection of small circuits, in the spirit of a characterization of testable graph properties. Finally, we show that our results for Boolean function testing generalize to high-entropy distribution testing on arbitrary domains.",

Our analysis relies on halo catalogs from the Big Sobol Sequence(BSQ) simulations at redshift $z=0.5$, employing a likelihood-free inference framework implemented via neural posterior estimation. At the fiducial cosmology of the Quijote simulations $(\\Omega_{m}=0.3175,\\,\\sigma_{8}=0.834)$, and for the smoothing scale $R=15\\,h^{-1}$Mpc, we find that the CMD yields tighter forecasts for $(\\Omega_{m}},\\,\\sigma_{8})$ than the zeroth- to third-order MFs components, improving the constraint precision by ${\\sim}(44\\%,\\,52\\%)$, ${\\sim}(30\\%,\\,45\\%)$, ${\\sim}(27\\%,\\,17\\%)$, and ${\\sim}(26\\%,\\,17\\%)$, respectively. A joint configuration combining the MFs and CMD further enhances the precision by approximately ${\\sim}27\\%$ compared to the standard MFs alone, highlighting the complementary anisotropy-sensitive information captured by the CMD in contrast to the scalar morphological content encapsulated by the MFs. We further extend the forecasting analysis to a continuous range of cosmological parameter values and multiple smoothing scales.

        "summary": "Beamforming has significance for enhancing spectral efficiency and mitigating interference in multi-antenna wireless systems, facilitating spatial multiplexing and diversity in dense and high mobility scenarios. Traditional beamforming techniques such as zero-forcing beamforming (ZFBF) and minimum mean square error (MMSE) beamforming experience performance deterioration under adverse channel conditions. Deep learning-based beamforming offers an alternative with nonlinear mappings from channel state information (CSI) to beamforming weights by improving robustness against dynamic channel environments. Transformer-based models are particularly effective due to their ability to model long-range dependencies across time and frequency. However, their quadratic attention complexity limits scalability in large OFDM grids. Recent studies address this issue through sparse attention mechanisms that reduce complexity while maintaining expressiveness, yet often employ patterns that disregard channel dynamics, as they are not specifically designed for wireless communication scenarios. In this work, we propose a Doppler-aware Sparse Neural Network Beamforming (Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF) model that incorporates a channel-adaptive sparse attention mechanism in a multi-user single-input multiple-output (MU-SIMO) setting. The proposed sparsity structure is configurable along 2D time-frequency axes based on channel dynamics and is theoretically proven to ensure full connectivity within p hops, where p is the number of attention heads. Simulation results under urban macro (UMa) channel conditions show that Doppler-aware Sparse NNBF significantly outperforms both a fixed-pattern baseline, referred to as Standard Sparse NNBF, and conventional beamforming techniques ZFBF and MMSE beamforming in high mobility scenarios, while maintaining structured sparsity with a controlled number of attended keys per query.",

CLAX addresses this gap by replacing EM-based optimization with direct gradient-based optimization in a numerically stable manner. The framework's modular design enables the integration of any component, from embeddings and deep networks to custom modules, into classic click models for end-to-end optimization. We demonstrate CLAX's efficiency by running experiments on the full Baidu-ULTR dataset comprising over a billion user sessions in $\\approx$ 2 hours on a single GPU, orders of magnitude faster than traditional EM approaches. CLAX implements ten classic click models, serving both industry practitioners seeking to understand user behavior and improve ranking performance at scale and researchers developing new click models.

This motivates our investigation into how properties of algorithm-distribution pairs can affect the choice for the number of folds in $k$-fold cross-validation. Our results consist of a novel decomposition of the mean-squared error of cross-validation for risk estimation, which explicitly captures the correlations of error estimates across overlapping folds and includes a novel algorithmic stability notion, squared loss stability, that is considerably weaker than the typically required hypothesis stability in other comparable works. Furthermore, we prove: 1. For every learning algorithm that minimizes empirical error, a minimax lower bound on the mean-squared error of $k$-fold CV estimating the population risk $L_\\mathcal{D}$: \\[ \\min_{k \\mid n}\\; \\max_{\\mathcal{D}}\\; \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\big(\\widehat{L}_{\\mathrm{CV}}^{(k)} - L_{\\mathcal{D}}\\big)^{2}\\right] \\;=\\; \\Omega\\!\\big(\\sqrt{k}/n\\big), \\] where $n$ is the sample size and $k$ the number of folds. This shows that even under idealized conditions, for large values of $k$, CV cannot attain the optimum of order $1/n$ achievable by a validation set of size $n$, reflecting an inherent penalty caused by dependence between folds. 2. Complementing this, we exhibit learning rules for which \\[ \\max_{\\mathcal{D}}\\; \\mathbb{E}\\!\\left[\\big(\\widehat{L}_{\\mathrm{CV}}^{(k)} - L_{\\mathcal{D}}\\big)^{2}\\right] \\;=\\; \\Omega(k/n), \\] matching (up to constants) the accuracy of a hold-out estimator of a single fold of size $n/k$. Together these results delineate the fundamental trade-off in resampling-based risk estimation: CV cannot fully exploit all $n$ samples for unbiased risk evaluation, and its minimax performance is pinned between the $k/n$ and $\\sqrt{k}/n$ regimes.",

The ASV under investigation features a recessed moon pool, which induces nonlinear responses due to sloshing, thereby increasing the modelling challenge. Data-driven reduced-order models were built from measurements of vessel motions and mooring loads. The HDMDc framework provided accurate deterministic predictions of vessel dynamics, while the Bayesian formulation enabled uncertainty-aware characterization of the model response by accounting for variability in hyperparameter selection. Validation against experimental data demonstrated that both HDMDc and BHDMDc can predict the vessel's response to unseen regular and irregular wave excitations. In conclusion, the study shows that HDMDc-based ROMs are a viable data-driven alternative for system identification, demonstrating for the first time their generalization capability for a sea condition different from the training set, achieving high accuracy in reproducing vessel dynamics.",

Methods such as CoOp and CoCoOp have shown that replacing handcrafted prompts with learnable vectors, known as prompt learning, can result in improved performance. However, these models often struggle to generalize to entirely unseen categories. While traditional zero-shot learning techniques benefit from various data augmentation strategies, prompt learning has primarily focused on text-based modifications, leaving the potential of image-based augmentation largely unexplored. In this work, we explore how image-level augmentations, particularly those that introduce attribute-specific variations, can support and enhance prompt learning. Our analysis examines the interaction between these augmentations and soft prompt frameworks, revealing their potential to improve generalization. We also identify a limitation in existing methods, such as CoCoOp, which do not provide explicit guidance for learning prompts that focus on semantically meaningful visual features. To address this, we propose Adding Attributes to Prompt Learning, AAPL, a novel method that introduces adversarial token embeddings to decouple superficial visual variations introduced by augmentation from class-relevant semantic representations. This decoupling enables the learned prompts to concentrate on visually discriminative features that align with the target categories. We conduct comprehensive experiments on eleven benchmark datasets, and AAPL consistently outperforms existing methods across few-shot, zero-shot, cross-dataset, and domain generalization settings.

All these models were evaluated on the performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Our findings have led us to conclude that the usage of data dimensionality reduction methods results in skewed performance metric values, which results in wrongly estimating the actual performance of quantum machine learning models. There are several factors, along with data dimensionality reduction methods, that worsen this problem, such as characteristics of the datasets, classical to quantum information embedding methods, percentage of feature reduction, classical components associated with quantum models, and structure of quantum machine learning models. We consistently observed the difference in the accuracy range of 14% to 48% amongst these models, using data reduction and not using it. Apart from this, our observations have shown that some data reduction methods tend to perform better for some specific data embedding methodologies and ansatz constructions.",

        "summary": "Open-weight models provide researchers and developers with accessible foundations for diverse downstream applications. We tested the safety and security postures of eight open-weight large language models (LLMs) to identify vulnerabilities that may impact subsequent fine-tuning and deployment. Using automated adversarial testing, we measured each model's resilience against single-turn and multi-turn prompt injection and jailbreak attacks. Our findings reveal pervasive vulnerabilities across all tested models, with multi-turn attacks achieving success rates between 25.86\\% and 92.78\\% -- representing a $2\\times$ to $10\\times$ increase over single-turn baselines. These results underscore a systemic inability of current open-weight models to maintain safety guardrails across extended interactions. We assess that alignment strategies and lab priorities significantly influence resilience: capability-focused models such as Llama 3.3 and Qwen 3 demonstrate higher multi-turn susceptibility, whereas safety-oriented designs such as Google Gemma 3 exhibit more balanced performance. The analysis concludes that open-weight models, while crucial for innovation, pose tangible operational and ethical risks when deployed without layered security controls. These findings are intended to inform practitioners and developers of the potential risks and the value of professional AI security solutions to mitigate exposure. Addressing multi-turn vulnerabilities is essential to ensure the safe, reliable, and responsible deployment of open-weight LLMs in enterprise and public domains. We recommend adopting a security-first design philosophy and layered protections to ensure resilient deployments of open-weight models.",

We investigated the drivers of endemic plant richness across Crete, a Mediterranean biodiversity hotspot, using spatially explicit data on species distributions, topographic complexity, climatic variability, land cover, and soil characteristics. Artificial Neural Network models, a machine learning tool, were employed to assess the relative importance of these predictors and to identify hotspots of endemism. We found that total species richness, elevation range, and climatic variability were the strongest predictors of endemic richness, reflecting the role of biodiversity, topographic heterogeneity, and climatic gradients in generating diverse habitats and micro-refugia that promote speciation and buffer extinction risk. Endemic hotspots only partially overlapped with areas of high total species richness, indicating that total species richness was the optimal from the ones examined, yet an imperfect surrogate. These environmentally heterogeneous areas also provide critical ecosystem services, including soil stabilization, pollination, and cultural value, which are increasingly threatened by tourism, renewable energy development, land-use change, and climate impacts. Our findings underscore the importance of prioritizing mountainous and climatically variable regions in conservation planning, integrating ecosystem service considerations, and accounting for within-island spatial heterogeneity. By explicitly linking the environmental drivers of endemism to both biodiversity patterns and ecosystem function, this study provides a framework for evidence-based conservation planning in Crete and other Mediterranean islands with similar geological and biogeographic contexts.",

The package includes implementations of robust kernel canonical correlation analysis (Kernel CCA), as well as the influence function (IF) for both standard and multiple kernel CCA frameworks. The influence function quantifies sensitivity and helps detect influential or outlying observations across two-view and multi-view datasets. Experiments using synthesized two-view and multi-view data demonstrate that the IF of the standard kernel CCA effectively identifies outliers, while the robust kernel methods implemented in RKUM exhibit reduced sensitivity to contamination.

However, while various prompting methods aim to describe visual content, many existing studies focus primarily on single-image settings or specific, constrained scenarios. This leaves a critical gap in understanding and addressing how MLLMs tackle more general and complex multi-image reasoning tasks. Thus, we first extensively investigate how current prompting methods perceive fine-grained visual details and process visual information when dealing with multiple images. Our findings reveal that existing prompting methods fall short in attending to needed clues and seamlessly integrating perception and reasoning. Inspired by the findings, we propose a new zero-shot prompting method, Question-Guided Chain-of-Captions (QG-CoC), a generalized prompting approach that effectively handles problems with an arbitrary number of images. We evaluate our method on various open-source and closed-source MLLMs for multi-image and single-image benchmarks. Experimental results indicate that QG-CoC demonstrates competitive performance across tasks and exhibits robust improvements in the challenging scenarios where existing prompting methods fail.",

This not only limits their creative potential but also raises concerns about privacy and safety. While empirical studies have explored mitigation strategies, theoretical understanding of memorization remains limited. We address this gap through developing a dual-separation result via two complementary perspectives: statistical estimation and network approximation. From the estimation side, we show that the ground-truth score function does not minimize the empirical denoising loss, creating a separation that drives memorization. From the approximation side, we prove that implementing the empirical score function requires network size to scale with sample size, spelling a separation compared to the more compact network representation of the ground-truth score function. Guided by these insights, we develop a pruning-based method that reduces memorization while maintaining generation quality in diffusion transformers.",

The rectified flow can be regarded as an approximation to optimal transport, but in contrast to other transport methods that require optimization over a function space, computing the rectified flow only requires standard statistical tools such as regression or density estimation. Because of this, one can leverage standard data analysis tools for regression and density estimation to develop empirical versions of transport maps. We study some structural properties of the rectified flow, including existence, uniqueness, and regularity, as well as the related statistical properties, such as rates of convergence and central limit theorems, for some selected estimators. To do so, we analyze separately the bounded and unbounded cases as each presents unique challenges. In both cases, we are able to establish convergence at faster rates than the ones for the usual nonparametric regression and density estimation.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development. However, while LLMs remain static after pretraining, programming languages and APIs continue to evolve, leading to the generation of deprecated or incompatible code that undermines reliability. Retraining LLMs from scratch to reflect such changes is computationally expensive, making model editing a promising lightweight alternative that updates only a small subset of parameters. Despite its potential, it remains unclear whether model editing yields genuine syntactic and semantic adaptations or merely superficial fixes. In this work, we present a systematic study of five state-of-the-art model editing methods: Constrained Fine-Tuning (FT), GRACE, MEMIT, PMET, and ROME. We apply these methods to three leading open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeQwen1.5, and DeepSeek-Coder, under controlled API deprecation scenarios. Our evaluation covers both instant and sequential editing settings, using three disjoint evaluation sets designed to assess reliability, generalization, and specificity. We measure model correctness at three levels: successful compilation, partial test case pass, and full test pass. Our findings show that instant edits consistently degrade model performance, with syntactic validity dropping by up to 86 percentage points and functional correctness declining by 45 points even in the best-performing setting. Sequential edits further amplify this degradation, and in some cases, model performance collapses entirely. Across all models, most passing generations relied on workarounds rather than correctly adopting the intended changes, while faulty adoptions that result in test failures or compilation errors were significantly more frequent. Correct adoptions, where the model correctly integrates the intended change, occurred in only about 6% of cases.",

        "summary": "Human-robot cooperation is essential in environments such as warehouses and retail stores, where workers frequently handle deformable objects like paper, bags, and fabrics. Coordinating robotic actions with human assistance remains difficult due to the unpredictable dynamics of deformable materials and the need for adaptive force control. To explore this challenge, we focus on the task of gift wrapping, which exemplifies a long-horizon manipulation problem involving precise folding, controlled creasing, and secure fixation of paper. Success is achieved when the robot completes the sequence to produce a neatly wrapped package with clean folds and no tears. We propose a learning-based framework that integrates a high-level task planner powered by a large language model (LLM) with a low-level hybrid imitation learning (IL) and reinforcement learning (RL) policy. At its core is a Sub-task Aware Robotic Transformer (START) that learns a unified policy from human demonstrations. The key novelty lies in capturing long-range temporal dependencies across the full wrapping sequence within a single model. Unlike vanilla Action Chunking with Transformer (ACT), typically applied to short tasks, our method introduces sub-task IDs that provide explicit temporal grounding. This enables robust performance across the entire wrapping process and supports flexible execution, as the policy learns sub-goals rather than merely replicating motion sequences. Our framework achieves a 97% success rate on real-world wrapping tasks. We show that the unified transformer-based policy reduces the need for specialized models, allows controlled human supervision, and effectively bridges high-level intent with the fine-grained force control required for deformable object manipulation.",

Traditional Earth-Moon transfers suffer from rigid launch windows and high propellant demands, while Earth-based GNSS systems provide little to no coverage beyond geostationary orbit. This limits autonomy and environmental awareness in cislunar space. This review compares four major transfer strategies by evaluating velocity requirements, flight durations, and fuel efficiency, and by identifying their suitability for both crewed and robotic missions. The emerging role of artificial intelligence and machine learning is highlighted: convolutional neural networks support automated crater recognition and digital terrain model generation, while deep reinforcement learning enables adaptive trajectory refinement during descent and landing to reduce risk and decision latency. The study also examines how GNSS-Reflectometry and advanced Positioning, Navigation, and Timing architectures can extend navigation capabilities beyond current limits. GNSS-R can act as a bistatic radar for mapping lunar ice, soil properties, and surface topography, while PNT systems support autonomous rendezvous, Lagrange point station-keeping, and coordinated satellite swarm operations. Combining these developments establishes a scalable framework for sustainable cislunar exploration and long-term human and robotic presence.",

To address these issues, we modified the exponential function to obtain a novel headway distribution. Rather than employing Euler's number (e) as the base of the exponential function, we utilized a real number base to provide greater flexibility in modeling the observed headway. However, the proposed is not a probability function. We normalize it to calculate the probability and derive the closed-form equation. In this study, we utilized a comprehensive experiment with five open datasets: highD, exiD, NGSIM, Waymo, and Lyft to evaluate the performance of the proposed distribution and compared its performance with six existing distributions under mixed and heterogeneous traffic flow. The results revealed that the proposed distribution not only captures the fundamental characteristics of headway distribution but also provides physically meaningful parameters that describe the distribution shape of observed headways. Under heterogeneous flow on highways (i.e., uninterrupted traffic flow), the proposed distribution outperforms other candidate distributions. Under urban road conditions (i.e., interrupted traffic flow), including heterogeneous and mixed traffic, the proposed distribution still achieves decent results.",

FlatCAD introduced the Off-Diagonal Weingarten (ODW) loss as an efficient second-order prior for CAD surfaces, approximating full-Hessian regularization at roughly half the computational cost. However, FlatCAD applies a fixed ODW weight throughout training, which is suboptimal: strong regularization stabilizes early optimization but suppresses detail recovery in later stages. We present scheduling strategies for the ODW loss that assign a high initial weight to stabilize optimization and progressively decay it to permit fine-scale refinement. We investigate constant, linear, quintic, and step interpolation schedules, as well as an increasing warm-up variant. Experiments on the ABC CAD dataset demonstrate that time-varying schedules consistently outperform fixed weights. Our method achieves up to a 35% improvement in Chamfer Distance over the FlatCAD baseline, establishing scheduling as a simple yet effective extension of curvature regularization for robust CAD reconstruction.",

In this paper, we propose the DeltaBO algorithm, in which a novel uncertainty-quantification approach is built on the difference function $\\delta$ between the source and target functions, which are allowed to belong to different reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs). Under mild assumptions, we prove that the regret of DeltaBO is of order $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(\\sqrt{T (T/N + \\gamma_\\delta)})$, where $N$ denotes the number of evaluations from source tasks and typically $N \\gg T$.

While recent advances in generative models offer a promising way for inverse design, most approaches require large datasets and must be retrained for every new target property. Here, we introduce the EGMOF (Efficient Generation of MOFs), a hybrid diffusion-transformer framework that overcomes these limitations through a modular, descriptor-mediated workflow. EGMOF decomposes inverse design into two steps: (1) a one-dimensional diffusion model (Prop2Desc) that maps desired properties to chemically meaningful descriptors followed by (2) a transformer model (Desc2MOF) that generates structures from these descriptors. This modular hybrid design enables minimal retraining and maintains high accuracy even under small-data conditions. On a hydrogen uptake dataset, EGMOF achieved over 95% validity and 84% hit rate, representing significant improvements of up to 57% in validity and 14% in hit rate compared to existing methods, while remaining effective with only 1,000 training samples. Moreover, our model successfully performed conditional generation across 29 diverse property datasets, including CoREMOF, QMOF, and text-mined experimental datasets, whereas previous models have not. This work presents a data-efficient, generalizable approach to the inverse design of diverse MOFs and highlights the potential of modular inverse design workflows for broader materials discovery.",

        "summary": "Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning have improved diagnostic capabilities in healthcare, yet limited interpretability continues to hinder clinical adoption. Schizophrenia, a complex disorder with diverse symptoms including disorganized speech and social withdrawal, demands tools that capture symptom severity and provide clinically meaningful insights beyond binary diagnosis. Here, we present an interpretable framework that leverages articulatory speech features through eigenspectra difference plots and a weighted sum with exponential decay (WSED) to quantify vocal tract coordination. Eigenspectra plots effectively distinguished complex from simpler coordination patterns, and WSED scores reliably separated these groups, with ambiguity confined to a narrow range near zero. Importantly, WSED scores correlated not only with overall BPRS severity but also with the balance between positive and negative symptoms, reflecting more complex coordination in subjects with pronounced positive symptoms and the opposite trend for stronger negative symptoms. This approach offers a transparent, severity-sensitive biomarker for schizophrenia, advancing the potential for clinically interpretable speech-based assessment tools.",

        "summary": "Artificial intelligence (AI) systems hold great promise for advancing various scientific disciplines, and are increasingly used in real-world applications. Despite their remarkable progress, further capabilities are expected in order to achieve more general types of intelligence. A critical distinction in this context is between factual knowledge, which can be evaluated against true or false answers (e.g., \"what is the capital of England?\"), and probabilistic knowledge, reflecting probabilistic properties of the real world (e.g., \"what is the sex of a computer science graduate in the US?\"). In this paper, our goal is to build a benchmark for understanding the capabilities of LLMs in terms of knowledge of probability distributions describing the real world. Given that LLMs are trained on vast amounts of text, it may be plausible that they internalize aspects of these distributions. Indeed, LLMs are touted as powerful universal approximators of real-world distributions. At the same time, classical results in statistics, known as curse of dimensionality, highlight fundamental challenges in learning distributions in high dimensions, challenging the notion of universal distributional learning. In this work, we develop the first benchmark to directly test this hypothesis, evaluating whether LLMs have access to empirical distributions describing real-world populations across domains such as economics, health, education, and social behavior. Our results demonstrate that LLMs perform poorly overall, and do not seem to internalize real-world statistics naturally. When interpreted in the context of Pearl's Causal Hierarchy (PCH), our benchmark demonstrates that language models do not contain knowledge on observational distributions (Layer 1 of PCH), and thus the Causal Hierarchy Theorem implies that interventional (Layer 2) and counterfactual (Layer 3) knowledge of these models is also limited.",

However, obtaining the ground truth (GT) for evaluation is often costly and infeasible in many real-world applications. To reduce this long-standing reliance on GT in uncertainty evaluation research, this study presents a learning-based framework for MLS point clouds that integrates optimal neighborhood estimation with geometric feature extraction. Experiments on a real-world dataset show that the proposed framework is feasible and the XGBoost model delivers fully comparable accuracy to Random Forest while achieving substantially higher efficiency (about 3 times faster), providing initial evidence that geometric features can be used to predict point-level uncertainty quantified by the C2C distance. In summary, this study shows that MLS point clouds' uncertainty is learnable, offering a novel learning-based viewpoint towards uncertainty evaluation research.",

We show that the answer is yes in the textbook setting of unconstrained quadratic objectives: the optimal convergence rate for first-order algorithms is strictly better for min-max problems than for the corresponding variational inequalities. The key reason that min-max algorithms can be faster is that they can exploit the asymmetry of the min and max variables--a property that is lost in the reduction to variational inequalities. Central to our analyses are sharp characterizations of optimal convergence rates in terms of extremal polynomials which we compute using Green's functions and conformal mappings.",

Yet little is known theoretically about the impact of Sobolev training -- regression with both function and gradient data -- on the generalization error of highly overparameterized predictive models in high dimensions. In this paper, we obtain a precise characterization of this training modality for random feature (RF) models in the limit where the number of trainable parameters, input dimensions, and training data tend proportionally to infinity. Our model for Sobolev training reflects practical implementations by sketching gradient data onto finite dimensional subspaces. By combining the replica method from statistical physics with linearizations in operator-valued free probability theory, we derive a closed-form description for the generalization errors of the trained RF models. For target functions described by single-index models, we demonstrate that supplementing function data with additional gradient data does not universally improve predictive performance. Rather, the degree of overparameterization should inform the choice of training method. More broadly, our results identify settings where models perform optimally by interpolating noisy function and gradient data.",

This research presents a hybrid analytical framework that integrates statistical modelling and machine learning for detecting and forecasting cyberattack patterns in the e-commerce domain. Using the Verizon Community Data Breach (VCDB) dataset, the study applies Auto ARIMA for temporal forecasting and significance testing, including a Mann-Whitney U test (U = 2579981.5, p = 0.0121), which confirmed that holiday shopping events experienced significantly more severe cyberattacks than non-holiday periods. ANOVA was also used to examine seasonal variation in threat severity, while ensemble machine learning models (XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost) were employed for predictive classification. Results reveal recurrent attack spikes during high-risk periods such as Black Friday and holiday seasons, with breaches involving Personally Identifiable Information (PII) exhibiting elevated threat indicators. Among the models, CatBoost achieved the highest performance (accuracy = 85.29%, F1 score = 0.2254, ROC AUC = 0.8247). The framework uniquely combines seasonal forecasting with interpretable ensemble learning, enabling temporal risk anticipation and breach-type classification.

        "summary": "Comparing clusterings is central to evaluating unsupervised models, yet the many existing similarity measures can produce widely divergent, sometimes contradictory, evaluations. Clustering similarity measures are typically organized into two principal families, pair-counting and information-theoretic, reflecting whether they quantify agreement through element pairs or aggregate information across full cluster contingency tables. Prior work has uncovered parallels between these families and applied empirical normalization or chance-correction schemes, but their deeper analytical connection remains only partially understood. Here, we develop an analytical framework that unifies these families through two complementary perspectives. First, both families are expressed as weighted expansions of observed versus expected co-occurrences, with pair-counting arising as a quadratic, low-order approximation and information-theoretic measures as higher-order, frequency-weighted extensions. Second, we generalize pair-counting to $k$-tuple agreement and show that information-theoretic measures can be viewed as systematically accumulating higher-order co-assignment structure beyond the pairwise level. We illustrate the approaches analytically for the Rand index and Mutual Information, and show how other indices in each family emerge as natural extensions. Together, these views clarify when and why the two regimes diverge, relating their sensitivities directly to weighting and approximation order, and provide a principled basis for selecting, interpreting, and extending clustering similarity measures across applications.",

We introduce a scalable latent diffusion model for single-cell gene expression data, which we refer to as scLDM, that respects the fundamental exchangeability property of the data. Our VAE uses fixed-size latent variables leveraging a unified Multi-head Cross-Attention Block (MCAB) architecture, which serves dual roles: permutation-invariant pooling in the encoder and permutation-equivariant unpooling in the decoder. We enhance this framework by replacing the Gaussian prior with a latent diffusion model using Diffusion Transformers and linear interpolants, enabling high-quality generation with multi-conditional classifier-free guidance. We show its superior performance in a variety of experiments for both observational and perturbational single-cell data, as well as downstream tasks like cell-level classification.",

EvtSlowTV is an order of magnitude larger than existing event datasets, providing an unconstrained, naturalistic setting for event-based depth learning. This work shows the suitability of EvtSlowTV for a self-supervised learning framework to capitalise on the HDR potential of raw event streams.

We introduce a novel reservoir computing (RC) framework that integrates time-delay embedding with Random Fourier Feature (RFF) mappings to construct a dynamical reservoir without the need for traditional recurrent architectures. Unlike standard RC, which relies on high-dimensional recurrent connectivity, the proposed RFF-RC explicitly approximates nonlinear kernel transformations that uncover latent dynamical relations in the reconstructed phase space. This hybrid formulation offers two key advantages: (i) it provides a principled way to approximate complex nonlinear interactions among delayed coordinates, thereby enriching the effective dynamical representation of the reservoir, and (ii) it reduces reliance on manual reservoir hyperparameters such as spectral radius and leaking rate. We evaluate the framework on canonical chaotic systems-the Mackey-Glass equation, the Lorenz system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation. This novel formulation demonstrates that RFF-RC not only achieves superior prediction accuracy but also yields robust attractor reconstructions and long-horizon forecasts. These results show that the combination of delay embedding and RFF-based reservoirs reveals new dynamical structure by embedding the system in an enriched feature space, providing a computationally efficient and interpretable approach to modeling chaotic dynamics.",

Initially, each model is trained to extract a single feature, ensuring precise and interpretable outputs. A series of experiments is then carried out to evaluate the proposed method across multiple setups, including global versus lead-specific features, different sampling frequencies, and comparisons with other approaches such as ECGdeli. Our findings show that ECGXtract achieves robust performance across most features with a mean correlation score of 0.80 with the ground truth for global features, with lead II consistently providing the best results. For lead-specific features, ECGXtract achieves a mean correlation score of 0.822. Moreover, ECGXtract achieves superior results to the state-of-the-art open source ECGdeli as it got a higher correlation score with the ground truth in 90% of the features. Furthermore, we explore the feasibility of extracting multiple features simultaneously utilizing a single model. Semantic grouping is proved to be effective for global features, while large-scale grouping and lead-specific multi-output models show notable performance drops.

Conventional artifact removal methods require manual intervention or risk suppressing critical neural features during filtering/reconstruction. Recent advances in generative models, including Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have shown promise for EEG reconstruction; however, these approaches often lack integrated temporal-spectral-spatial sensitivity and are computationally intensive, limiting their suitability for real-time applications like brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). To overcome these challenges, we introduce EEGReXferNet, a lightweight Gen-AI framework for EEG subspace reconstruction via cross-subject transfer learning - developed using Keras TensorFlow (v2.15.1). EEGReXferNet employs a modular architecture that leverages volume conduction across neighboring channels, band-specific convolution encoding, and dynamic latent feature extraction through sliding windows. By integrating reference-based scaling, the framework ensures continuity across successive windows and generalizes effectively across subjects. This design improves spatial-temporal-spectral resolution (mean PSD correlation >= 0.95; mean spectrogram RV-Coefficient >= 0.85), reduces total weights by ~45% to mitigate overfitting, and maintains computational efficiency for robust, real-time EEG preprocessing in neurophysiological and BCI applications.",

        "summary": "The human neocortex is functionally organised at its highest level along a continuous sensory-to-association (AS) hierarchy. This study characterises the AS hierarchy of patients with schizophrenia in a comparison with controls. Using a large fMRI dataset (N=355), we extracted individual AS gradients via spectral analysis of brain connectivity, quantified hierarchical specialisation by gradient spread, and related this spread with connectivity geometry. We found that schizophrenia compresses the AS hierarchy indicating reduced functional differentiation. By modelling neural timescale with the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, we observed that the most specialised, locally cohesive regions at the gradient extremes exhibit dynamics with a longer time constant, an effect that is attenuated in schizophrenia. To study computation, we used the gradients to regularise subject-specific recurrent neural networks (RNNs) trained on working memory tasks. Networks endowed with greater gradient spread learned more efficiently, plateaued at lower task loss, and maintained stronger alignment to the prescribed AS hierarchical geometry. Fixed point linearisation showed that high-range networks settled into more stable neural states during memory delay, evidenced by lower energy and smaller maximal Jacobian eigenvalues. This gradient-regularised RNN framework therefore links large-scale cortical architecture with fixed point stability, providing a mechanistic account of how gradient de-differentiation could destabilise neural computations in schizophrenia, convergently supported by empirical timescale flattening and model-based evidence of less stable fixed points.",

        "summary": "We prove that every randomized Boolean function admits a supersimulator: a randomized polynomial-size circuit whose output on random inputs cannot be efficiently distinguished from reality with constant advantage, even by polynomially larger distinguishers. Our result builds on the landmark complexity-theoretic regularity lemma of Trevisan, Tulsiani and Vadhan (2009), which, in contrast, provides a simulator that fools smaller distinguishers. We circumvent lower bounds for the simulator size by letting the distinguisher size bound vary with the target function, while remaining below an absolute upper bound independent of the target function. This dependence on the target function arises naturally from our use of an iteration technique originating in the graph regularity literature. The simulators provided by the regularity lemma and recent refinements thereof, known as multiaccurate and multicalibrated predictors, respectively, as per Hebert-Johnson et al. (2018), have previously been shown to have myriad applications in complexity theory, cryptography, learning theory, and beyond. We first show that a recent multicalibration-based characterization of the computational indistinguishability of product distributions actually requires only (calibrated) multiaccuracy. We then show that supersimulators yield an even tighter result in this application domain, closing a complexity gap present in prior versions of the characterization.",

In this work, we present an auditing framework, AAA, which operationalizes WCAG-EM through a human-AI partnership model. AAA is anchored by two key innovations: GRASP, a graph-based multimodal sampling method that ensures representative page coverage via learned embeddings of visual, textual, and relational cues; and MaC, a multimodal large language model-based copilot that supports auditors through cross-modal reasoning and intelligent assistance in high-effort tasks. Together, these components enable scalable, end-to-end web accessibility auditing, empowering human auditors with AI-enhanced assistance for real-world impact. We further contribute four novel datasets designed for benchmarking core stages of the audit pipeline.

        "summary": "Psychological constructs within individuals are widely believed to be interconnected. We investigated whether and how Large Language Models (LLMs) can model the correlational structure of human psychological traits from minimal quantitative inputs. We prompted various LLMs with Big Five Personality Scale responses from 816 human individuals to role-play their responses on nine other psychological scales. LLMs demonstrated remarkable accuracy in capturing human psychological structure, with the inter-scale correlation patterns from LLM-generated responses strongly aligning with those from human data $(R^2 > 0.89)$. This zero-shot performance substantially exceeded predictions based on semantic similarity and approached the accuracy of machine learning algorithms trained directly on the dataset. Analysis of reasoning traces revealed that LLMs use a systematic two-stage process: First, they transform raw Big Five responses into natural language personality summaries through information selection and compression, analogous to generating sufficient statistics. Second, they generate target scale responses based on reasoning from these summaries. For information selection, LLMs identify the same key personality factors as trained algorithms, though they fail to differentiate item importance within factors. The resulting compressed summaries are not merely redundant representations but capture synergistic information--adding them to original scores enhances prediction alignment, suggesting they encode emergent, second-order patterns of trait interplay. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can precisely predict individual participants' psychological traits from minimal data through a process of abstraction and reasoning, offering both a powerful tool for psychological simulation and valuable insights into their emergent reasoning capabilities.",

This paper proposes a novel safety response framework designed to systematically safeguard LLMs at both the input and output levels. At the input level, the framework employs a supervised fine-tuning-based safety classification model. Through a fine-grained four-tier taxonomy (Safe, Unsafe, Conditionally Safe, Focused Attention), it performs precise risk identification and differentiated handling of user queries, significantly enhancing risk coverage and business scenario adaptability, and achieving a risk recall rate of 99.3%. At the output level, the framework integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with a specifically fine-tuned interpretation model, ensuring all responses are grounded in a real-time, trustworthy knowledge base. This approach eliminates information fabrication and enables result traceability. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed safety control model achieves a significantly higher safety score on public safety evaluation benchmarks compared to the baseline model, TinyR1-Safety-8B. Furthermore, on our proprietary high-risk test set, the framework's components attained a perfect 100% safety score, validating their exceptional protective capabilities in complex risk scenarios.

        "summary": "As optimization problems grow increasingly complex and diverse, advancements in optimization techniques and paradigm innovations hold significant importance. The challenges posed by optimization problems are primarily manifested in their non-convexity, high-dimensionality, black-box nature, and other unfavorable characteristics. Traditional zero-order or first-order methods, which are often characterized by low efficiency, inaccurate gradient information, and insufficient utilization of optimization information, are ill-equipped to address these challenges effectively. In recent years, the rapid development of large language models (LLM) has led to substantial improvements in their language understanding and code generation capabilities. Consequently, the design of optimization algorithms leveraging large language models has garnered increasing attention from researchers. In this study, we choose the fireworks algorithm(FWA) as the basic optimizer and propose a novel approach to assist the design of the FWA by incorporating multi-modal large language model(MLLM). To put it simply, we propose the concept of Critical Part(CP), which extends FWA to complex high-dimensional tasks, and further utilizes the information in the optimization process with the help of the multi-modal characteristics of large language models. We focus on two specific tasks: the \\textit{traveling salesman problem }(TSP) and \\textit{electronic design automation problem} (EDA). The experimental results show that FWAs generated under our new framework have achieved or surpassed SOTA results on many problem instances.",

In such setting, the model has to read and comprehend the problems in natural language, formalize them in Lean language, then proceed with proving the problems, and it will get credit for each problem if the formal proof corresponds to the original informal statement presented to the model. Our evaluation results reveal that the best accuracy of such pipeline can be about 36% using the SoTA models in the literature, considerably lower than the individual SoTA accuracies, 97% and 69% reported in the autoformalization and theorem proving literature. Analyzing the failure modes, we trace back a considerable portion of this drop to discrepancies between the formal and informal statements for more than half of the problems in miniF2F. We proceed with correcting all the errors, discrepancies and simplifications in formal and informal statements, and present the miniF2F-v2 with fully verified formal and informal statements and proofs. Evaluating the full theorem proving pipeline on miniF2F-v2 leads to the best accuracy of 70%, a significant improvement from the 40% on the original miniF2F, yet indicating considerable misalignment between the autoformalization models and theorem provers. Our deep analysis suggests that a higher quality benchmark can help the community better evaluate progress in the field of formal reasoning and also better diagnose the failure and success modes of autoformalization and theorem proving models.

        "summary": "The rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in healthcare has been accompanied by scrutiny of their oversight. Existing monitoring approaches, inherited from traditional machine learning (ML), are task-based and founded on assumed performance degradation arising from dataset drift. In contrast, with LLMs, inevitable model degradation due to changes in populations compared to the training dataset cannot be assumed, because LLMs were not trained for any specific task in any given population. We therefore propose a new organizing principle guiding generalist LLM monitoring that is scalable and grounded in how these models are developed and used in practice: capability-based monitoring. Capability-based monitoring is motivated by the fact that LLMs are generalist systems whose overlapping internal capabilities are reused across numerous downstream tasks. Instead of evaluating each downstream task independently, this approach organizes monitoring around shared model capabilities, such as summarization, reasoning, translation, or safety guardrails, in order to enable cross-task detection of systemic weaknesses, long-tail errors, and emergent behaviors that task-based monitoring may miss. We describe considerations for developers, organizational leaders, and professional societies for implementing a capability-based monitoring approach. Ultimately, capability-based monitoring will provide a scalable foundation for safe, adaptive, and collaborative monitoring of LLMs and future generalist artificial intelligence models in healthcare.",

        "summary": "The proliferation of 100B+ parameter Large Language Models (LLMs) with 100k+ context length support have resulted in increasing demands for on-chip memory to support large KV caches. Techniques such as StreamingLLM and SnapKV demonstrate how to control KV cache size while maintaining model accuracy. Yet, these techniques are not commonly used within industrial deployments using frameworks like vLLM or SGLang. The reason is twofold: on one hand, the static graphs and continuous batching methodology employed by these frameworks make it difficult to admit modifications to the standard multi-head attention algorithm, while on the other hand, the accuracy implications of such techniques on modern instruction-following and reasoning models are not well understood, obfuscating the need for implementing these techniques. In this paper, we explore these accuracy implications on Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1, and develop SnapStream, a KV cache compression method that can be deployed at scale. We demonstrate the efficacy of SnapStream in a 16-way tensor-parallel deployment of DeepSeek-671B on SambaNova SN40L accelerators running at 128k context length and up to 1832 tokens per second in a real production setting. SnapStream enables $4\\times$ improved on-chip memory usage and introduces minimal accuracy degradation on LongBench-v2, AIME24 and LiveCodeBench.

Large language models show promise for individual tasks, but end-to-end analytical workflows expose fundamental limitations: attention dilutes across growing contexts, specialized reasoning patterns interfere, and errors propagate undetected. We present PublicAgent, a multi-agent framework that addresses these limitations through decomposition into specialized agents for intent clarification, dataset discovery, analysis, and reporting. This architecture maintains focused attention within agent contexts and enables validation at each stage. Evaluation across five models and 50 queries derives five design principles for multi-agent LLM systems. First, specialization provides value independent of model strength--even the strongest model shows 97.5% agent win rates, with benefits orthogonal to model scale. Second, agents divide into universal (discovery, analysis) and conditional (report, intent) categories. Universal agents show consistent effectiveness (std dev 12.4%) while conditional agents vary by model (std dev 20.5%). Third, agents mitigate distinct failure modes--removing discovery or analysis causes catastrophic failures (243-280 instances), while removing report or intent causes quality degradation. Fourth, architectural benefits persist across task complexity with stable win rates (86-92% analysis, 84-94% discovery), indicating workflow management value rather than reasoning enhancement. Fifth, wide variance in agent effectiveness across models (42-96% for analysis) requires model-aware architecture design. These principles guide when and why specialization is necessary for complex analytical workflows while enabling broader access to public data through natural language interfaces.",

AI control offers one approach to mitigating the risk from untrusted AI agents by monitoring their actions and intervening or auditing when necessary.

In this work, we systematically evaluate a range of control protocols in SHADE-Arena, a dataset of diverse agentic environments. First, we evaluate blue team protocols, including deferral to trusted models, resampling, and deferring on critical actions, against a default attack policy. We find that resampling for incrimination and deferring on critical actions perform best, increasing safety from 50% to 96%. We then iterate on red team strategies against these protocols and find that attack policies with additional affordances, such as knowledge of when resampling occurs or the ability to simulate monitors, can substantially improve attack success rates against our resampling strategy, decreasing safety to 17%. However, deferring on critical actions is highly robust to even our strongest red team strategies, demonstrating the importance of denying attack policies access to protocol internals.",

In this paper, we present the OpenHands Software Agent SDK, a toolkit for implementing software development agents that satisfy these desiderata. This toolkit is a complete architectural redesign of the agent components of the popular OpenHands framework for software development agents, which has 64k+ GitHub stars. To achieve flexibility, we design a simple interface for implementing agents that requires only a few lines of code in the default case, but is easily extensible to more complex, full-featured agents with features such as custom tools, memory management, and more. For security and reliability, it delivers seamless local-to-remote execution portability, integrated REST/WebSocket services. For interaction with human users, it can connect directly to a variety of interfaces, such as visual workspaces (VS Code, VNC, browser), command-line interfaces, and APIs. Compared with existing SDKs from OpenAI, Claude, and Google, OpenHands uniquely integrates native sandboxed execution, lifecycle control, model-agnostic multi-LLM routing, and built-in security analysis. Empirical results on SWE-Bench Verified and GAIA benchmarks demonstrate strong performance. Put together, these elements allow the OpenHands Software Agent SDK to provide a practical foundation for prototyping, unlocking new classes of custom applications, and reliably deploying agents at scale.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in sensitive domains including healthcare, legal services, and confidential communications, where privacy is paramount. This paper introduces Whisper Leak, a side-channel attack that infers user prompt topics from encrypted LLM traffic by analyzing packet size and timing patterns in streaming responses. Despite TLS encryption protecting content, these metadata patterns leak sufficient information to enable topic classification. We demonstrate the attack across 28 popular LLMs from major providers, achieving near-perfect classification (often >98% AUPRC) and high precision even at extreme class imbalance (10,000:1 noise-to-target ratio). For many models, we achieve 100% precision in identifying sensitive topics like \"money laundering\" while recovering 5-20% of target conversations. This industry-wide vulnerability poses significant risks for users under network surveillance by ISPs, governments, or local adversaries. We evaluate three mitigation strategies - random padding, token batching, and packet injection - finding that while each reduces attack effectiveness, none provides complete protection. Through responsible disclosure, we have collaborated with providers to implement initial countermeasures. Our findings underscore the need for LLM providers to address metadata leakage as AI systems handle increasingly sensitive information.",

We used a ``hide and seek'' task to evaluate this behavior under conditions where pursuit (seeking) could be toggled to avoidance (hiding), while leaving the probability distribution fixed, or varying complexity by changing the number of possible choices. We developed a model for participant choice built from choice frequency histograms treated as vectors. We posited the existence of a probability antimatching strategy for avoidance (hiding) rounds, and formalized this as a vector reflection of probability matching. We found that only two basis policies: matching/antimatching and maximizing/minimizing were sufficient to account for participant choices across a range of room numbers and opponent probability distributions. This schema requires only that people have the ability to remember the relative frequency of the different outcomes. With this knowledge simple operations can construct the maximizing and minimizing policies as well as matching and antimatching strategies. A mixture of these two policies captures human choice patterns in a stochastic environment.",

Manual optimization is resource-intensive, while existing automatic approaches often rely on complex hardware-specific heuristics and uninterpretable intermediate representations, hindering performance portability. We introduce PerfLLM, a novel automatic optimization methodology leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). Central to this is PerfDojo, an environment framing optimization as an RL game using a human-readable, mathematically-inspired code representation that guarantees semantic validity through transformations. This allows effective optimization without prior hardware knowledge, facilitating both human analysis and RL agent training.

To address this, we propose the Multi-User Preferences Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (MUP-QBAF), a novel multi-user personalisation framework based on Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Frameworks (QBAFs) that explicitly models and resolves multi-user preference conflicts. Unlike prior work in Argumentation Frameworks, which typically assumes static inputs, our approach is tailored to robotics: it incorporates both users' arguments and the robot's dynamic observations of the environment, allowing the system to adapt over time and respond to changing contexts. Preferences, both positive and negative, are represented as arguments whose strength is recalculated iteratively based on new information. The framework's properties and capabilities are presented and validated through a realistic case study, where an assistive robot mediates between the conflicting preferences of a caregiver and a care recipient during a frailty assessment task. This evaluation further includes a sensitivity analysis of argument base scores, demonstrating how preference outcomes can be shaped by user input and contextual observations. By offering a transparent, structured, and context-sensitive approach to resolving competing user preferences, this work advances the field of multi-user HRI. It provides a principled alternative to data-driven methods, enabling robots to navigate conflicts in real-world environments.",

Our system consists of three components: one that extracts and structures relevant GitHub context, another that uses this context to generate high-level explanations of the code's purpose, and a third that validates the explanation. We implemented this as a standalone tool, as well as a server within the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling integration with other AI-assisted development tools. Our main use case is that of enhancing a standard LLM-based code explanation with code insights that our system generates. To evaluate explanations' quality, we conducted a small scale user study, with developers of several open projects, as well as developers of proprietary projects.

Climate-based feature representations characterize each port's marine conditions, while mobility networks derived from Automatic Identification System data capture vessel flows and potential transfer pathways. Clustering and metric learning reveal climate analogues and enable the estimation of species survival likelihood along shipping routes. A temporal link prediction model captures how traffic patterns may change under shifting environmental conditions. The resulting fusion of environmental similarity and predicted mobility provides exposure estimates at the port and voyage levels, supporting targeted monitoring, routing adjustments, and management interventions.",

However, the literature at the intersection of these verticals, i.e., Agentic Embodied AI, remains scarce. This paper introduces an MCP server for analyzing ROS and ROS 2 bags, allowing for analyzing, visualizing and processing robot data with natural language through LLMs and VLMs. We describe specific tooling built with robotics domain knowledge, with our initial release focused on mobile robotics and supporting natively the analysis of trajectories, laser scan data, transforms, or time series data. This is in addition to providing an interface to standard ROS 2 CLI tools (\"ros2 bag list\" or \"ros2 bag info\"), as well as the ability to filter bags with a subset of topics or trimmed in time. Coupled with the MCP server, we provide a lightweight UI that allows the benchmarking of the tooling with different LLMs, both proprietary (Anthropic, OpenAI) and open-source (through Groq). Our experimental results include the analysis of tool calling capabilities of eight different state-of-the-art LLM/VLM models, both proprietary and open-source, large and small. Our experiments indicate that there is a large divide in tool calling capabilities, with Kimi K2 and Claude Sonnet 4 demonstrating clearly superior performance. We also conclude that there are multiple factors affecting the success rates, from the tool description schema to the number of arguments, as well as the number of tools available to the models.

Developing a dexterous robotic hand requires balancing human-like agility with engineering constraints such as complexity, size-to-weight ratio, durability, and force-sensing performance. This letter presents Dex-Hand 021, a high-performance, cable-driven five-finger robotic hand with 12 active and 7 passive degrees of freedom (DoFs), achieving 19 DoFs dexterity in a lightweight 1 kg design. We propose a proprioceptive force-sensing-based admittance control method to enhance manipulation. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance: a single-finger load capacity exceeding 10 N, fingertip repeatability under 0.001 m, and force estimation errors below 0.2 N. Compared to PID control, joint torques in multi-object grasping are reduced by 31.19%, significantly improves force-sensing capability while preventing overload during collisions. The hand excels in both power and precision grasps, successfully executing 33 GRASP taxonomy motions and complex manipulation tasks.

Despite the prevalent applications of Large Language Models (LLMs) for requirement analytics, LQPR takes a different perspective to address the classification: we observed that performance requirements can exhibit strong patterns and are often short/concise, therefore we design a lightweight linguistically induced matching mechanism. We compare LQPR against nine state-of-the-art learning-based approaches over diverse datasets, demonstrating that it is ranked as the sole best for 75% or more cases with two orders less cost. Our work proves that, at least for performance requirement quantification, specialized methods can be more suitable than the general LLM-driven approaches.",

Due to privacy constraints and limited access to user interaction data, recent efforts have shifted toward content-based recommendation, which relies solely on textual information. However, existing models typically treat papers as unstructured text, neglecting their discourse organization and thereby limiting semantic completeness and interpretability. To address these limitations, we propose OMRC-MR, a hierarchical framework that integrates QA-style OMRC (Objective, Method, Result, Conclusion) summarization, multi-level contrastive learning, and structure-aware re-ranking for scholarly recommendation. The QA-style summarization module converts raw papers into structured and discourse-consistent representations, while multi-level contrastive objectives align semantic representations across metadata, section, and document levels. The final re-ranking stage further refines retrieval precision through contextual similarity calibration. Experiments on DBLP, S2ORC, and the newly constructed Sci-OMRC dataset demonstrate that OMRC-MR consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to 7.2% and 3.8% improvements in Precision@10 and Recall@10, respectively. Additional evaluations confirm that QA-style summarization produces more coherent and factually complete representations. Overall, OMRC-MR provides a unified and interpretable content-based paradigm for scientific paper recommendation, advancing trustworthy and privacy-aware scholarly information retrieval.",

Image translation can help balance datasets but is challenging for ultrasound sub-modalities to date. Here, we present a generative method for ultrasound CFD-greyscale video translation, trained on 54,975 videos and tested on 8,368. The method developed leveraged pixel-wise, adversarial, and perceptual loses and utilized two networks: one for reconstructing anatomic structures and one for denoising to achieve realistic ultrasound imaging. Average pairwise SSIM between synthetic videos and ground truth was 0.91+/-0.04. Synthetic videos performed indistinguishably from real ones in DL classification and segmentation tasks and when evaluated by blinded clinical experts: F1 score was 0.9 for real and 0.89 for synthetic videos; Dice score between real and synthetic segmentation was 0.97. Overall clinician accuracy in distinguishing real vs synthetic videos was 54+/-6% (42-61%), indicating realistic synthetic videos. Although trained only on heart videos, the model worked well on ultrasound spanning several clinical domains (average SSIM 0.91+/-0.05), demonstrating foundational abilities.

        "summary": "This paper examines the role of public interest litigation in promoting accountability for AI and automated decision-making (ADM) in Australia. Since ADM regulatio faces geopolitical headwinds, effective governance will have to rely at least in part on the enforcement of existing laws. Drawing on interviews with Australian public interest litigators, technology policy activists, and technology law scholars, the paper positions public interest litigation as part of a larger ecosystem for transparency, accountability and justice with respect to ADM. It builds on one participants's characterisation of litigation about ADM as an exercise in legal retrofitting: adapting old laws to new circumstances. The paper's primary contribution is to aggregate, organise and present original insights on pragmatic strategies and tactics for effective public interest litigation about ADM. Naturally, it also contends with the limits of these strategies, and of the legal system. Where limits are, however, capable of being overcome, the paper presents findings on urgent needs: the enabling institutional arrangements without which effective litigation and accountability will falter. The paper is relevant to law and technology scholars; individuals and groups harmed by ADM; public interest litigators and technology lawyers; civil society and advocacy organisations; and policymakers.",

        "summary": "Quantitative structure-activity relationship assumes a smooth relationship between molecular structure and biological activity. However, activity cliffs defined as pairs of structurally similar compounds with large potency differences break this continuity. Recent benchmarks targeting activity cliffs have revealed that classical machine learning models with extended connectivity fingerprints outperform graph neural networks. Our analysis shows that graph embeddings fail to adequately separate structurally similar molecules in the embedding space, making it difficult to distinguish between structurally similar but functionally different molecules. Despite this limitation, molecular graph structures are inherently expressive and attractive, as they preserve molecular topology. To preserve the structural representation of molecules as graphs, we propose a new model, GraphCliff, which integrates short- and long-range information through a gating mechanism. Experimental results demonstrate that GraphCliff consistently improves performance on both non-cliff and cliff compounds. Furthermore, layer-wise node embedding analyses reveal reduced over-smoothing and enhanced discriminative power relative to strong baseline graph models.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have substantially influenced various software engineering tasks. Indeed, in the case of software refactoring, traditional LLMs have shown the ability to reduce development time and enhance code quality. However, these LLMs often rely on static, detailed instructions for specific tasks. In contrast, LLM-based agents can dynamically adapt to evolving contexts and autonomously make decisions by interacting with software tools and executing workflows. In this paper, we explore the potential of LLM-based agents in supporting refactoring activities. Specifically, we introduce RefAgent, a multi-agent LLM-based framework for end-to-end software refactoring. RefAgent consists of specialized agents responsible for planning, executing, testing, and iteratively refining refactorings using self-reflection and tool-calling capabilities. We evaluate RefAgent on eight open-source Java projects, comparing its effectiveness against a single-agent approach, a search-based refactoring tool, and historical developer refactorings. Our assessment focuses on: (1) the impact of generated refactorings on software quality, (2) the ability to identify refactoring opportunities, and (3) the contribution of each LLM agent through an ablation study. Our results show that RefAgent achieves a median unit test pass rate of 90%, reduces code smells by a median of 52.5%, and improves key quality attributes (e.g., reusability) by a median of 8.6%. Additionally, it closely aligns with developer refactorings and the search-based tool in identifying refactoring opportunities, attaining a median F1-score of 79.15% and 72.7%, respectively. Compared to single-agent approaches, RefAgent improves the median unit test pass rate by 64.7% and the median compilation success rate by 40.1%. These findings highlight the promise of multi-agent architectures in advancing automated software refactoring.",

        "summary": "This paper presents the first AI/ML system for automating building damage assessment in uncrewed aerial systems (sUAS) imagery to be deployed operationally during federally declared disasters (Hurricanes Debby and Helene). In response to major disasters, sUAS teams are dispatched to collect imagery of the affected areas to assess damage; however, at recent disasters, teams collectively delivered between 47GB and 369GB of imagery per day, representing more imagery than can reasonably be transmitted or interpreted by subject matter experts in the disaster scene, thus delaying response efforts. To alleviate this data avalanche encountered in practice, computer vision and machine learning techniques are necessary. While prior work has been deployed to automatically assess damage in satellite imagery, there is no current state of practice for sUAS-based damage assessment systems, as all known work has been confined to academic settings. This work establishes the state of practice via the development and deployment of models for building damage assessment with sUAS imagery. The model development involved training on the largest known dataset of post-disaster sUAS aerial imagery, containing 21,716 building damage labels, and the operational training of 91 disaster practitioners. The best performing model was deployed during the responses to Hurricanes Debby and Helene, where it assessed a combined 415 buildings in approximately 18 minutes. This work contributes documentation of the actual use of AI/ML for damage assessment during a disaster and lessons learned to the benefit of the AI/ML research and user communities.",

        "summary": "We propose a linear programming (LP) framework for steady-state diffusion and flux optimization on geometric networks. The state variable satisfies a discrete diffusion law on a weighted, oriented graph, where conductances are scaled by edge lengths to preserve geometric fidelity. Boundary potentials act as controls that drive interior fluxes according to a linear network Laplacian. The optimization problem enforces physically meaningful sign and flux-cap constraints at all boundary edges, derived directly from a gradient bound. This yields a finite-dimensional LP whose feasible set is polyhedral, and whose boundedness and solvability follow from simple geometric or algebraic conditions on the network data. We prove that under the absence of negative recession directions--automatically satisfied in the presence of finite box bounds, flux caps, or sign restrictions--the LP admits a global minimizer. Several sufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the feasible region are identified, covering both full-rank and rank-deficient flux maps. The analysis connects classical results such as the Minkowski--Weyl decomposition, Hoffman's bound, and the fundamental theorem of linear programming with modern network-based diffusion modeling. Two large-scale examples illustrate the framework: (i) A typical large stadium in a major modern city, which forms a single connected component with relatively uniform corridor widths, and a (ii) A complex street network emanating from a large, historical city center, which forms a multi-component system.",

Defects can arise at any stage, causing yield loss and ultimately degrading product reliability. Supervised methods require extensive human annotation and struggle with emergent categories and rare, data scarce defects. Clustering-based unsupervised methods often exhibit unstable performance due to missing priors. We propose IC DefectNCD, a support set free framework that leverages Image Intrinsic Priors in IC SEM images for defect detection and novel class discovery. We first develop Self Normal Information Guided IC Defect Detection, aggregating representative normal features via a learnable normal information extractor and using reconstruction residuals to coarsely localize defect regions. To handle saliency variations across defects, we introduce an adaptive binarization strategy that produces stable subimages focused on core defective areas. Finally, we design Self Defect Information Guided IC Defect Classification, which incorporates a soft mask guided attention mechanism to inject spatial defect priors into the teacher student model. This enhances sensitivity to defective regions, suppresses background interference, and enables recognition and classification of unseen defects. We validate the approach on a real world dataset spanning three key fabrication stages and covering 15 defect types. Experiments demonstrate robust performance on both defect detection and unseen defect classification.",

Inspired by neuroscientific evidence that human encodes knowledge as relationship cognitive maps, we introduce Structure-aware Language-Image Pretraining (SLIP). SLIP integrates a structural contrastive loss to align modalities while also modeling relationships between neighboring entities in a structured graph. To support this paradigm, we construct a large-scale Amazon Product Co-purchase Multimodal Graph Dataset, enabling structured cross-modality supervision at scale.

This diversity in objectives, modality, and technical stacks creates an urgent need for a unified framework. To address this gap, this paper systematizes the field by proposing a Four-Quadrant Technical Taxonomy for AI companion applications. The framework is structured along two critical axes: Virtual vs. Embodied and Emotional Companionship vs. Functional Augmentation. Quadrant I (Virtual Companionship) explores virtual idols, romantic companions, and story characters, introducing a four-layer technical framework to analyze their challenges in maintaining long-term emotional consistency. Quadrant II (Functional Virtual Assistants) analyzes AI applica- tions in work, gaming, and mental health, highlighting the shift from \"feeling\" to \"thinking and acting\" and pinpointing key technologies like enterprise RAG and on-device inference. Quadrants III & IV (Embodied Intelligence) shift from the virtual to the physical world, analyzing home robots and vertical-domain assistants, revealing core challenges in symbol grounding, data privacy, and ethical liability. This taxonomy provides not only a systematic map for researchers and developers to navigate the complex persona design space but also a basis for policymakers to identify and address the unique risks inherent in different application scenarios.",

We address this limitation by learning a data-driven mapping from band-limited to broadband spectrogram of radio-frequency (RF) lines. To this end, a variation of Tiny Vision Transform (ViT) auto-encoder is trained on simulation data using a curriculum-weighted loss. On heterogeneous speckle-cyst phantoms, the network reduces image-domain MSE by 90 percent, boosts PSNR by 6.7 dB, and raises SSIM to 0.965 compared with the narrow-band input. It also sharpens point-target rows in a completely unseen resolution phantom, demonstrating strong out-of-distribution generalisation without sacrificing frame rate or phase information. These results indicate that a purely software upgrade can endow installed narrow-band probes with broadband-like performance, potentially widening access to high-resolution ultrasound in resource-constrained settings.",

        "summary": "Data augmentation is widely used in vision to introduce variation and mitigate overfitting, through enabling models to learn invariant properties, such as spatial invariance. However, these properties are not fully captured by data augmentation alone, since it attempts to learn the property on transformations of the training data only. We propose generative hints, a training methodology that directly enforces known invariances in the entire input space. Our approach leverages a generative model trained on the training set to approximate the input distribution and generate unlabeled images, which we refer to as virtual examples. These virtual examples are used to enforce functional properties known as hints. In generative hints, although the training dataset is fully labeled, the model is trained in a semi-supervised manner on both the classification and hint objectives, using the unlabeled virtual examples to guide the model in learning the desired hint. Across datasets, architectures, and loss functions, generative hints consistently outperform standard data augmentation when learning the same property. On popular fine-grained visual classification benchmarks, we achieved up to 1.78% top-1 accuracy improvement (0.63% on average) over fine-tuned models with data augmentation and an average performance boost of 1.286% on the CheXpert X-ray dataset.",

        "summary": "While the possibility of reaching human-like Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains controversial, the likelihood that the future will be characterized by a society with a growing presence of autonomous machines is high. Autonomous AI agents are already deployed and active across several industries and digital environments and alongside human-human and human-machine interactions, machine-machine interactions are poised to become increasingly prevalent. Given these developments, I argue that criminology must begin to address the implications of this transition for crime and social control. Drawing on Actor-Network Theory and Woolgar's decades-old call for a sociology of machines -- frameworks that acquire renewed relevance with the rise of generative AI agents -- I contend that criminologists should move beyond conceiving AI solely as a tool. Instead, AI agents should be recognized as entities with agency encompassing computational, social, and legal dimensions. Building on the literature on AI safety, I thus examine the risks associated with the rise of multi-agent AI systems, proposing a dual taxonomy to characterize the channels through which interactions among AI agents may generate deviant, unlawful, or criminal outcomes. I then advance and discuss four key questions that warrant theoretical and empirical attention: (1) Can we assume that machines will simply mimic humans? (2) Will crime theories developed for humans suffice to explain deviant or criminal behaviors emerging from interactions between autonomous AI agents? (3) What types of criminal behaviors will be affected first? (4) How might this unprecedented societal shift impact policing? These questions underscore the urgent need for criminologists to theoretically and empirically engage with the implications of multi-agent AI systems for the study of crime and play a more active role in debates on AI safety and governance.",

These AI components are often implemented as AI Agents, offering more autonomy than a plain integration of Large Language Models (LLMs), moving from a Model-as-a-Service paradigm to an Agent-as-a-Service one, bringing new challenges to the development of smart software systems. Indeed, while support for the design, implementation, and deployment of those agents exist, the specification of Quality of Service (QoS) and definition of Service Level Agreements (SLAs) aspects for those agents, important to ensure the quality of the resulting systems, remains an open challenge. Part of this is due to the difficulty to clearly define quality in the context of AI components, resulting in a lack of consensus on how to best approach Quality Assurance (QA) for these types of systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes both a quality model for AI agents based on the ISO/IEC 25010 standard, and a domain specific language to support the definition of SLAs for the services provided by these AI agents.",

        "summary": "Conventional multi-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) systems capture cardiac signals from a fixed set of anatomical viewpoints defined by lead placement. However, certain cardiac conditions (e.g., Brugada syndrome) require additional, non-standard viewpoints to reveal diagnostically critical patterns that may be absent in standard leads. To systematically overcome this limitation, Nef-Net was recently introduced to reconstruct a continuous electrocardiac field, enabling virtual observation of ECG signals from arbitrary views (termed Electrocardio Panorama). Despite its promise, Nef-Net operates under idealized assumptions and faces in-the-wild challenges, such as long-duration ECG modeling, robustness to device-specific signal artifacts, and suboptimal lead placement calibration. This paper presents NEF-NET+, an enhanced framework for realistic panoramic ECG synthesis that supports arbitrary-length signal synthesis from any desired view, generalizes across ECG devices, and com- pensates for operator-induced deviations in electrode placement. These capabilities are enabled by a newly designed model architecture that performs direct view transformation, incorporating a workflow comprising offline pretraining, device calibration tuning steps as well as an on-the-fly calibration step for patient-specific adaptation. To rigorously evaluate panoramic ECG synthesis, we construct a new Electrocardio Panorama benchmark, called Panobench, comprising 5367 recordings with 48-view per subject, capturing the full spatial variability of cardiac electrical activity. Experimental results show that NEF-NET+ delivers substantial improvements over Nef-Net, yielding an increase of around 6 dB in PSNR in real-world setting. The code and Panobench will be released in a subsequent publication.",

        "summary": "Programming languages can benefit from one another by utilizing a language model for software engineering tasks. Full fine-tuning and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Code Language Models (Code-LMs) has been explored for multilingual knowledge transfer. AdapterFusion is a PEFT architecture that aims to enhance task performance by leveraging information from multiple programming languages, but primarily focuses on the target programming language. In our previous work, we proposed AdvFusion, a novel PEFT-based approach that effectively learns from other programming languages before adapting to the target task. Though previous experiments showed that AdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion and LoRA, it was applied on pre-trained Code-LMs and was limited to only two tasks, code summarization and method name prediction. In this study, we expanded our work and investigated AdvFusion on Code Large Language Models (Code-LLMs), considering three new tasks: code generation, code translation, and commit message generation. We observed that different Code-LLMs/tasks exhibit different characteristics. In code generation, AdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion but not other PEFT methods (LoRA, Compacter, and TaskAdapter). In commit message generation, AdapterFusion performed better than AdvFusion, and contrary to code generation, we found that the other PEFT methods do not have better performance. In code translation, AdvFusion performed worse than AdapterFusion overall, with the performance gap marginally widening as the model size increases. However, consistent with code generation, other PEFT methods showed better performance.",

Existing consensus protocols such as Proof-of-Work (PoW) and Proof-of-Stake (PoS) either consume excessive resources or risk centralization. This paper proposes \\textit{Proof-of-Spiking-Neurons (PoSN)}, a neuromorphic consensus protocol inspired by spiking neural networks. PoSN encodes transactions as spike trains, elects leaders through competitive firing dynamics, and finalizes blocks via neural synchronization, enabling parallel and event-driven consensus with minimal energy overhead. A hybrid system architecture is implemented on neuromorphic platforms, supported by simulation frameworks such as Nengo and PyNN. Experimental results show significant gains in energy efficiency, throughput, and convergence compared to PoB and PoR. PoSN establishes a foundation for sustainable, adaptive blockchains suitable for IoT, edge, and large-scale distributed systems.",

Existing integrity approaches are often heavy or slow for modern LLMs. LM-Fix runs a short test-vector pass and uses hash-guided checks to detect bit-flip faults, then repairs them locally without a full reload. Across multiple models, it detects over 94% of single-bit flips at TVL=200 and nearly 100% of multi-bit flips with approximately 1% to 7.7% runtime overhead; recovery is more than 100x faster than reloading.

In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems. To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights. These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in 2D large-scale and 3D volume electron microscopy have stimulated the rapid development of nanoscale functional analysis at the tissue and organ levels. Digitizing the cell by mapping the intricate organellar networks into its physiological and pathological textures will revolutionarize the contents of cell atlases. To meet the requirements of characterizing intracellular organelles and their interactions within defined cellular cohorts at tissue level, we have developed DeepOrganelle. It adopts a lightweighted Mask2Former frameworks as a universal segmentor and is capable of segmenting and extracting organelles within different cell types, performing statistical quantitative analysis, as well as visualizing and quantifying the spatial distribution of organelle morphologies and interactions across different cell types at tissue scales. Using DeepOrganelle, we systemically perform cross-scale quantification of membrane contact sites(MCSs) dynamics across the progression of the seminiferous epithelial cycle, covering 12 distinct developmental stages and 24 statuses of germ cells. DeepOrganelle uncovers the spatiotemporal gradient of the germ cell differentiation atlas according to different types of organelles and their interactions. Noticeably, it discovers a waved pattern of mitochondria(Mito)-endoplasmic reticulum(ER) contact with a significant increase specifically at Stage X pachytene preceding the transition to diplotene, which aligns well with a newly reported experiment that mitochondrial metabolic proteins like PDHA2 are essential for this transition by maintaining ATP supply for double-strand break(DSB) repair. DeepOrganelle also observes a dynamic restructuring of the blood-testis barrier and stage-specific reorganization of organelle topography in Sertoli cells from preleptotene to leptotene phases of prophase I.",

        "summary": "Test-time scaling without interpreter feedback is essential for real-world code generation scenarios where test cases are not readily available. While existing paradigms often rely on either greedy exploitation (i.e., iterative refinement) or stochastic exploration (i.e., relying on sample-based voting or reranking mechanisms), the balance between these two dimensions remains underexplored. To investigate the LLM's intrinsic ability to balance exploitation and exploration, we introduce SELF-REDRAFT, a framework built upon Self-Refine that encourages the model to propose new drafts for solutions that are fundamentally flawed. Our results show that SELF-REDRAFT consistently achieves better performance than Self-Refine when converged under the same maximum number of iterations. Still, we observe that significant room for improvement remains, largely due to two core aspects of current self-redraft capabilities: constrained capacity for generating instructive feedback and fragile discriminative judgment. We also find that balancing strategies vary notably across different LLMs, reflecting distinct, model-specific behaviors. Overall, our study establishes a baseline for intrinsic exploration-exploitation balancing in test-time scaling and identifies feedback and discrimination as key areas with potential for future advances.",

        "summary": "The advancement of next-generation Wi-Fi technology heavily relies on sensing capabilities, which play a pivotal role in enabling sophisticated applications. In response to the growing demand for large-scale deployments, contemporary Wi-Fi sensing systems strive to achieve high-precision perception while maintaining minimal bandwidth consumption and antenna count requirements. Remarkably, various AI-driven perception technologies have demonstrated the ability to surpass the traditional resolution limitations imposed by radar theory. However, the theoretical underpinnings of this phenomenon have not been thoroughly investigated in existing research. In this study, we found that under hardware-constrained conditions, the performance gains brought by AI to Wi-Fi sensing systems primarily originate from two aspects: prior information and temporal correlation. Prior information enables the AI to generate plausible details based on vague input, while temporal correlation helps reduce the upper bound of sensing error. We developed an AI-based Wi-Fi sensing system using a single transceiver pair and designed experiments focusing on human pose estimation and indoor localization to validate the theoretical claims. The results confirm the performance gains contributed by temporal correlation and prior information.",

Increasing clinical workload often limits attendings' ability to provide guidance. This study evaluates a HIPAA-compliant GPT-4o system that delivers automated feedback on breast imaging reports drafted by residents in real clinical settings. Methods: We analyzed 5,000 resident-attending report pairs from routine practice at a multi-site U.S. health system. GPT-4o was prompted with clinical instructions to identify common errors and provide feedback. A reader study using 100 report pairs was conducted. Four attending radiologists and four residents independently reviewed each pair, determined whether predefined error types were present, and rated GPT-4o's feedback as helpful or not. Agreement between GPT and readers was assessed using percent match. Inter-reader reliability was measured with Krippendorff's alpha. Educational value was measured as the proportion of cases rated helpful. Results: Three common error types were identified: (1) omission or addition of key findings, (2) incorrect use or omission of technical descriptors, and (3) final assessment inconsistent with findings. GPT-4o showed strong agreement with attending consensus: 90.5%, 78.3%, and 90.4% across error types. Inter-reader reliability showed moderate variability ({\\alpha} = 0.767, 0.595, 0.567), and replacing a human reader with GPT-4o did not significantly affect agreement ({\\Delta} = -0.004 to 0.002). GPT's feedback was rated helpful in most cases: 89.8%, 83.0%, and 92.0%. Discussion: ChatGPT-4o can reliably identify key educational errors.

The framework highlights the importance of stakeholder participation in its development, ensuring that training modules are customized to address the specific needs of different user groups. The iterative approach of the framework supports ongoing refinement through user feedback and performance data, thus improving the overall effectiveness of risk training initiatives. This work outlines the methodological phases involved in the framework's implementation, including i) user flow mapping, ii) scenario selection, and iii) performance evaluation, with a focus on the pilot application in Senigallia, Italy.
