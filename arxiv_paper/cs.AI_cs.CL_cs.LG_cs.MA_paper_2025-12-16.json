        "summary": "Today, a lot of research on language models is focused on large, general-purpose models. However, many NLP pipelines only require models with a well-defined, small set of capabilities. While large models are capable of performing the tasks of those smaller models, they are simply not fast enough to process large amounts of data or offer real-time responses. Furthermore, they often use unnecessarily large amounts of energy, leading to sustainability concerns and problems when deploying them on battery-powered devices. In our work, we show how to train small models for such efficiency-critical applications. As opposed to many off-the-shelf NLP pipelines, our models use modern training techniques such as distillation, and offer support for low-resource languages. We call our models TiME (Tiny Monolingual Encoders) and comprehensively evaluate them on a range of common NLP tasks, observing an improved trade-off between benchmark performance on one hand, and throughput, latency and energy consumption on the other. Along the way, we show that distilling monolingual models from multilingual teachers is possible, and likewise distilling models with absolute positional embeddings from teachers with relative positional embeddings.",

Following the evolution from MMMU to MMMU-Pro, JMMMU-Pro extends JMMMU by composing the question image and question text into a single image, thereby creating a benchmark that requires integrated visual-textual understanding through visual perception. To build JMMMU-Pro, we propose Vibe Benchmark Construction, a methodology in which an image generative model (e.g., Nano Banana Pro) produces candidate visual questions, and humans verify the outputs and, when necessary, regenerate with adjusted prompts to ensure quality. By leveraging Nano Banana Pro's highly realistic image generation capabilities and its ability to embed clean Japanese text, we construct a high-quality benchmark at low cost, covering a wide range of background and layout designs. Experimental results show that all open-source LMMs struggle substantially with JMMMU-Pro, underscoring JMMMU-Pro as an important benchmark for guiding future efforts in the open-source community. We believe that JMMMU-Pro provides a more rigorous evaluation tool for assessing the Japanese capabilities of LMMs and that our Vibe Benchmark Construction also offers an efficient guideline for future development of image-based VQA benchmarks.",

Most efforts to date have centered on basic encoder architectures; they remain insufficient for Nepali-specific text generation. This study presents a GPT-2-based Nepali language model trained using several training strategies inspired by GPT-3, including optimized learning rate schedules, batch scaling, and architectural refinements. A custom 16k Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenizer was trained exclusively on Nepali text to ensure more consistent segmentation and improved input representation. The model was pretrained on a combined dataset comprising a 10.75GB cleaned NepBERTa corpus and additional web-scraped Nepali news articles. FlashAttention was integrated to reduce memory usage and stabilize training. After two epochs, the model achieved a training loss of 3.168177, a validation loss of 3.081982, and a final perplexity of 21.80, demonstrating its capability to generate coherent Nepali news-style text.",

The framework instruction-tunes compact chat models using parameter-efficient LoRA adapters with 4-bit quantization under a resource-adaptive training setup. A dialogue-based data pipeline explicitly preserves persona cues, ensuring consistent behavioral alignment across generated responses. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of 3,568 synthetic survey responses spanning ten domains and 433 distinct personas, enabling controlled instruction tuning and systematic multi-domain evaluation. We evaluate the generated responses using a multi-metric evaluation suite that combines standard text generation metrics, including BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore, with survey-specific metrics designed to assess structural coherence, stylistic consistency, and sentiment alignment.Experimental results show that compact models such as TinyLlama 1.1B and Phi-2 achieve performance comparable to larger 7B to 8B baselines, with a highest BLEU score of 0.090 and ROUGE-1 of 0.429. These findings demonstrate that persona-conditioned fine-tuning enables small language models to generate reliable and coherent synthetic survey data. The proposed framework provides an efficient and reproducible approach for survey data generation, supporting scalable evaluation while facilitating bias analysis through transparent and open protocols.",

The benchmark comprises 10,450 samples generated through a rigorous annotation pipeline, where legal experts label and cross-validate each instance using our annotation system to ensure every sample is grounded in authoritative legal documents and mirrors real-world legal assistant workflows, including general legal questions and answers, retrieval-augmented generation, multi-step reasoning, and scenario-based problem solving tailored to Vietnamese law.

Autoregressive modeling has been a popular approach, partly because of its training efficiency; however, that comes at the cost of sensitivity to overfitting. On the other hand, masked-diffusion models are less efficient to train while being more resilient to overfitting. In this work, we demonstrate that dual-objective training achieves the best of both worlds. To derive the optimal ratio between both objectives, we train and evaluate 50 language models under varying levels of data repetition. We show that it is optimal to combine both objectives under all evaluated settings and that the optimal ratio is similar whether targeting autoregressive or masked-diffusion downstream performance.",

Existing parameter-efficient approaches such as pruning and quantization mainly compress pretrained models without enhancing architectural capacity, thereby hitting the representational ceiling of the base model. In this work, we propose VersatileFFN, a novel feed-forward network (FFN) that enables flexible reuse of parameters in both width and depth dimensions within a fixed parameter budget. Inspired by the dual-process theory of cognition, VersatileFFN comprises two adaptive pathways: a width-versatile path that generates a mixture of sub-experts from a single shared FFN, mimicking sparse expert routing without increasing parameters, and a depth-versatile path that recursively applies the same FFN to emulate deeper processing for complex tokens. A difficulty-aware gating dynamically balances the two pathways, steering \"easy\" tokens through the efficient width-wise route and allocating deeper iterative refinement to \"hard\" tokens. Crucially, both pathways reuse the same parameters, so all additional capacity comes from computation rather than memory. Experiments across diverse benchmarks and model scales demonstrate the effectiveness of the method. The code will be available at https://github.com/huawei-noah/noah-research/tree/master/VersatileFFN.",

Existing approaches of quantization-aware training (QAT) further suffer from weight training costs. We propose SASQ: a lightweight QAT framework specifically tailored for activation quantization factors. SASQ exclusively optimizes only the quantization factors (without changing pre-trained weights), enabling static inference with high accuracy while maintaining deployment efficiency. SASQ adaptively truncates some outliers, thereby reducing the difficulty of quantization while preserving the distributional characteristics of the activations. SASQ not only surpasses existing SOTA quantization schemes but also outperforms the corresponding FP16 models.

To address this challenge, we introduce the Step-Tagging framework, a lightweight sentence-classifier enabling real-time annotation of the type of reasoning steps that an LRM is generating. To monitor reasoning behaviors, we introduced ReasonType: a novel taxonomy of reasoning steps. Building on this framework, we demonstrated that online monitoring of the count of specific steps can produce effective interpretable early stopping criteria of LRM inferences. We evaluate the Step-tagging framework on three open-source reasoning models across standard benchmark datasets: MATH500, GSM8K, AIME and non-mathematical tasks (GPQA and MMLU-Pro). We achieve 20 to 50\\% token reduction while maintaining comparable accuracy to standard generation, with largest gains observed on more computation-heavy tasks.

We compare the LLM's output to household survey data and official statistics, mimicking the information set and demographic characteristics of the Bank of England's Inflation Attitudes Survey (IAS). Our quasi-experimental design exploits the timing of GPT's training cut-off in September 2021 which means it has no knowledge of the subsequent UK inflation surge. We find that GPT tracks aggregate survey projections and official statistics at short horizons. At a disaggregated level, GPT replicates key empirical regularities of households' inflation perceptions, particularly for income, housing tenure, and social class. A novel Shapley value decomposition of LLM outputs suited for the synthetic survey setting provides well-defined insights into the drivers of model outputs linked to prompt content. We find that GPT demonstrates a heightened sensitivity to food inflation information similar to that of human respondents. However, we also find that it lacks a consistent model of consumer price inflation. More generally, our approach could be used to evaluate the behaviour of LLMs for use in the social sciences, to compare different models, or to assist in survey design.",

Existing compression techniques often disrupt local coherence through discrete token removal or rely on implicit latent encoding that suffers from positional bias and incompatibility with closed-source APIs. To address these limitations, we introduce the EDU-based Context Compressor, a novel explicit compression framework designed to preserve both global structure and fine-grained details. Our approach reformulates context compression as a structure-then-select process. First, our LingoEDU transforms linear text into a structural relation tree of Elementary Discourse Units (EDUs) which are anchored strictly to source indices to eliminate hallucination. Second, a lightweight ranking module selects query-relevant sub-trees for linearization. To rigorously evaluate structural understanding, we release StructBench, a manually annotated dataset of 248 diverse documents. Empirical results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art structural prediction accuracy and significantly outperforms frontier LLMs while reducing costs. Furthermore, our structure-aware compression substantially enhances performance across downstream tasks ranging from long-context tasks to complex Deep Search scenarios.",

Nawatl is an Amerindian language (it is a National Language of Mexico) of the $π$-language type, i.e. a language with few digital resources. For this reason the corpora available for the learning of Large Language Models (LLMs) are virtually non-existent, posing a significant challenge. The goal is to produce a substantial number of syntactically valid artificial Nawatl sentences and thereby to expand the corpora for the purpose of learning non contextual embeddings. For this objective, we introduce two new Nawatl CFGs and use them in generative mode. Using these grammars, it is possible to expand Nawatl corpus significantly and subsequently to use it to learn embeddings and to evaluate their relevance in a sentences semantic similarity task. The results show an improvement compared to the results obtained using only the original corpus without artificial expansion, and also demonstrate that economic embeddings often perform better than some LLMs.",

        "summary": "Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is often limited by the memory available on commodity GPUs. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods such as QLoRA reduce the number of trainable parameters, yet still incur high memory usage induced by the backward pass in the full model. We revisit Ladder Side Tuning (LST), a rarely explored PEFT technique that adds a lightweight side network, and show that it matches QLoRA's compute scaling slope while cutting peak memory by 50\\%. Across different downstream benchmarks spanning natural language understanding, mathematical and LLM-critic tasks, LST has competitive performance with QLoRA's accuracy on average while being much more memory-efficient. This efficiency enables fine-tuning of 7B-parameter models on a single 12 GB consumer GPU with 2k-token contexts, requiring no gradient checkpointing\\textemdash conditions under which QLoRA exhausts memory. Beyond memory efficiency, we also establish scaling laws showing that LST scales similarly to QLoRA. We exploit Ladder's architectural flexibility by introducing xLadder, a depth-extended variant that increases effective depth via cross-connections and shortens chain-of-thought (CoT) at fixed parameter count. Ladder is strong when memory is the bottleneck; xLadder builds on this by enabling deeper reasoning without additional memory overhead.",

        "summary": "Translating from a standard language to its regional dialects is a significant NLP challenge due to scarce data and linguistic variation, a problem prominent in the Bengali language. This paper proposes and compares two novel RAG pipelines for standard-to-dialectal Bengali translation. The first, a Transcript-Based Pipeline, uses large dialect sentence contexts from audio transcripts. The second, a more effective Standardized Sentence-Pairs Pipeline, utilizes structured local\\_dialect:standard\\_bengali sentence pairs. We evaluated both pipelines across six Bengali dialects and multiple LLMs using BLEU, ChrF, WER, and BERTScore. Our findings show that the sentence-pair pipeline consistently outperforms the transcript-based one, reducing Word Error Rate (WER) from 76\\% to 55\\% for the Chittagong dialect. Critically, this RAG approach enables smaller models (e.g., Llama-3.1-8B) to outperform much larger models (e.g., GPT-OSS-120B), demonstrating that a well-designed retrieval strategy can be more crucial than model size. This work contributes an effective, fine-tuning-free solution for low-resource dialect translation, offering a practical blueprint for preserving linguistic diversity.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as intelligent agents. Their multi-stage workflows, which alternate between local computation and calls to external network services like Web APIs, introduce a mismatch in their execution pattern and the scheduling granularity of existing inference systems such as vLLM. Existing systems typically focus on per-segment optimization which prevents them from minimizing the end-to-end latency of the complete agentic workflow, i.e., the global Job Completion Time (JCT) over the entire request lifecycle. To address this limitation, we propose Astraea, a service engine designed to shift the optimization from local segments to the global request lifecycle. Astraea employs a state-aware, hierarchical scheduling algorithm that integrates a request's historical state with future predictions. It dynamically classifies requests by their I/O and compute intensive nature and uses an enhanced HRRN policy to balance efficiency and fairness. Astraea also implements an adaptive KV cache manager that intelligently handles the agent state during I/O waits based on the system memory pressure. Extensive experiments show that Astraea reduces average JCT by up to 25.5\\% compared to baseline methods. Moreover, our approach demonstrates strong robustness and stability under high load across various model scales.",

We introduce CogMem, a cognitively inspired, memory-augmented LLM architecture that supports sustained iterative reasoning through structured, persistent memory. CogMem incorporates three layers: a Long-Term Memory (LTM) that consolidates cross-session reasoning strategies; a Direct Access (DA) memory that maintains session-level notes and retrieves relevant long-term memories; and a Focus of Attention (FoA) mechanism that dynamically reconstructs concise, task-relevant context at each turn. Experiments on TurnBench show that this layered design mitigates reasoning failures, controls context growth, and improves consistency across extended reasoning chains, moving toward more reliable, human-like reasoning in LLMs.",

The model is Transformer-based and operates at the frame level, jointly trained with auxiliary tasks on approximately 300 hours of dyadic conversations. Across all three languages, the multilingual model matches or surpasses monolingual baselines, indicating that it learns both language-universal cues and language-specific timing patterns. Zero-shot transfer with two-language training remains limited, underscoring substantive cross-lingual differences. Perturbation analyses reveal distinct cue usage: Japanese relies more on short-term linguistic information, whereas English and Chinese are more sensitive to silence duration and prosodic variation; multilingual training encourages shared yet adaptable representations and reduces overreliance on pitch in Chinese. A context-length study further shows that Japanese is relatively robust to shorter contexts, while Chinese benefits markedly from longer contexts. Finally, we integrate the trained model into a real-time processing software, demonstrating CPU-only inference. Together, these findings provide a unified model and empirical evidence for how backchannel timing differs across languages, informing the design of more natural, culturally-aware spoken dialogue systems.",

Existing sparse attention methods alleviate this issue but face trade-offs: training-based methods are costly and cannot be directly applied as acceleration plugins for other models, while inference-time methods often compromise efficiency or cross-modal generality. To address these limitations, we present UniSparse, a unified mechanism that introduces the notion of composite tokens--compact representations that aggregate multi-granularity contextual information. Building on this abstraction, UniSparse dynamically constructs sparse attention through multi-granularity compression and block-level selection, enabling efficient and hardware-friendly execution on GPU. Across multiple modalities and tasks ranging from synthetic benchmarks to real-world applications, UniSparse consistently surpasses state-of-the-art sparse attention methods (e.g., MInference, XAttention, FlexPrefill) in both accuracy and efficiency, achieving $\\ge$ 99% of full-attention accuracy and up to 2.61$\\times$ faster attention computation than FlashAttention.",

        "summary": "Diffusion language models (dLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm that enables parallel, non-autoregressive generation, but their learning efficiency lags behind that of autoregressive (AR) language models when trained from scratch. To this end, we study AR-to-dLM conversion to transform pretrained AR models into efficient dLMs that excel in speed while preserving AR models' task accuracy. We achieve this by identifying limitations in the attention patterns and objectives of existing AR-to-dLM methods and then proposing principles and methodologies for more effective AR-to-dLM conversion. Specifically, we first systematically compare different attention patterns and find that maintaining pretrained AR weight distributions is critical for effective AR-to-dLM conversion. As such, we introduce a continuous pretraining scheme with a block-wise attention pattern, which remains causal across blocks while enabling bidirectional modeling within each block. We find that this approach can better preserve pretrained AR models' weight distributions than fully bidirectional modeling, in addition to its known benefit of enabling KV caching, and leads to a win-win in accuracy and efficiency. Second, to mitigate the training-test gap in mask token distributions (uniform vs. highly left-to-right), we propose a position-dependent token masking strategy that assigns higher masking probabilities to later tokens during training to better mimic test-time behavior. Leveraging this framework, we conduct extensive studies of dLMs' attention patterns, training dynamics, and other design choices, providing actionable insights into scalable AR-to-dLM conversion. These studies lead to the Efficient-DLM family, which outperforms state-of-the-art AR models and dLMs, e.g., our Efficient-DLM 8B achieves +5.4%/+2.7% higher accuracy with 4.5x/2.7x higher throughput compared to Dream 7B and Qwen3 4B, respectively.",

Prior work introduces the concept of \"effective depth\", arguing that deeper models fail to fully utilize their layers for meaningful computation. Building on this, we systematically study how effective depth varies with model scale, training type, and task difficulty. First, we analyze the model behavior of Qwen-2.5 family (1.5B-32B) and find that while the number of effective layers grows with model size, the effective depth ratio remains stable. Besides, comparisons between base and corresponding long-CoT models show no increase in effective depth, suggesting that improved reasoning stems from longer context rather than deeper per-token computation. Furthermore, evaluations across tasks of varying difficulty indicate that models do not dynamically use more layers for harder problems. Our results suggest that current LLMs underuse available depth across scales, training paradigms and tasks of varying difficulties, pointing out research opportunities on increasing the layer utilization rate of LLMs, model pruning, and early exiting.

The method introduces a candidate span generation mechanism and structured attention modeling to achieve unified modeling of entity boundaries, hierarchical relationships, and cross-dependencies. The model first uses a pretrained language model to obtain context-aware semantic representations, then captures multi-granular entity span features through candidate representation combinations, and introduces hierarchical structural constraints during decoding to ensure consistency between semantics and structure. To enhance stability in complex scenarios, the model jointly optimizes classification loss and structural consistency loss, maintaining high recognition accuracy under multi-entity co-occurrence and long-sentence dependency conditions. Experiments conducted on the ACE 2005 dataset demonstrate significant improvements in Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score, particularly in nested and overlapping entity recognition, where the model shows stronger boundary localization and structural modeling capability. This study verifies the effectiveness of structure-aware decoding in complex semantic extraction tasks, provides a new perspective for developing language models with hierarchical understanding, and establishes a methodological foundation for high-precision information extraction.",

Further, we release the dataset with both English labels and translated label sets in the respective target languages because we observe that the performance of current state-of-the-art models drops by 0.02 to 0.09 F1 when evaluated using target language labels instead of English ones.

The model loses ability to order acoustic encodings due to permutation invariance of keys and values in cross-attention. We propose four modifications: (1) injecting explicit absolute positional encodings into cross-attention for each decoded segment, (2) long-form training with extended acoustic context to eliminate implicit absolute position encoding, (3) segment concatenation to cover diverse segmentations needed during training, and (4) semantic segmentation to align AED-decoded segments with training segments.

While RecGPT-V1 successfully pioneered this paradigm by integrating LLM-based reasoning into user interest mining and item tag prediction, it suffers from four fundamental limitations: (1) computational inefficiency and cognitive redundancy across multiple reasoning routes; (2) insufficient explanation diversity in fixed-template generation; (3) limited generalization under supervised learning paradigms; and (4) simplistic outcome-focused evaluation that fails to match human standards. To address these challenges, we present RecGPT-V2 with four key innovations. First, a Hierarchical Multi-Agent System restructures intent reasoning through coordinated collaboration, eliminating cognitive duplication while enabling diverse intent coverage. Combined with Hybrid Representation Inference that compresses user-behavior contexts, our framework reduces GPU consumption by 60% and improves exclusive recall from 9.39% to 10.99%. Second, a Meta-Prompting framework dynamically generates contextually adaptive prompts, improving explanation diversity by +7.3%. Third, constrained reinforcement learning mitigates multi-reward conflicts, achieving +24.1% improvement in tag prediction and +13.0% in explanation acceptance. Fourth, an Agent-as-a-Judge framework decomposes assessment into multi-step reasoning, improving human preference alignment. Online A/B tests on Taobao demonstrate significant improvements: +2.98% CTR, +3.71% IPV, +2.19% TV, and +11.46% NER.

Drawing on Cognitive Load Theory (CLT), we argue that this uninformative structure increases extraneous cognitive load, consuming finite working memory capacity that should be allocated to deep reasoning and attention allocation. To address this, we propose RePo, a novel mechanism that reduces extraneous load via context re-positioning. Unlike standard approaches, RePo utilizes a differentiable module, $f_φ$, to assign token positions that capture contextual dependencies, rather than replying on pre-defined integer range. By continually pre-training on the OLMo-2 1B backbone, we demonstrate that RePo significantly enhances performance on tasks involving noisy contexts, structured data, and longer context length, while maintaining competitive performance on general short-context tasks. Detailed analysis reveals that RePo successfully allocate higher attention to distant but relevant information, assign positions in dense and non-linear space, and capture the intrinsic structure of the input context.

        "summary": "The advent of large language models is contributing to the emergence of novel approaches that promise to better tackle the challenge of generating structured queries, such as SPARQL queries, from natural language. However, these new approaches mostly focus on response accuracy over a single source while ignoring other evaluation criteria, such as federated query capability over distributed data stores, as well as runtime and cost to generate SPARQL queries. Consequently, they are often not production-ready or easy to deploy over (potentially federated) knowledge graphs with good accuracy. To mitigate these issues, in this paper, we extend our previous work and describe and systematically evaluate SPARQL-LLM, an open-source and triplestore-agnostic approach, powered by lightweight metadata, that generates SPARQL queries from natural language text. First, we describe its architecture, which consists of dedicated components for metadata indexing, prompt building, and query generation and execution. Then, we evaluate it based on a state-of-the-art challenge with multilingual questions, and a collection of questions from three of the most prevalent knowledge graphs within the field of bioinformatics. Our results demonstrate a substantial increase of 24% in the F1 Score on the state-of-the-art challenge, adaptability to high-resource languages such as English and Spanish, as well as ability to form complex and federated bioinformatics queries. Furthermore, we show that SPARQL-LLM is up to 36x faster than other systems participating in the challenge, while costing a maximum of $0.01 per question, making it suitable for real-time, low-cost text-to-SPARQL applications.

        "summary": "The practical deployment of Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) systems is fundamentally challenged by significant performance degradation in real-world environments, characterized by unpredictable acoustic noise and visual interference. This dissertation posits that a systematic, hierarchical approach is essential to overcome these challenges, achieving the robust scalability at the representation, architecture, and system levels. At the representation level, we investigate methods for building a unified model that learns audio-visual features inherently robust to diverse real-world corruptions, thereby enabling generalization to new environments without specialized modules. To address architectural scalability, we explore how to efficiently expand model capacity while ensuring the adaptive and reliable use of multimodal inputs, developing a framework that intelligently allocates computational resources based on the input characteristics. Finally, at the system level, we present methods to expand the system's functionality through modular integration with large-scale foundation models, leveraging their powerful cognitive and generative capabilities to maximize final recognition accuracy. By systematically providing solutions at each of these three levels, this dissertation aims to build a next-generation, robust, and scalable AVSR system with high reliability in real-world applications.",

HyperVL adopts an image-tiling strategy to cap peak memory usage and incorporates two novel techniques: (1) a Visual Resolution Compressor (VRC) that adaptively predicts optimal encoding resolutions to eliminate redundant computation, and (2) Dual Consistency Learning (DCL), which aligns multi-scale ViT encoders within a unified framework, enabling dynamic switching between visual branches under a shared LLM. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyperVL achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of comparable size across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, it significantly significantly reduces latency and power consumption on real mobile devices, demonstrating its practicality for on-device multimodal inference.",

We introduce Materials Agents for Simulation and Theory in Electronic-structure Reasoning (MASTER), an active learning framework where large language models autonomously design, execute, and interpret atomistic simulations. In MASTER, a multimodal system translates natural language into density functional theory workflows, while higher-level reasoning agents guide discovery through a hierarchy of strategies, including a single agent baseline and three multi-agent approaches: peer review, triage-ranking, and triage-forms. Across two chemical applications, CO adsorption on Cu-surface transition metal (M) adatoms and on M-N-C catalysts, reasoning-driven exploration reduces required atomistic simulations by up to 90% relative to trial-and-error selection. Reasoning trajectories reveal chemically grounded decisions that cannot be explained by stochastic sampling or semantic bias. Altogether, multi-agent collaboration accelerates materials discovery and marks a new paradigm for autonomous scientific exploration.",

These include the cumulative latency of sequential model inference and the quadratic ($\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$) computational complexity that renders multi-user video conferencing applications unscalable. This paper proposes and evaluates a practical system-level framework designed to mitigate these critical bottlenecks. The proposed architecture incorporates a turn-taking mechanism to reduce computational complexity from quadratic to linear in multi-user scenarios, and a segmented processing protocol to manage inference latency for a perceptually real-time experience. We implement a proof-of-concept pipeline and conduct a rigorous performance analysis across a multi-tiered hardware setup, including commodity (NVIDIA RTX 4060), cloud (NVIDIA T4), and enterprise (NVIDIA A100) GPUs. Our objective evaluation demonstrates that the system achieves real-time throughput ($τ< 1.0$) on modern hardware. A subjective user study further validates the approach, showing that a predictable, initial processing delay is highly acceptable to users in exchange for a smooth, uninterrupted playback experience.

        "summary": "Progress on training and architecture strategies has enabled LLMs with millions of tokens in context length. However, empirical evidence suggests that such long-context LLMs can consume far more text than they can reliably use. On the other hand, it has been shown that inference-time compute can be used to scale performance of LLMs, often by generating thinking tokens, on challenging tasks involving multi-step reasoning. Through controlled experiments on sandbox long-context tasks, we find that such inference-time strategies show rapidly diminishing returns and fail at long context. We attribute these failures to score dilution, a phenomenon inherent to static self-attention. Further, we show that current inference-time strategies cannot retrieve relevant long-context signals under certain conditions. We propose a simple method that, through targeted gradient updates on the given context, provably overcomes limitations of static self-attention. We find that this shift in how inference-time compute is spent leads to consistently large performance improvements across models and long-context benchmarks. Our method leads to large 12.6 and 14.1 percentage point improvements for Qwen3-4B on average across subsets of LongBench-v2 and ZeroScrolls benchmarks. The takeaway is practical: for long context, a small amount of context-specific training is a better use of inference compute than current inference-time scaling strategies like producing more thinking tokens.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evolve programs and multi-agent systems, yet most existing approaches rely on overwrite-based mutations that maintain only a single candidate at a time. Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.",

Math-only training improves mathematical accuracy from 3.1\\% to 12.0\\% but causes NLI accuracy to collapse from 81.0\\% to 16.5\\%--a 64.5 percentage point drop occurring within the first 1,000 training steps. We propose mixed training strategies that interleave mathematical and NLI examples during training. Our results demonstrate that mixed training completely eliminates catastrophic forgetting while maintaining equivalent mathematical performance: the balanced 1:1 ratio achieves 12.0\\% math accuracy (matching math-only) while preserving 86.2\\% NLI accuracy. We systematically explore mixing ratios from 1:1 to 15:1, finding that even minimal NLI exposure (6.2\\%) provides effective regularization.

Information theory gives a very simple way to estimate that time. For example, Shakespeare's phrase, Better three hours too soon than a minute too late, from The Merry Wives of Windsor, would take the educated monkey only 73 thousand years to produce, compared to the beyond-astronomical $2.7 \\times 10^{63}$ years for the randomly typing one.

        "summary": "Graph Transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising graph learning tool, leveraging their all-pair connected property to effectively capture global information. To address the over-smoothing problem in deep GNNs, global attention was initially introduced, eliminating the necessity for using deep GNNs. However, through empirical and theoretical analysis, we verify that the introduced global attention exhibits severe over-smoothing, causing node representations to become indistinguishable due to its inherent low-pass filtering. This effect is even stronger than that observed in GNNs. To mitigate this, we propose PageRank Transformer (ParaFormer), which features a PageRank-enhanced attention module designed to mimic the behavior of deep Transformers. We theoretically and empirically demonstrate that ParaFormer mitigates over-smoothing by functioning as an adaptive-pass filter. Experiments show that ParaFormer achieves consistent performance improvements across both node classification and graph classification tasks on 11 datasets ranging from thousands to millions of nodes, validating its efficacy.

        "summary": "Many practical decision-making problems involve tasks whose success depends on the entire system history, rather than on achieving a state with desired properties. Markovian Reinforcement Learning (RL) approaches are not suitable for such tasks, while RL with non-Markovian reward decision processes (NMRDPs) enables agents to tackle temporal-dependency tasks. This approach has long been known to lack formal guarantees on both (near-)optimality and sample efficiency. We contribute to solving both issues with QR-MAX, a novel model-based algorithm for discrete NMRDPs that factorizes Markovian transition learning from non-Markovian reward handling via reward machines. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model-based RL algorithm for discrete-action NMRDPs that exploits this factorization to obtain PAC convergence to $\\varepsilon$-optimal policies with polynomial sample complexity. We then extend QR-MAX to continuous state spaces with Bucket-QR-MAX, a SimHash-based discretiser that preserves the same factorized structure and achieves fast and stable learning without manual gridding or function approximation. We experimentally compare our method with modern state-of-the-art model-based RL approaches on environments of increasing complexity, showing a significant improvement in sample efficiency and increased robustness in finding optimal policies.",

We also prove that OW-HNPV is mathematically stable. It behaves in a controlled, predictable way, even when comparing persistence diagrams from networks with different feature types. Applied to Ethereum transaction networks (May 2017-May 2018), OW-HNPV demonstrates superior performance for cryptocurrency anomaly detection, achieving up to 10.4% AUC gain over baseline models for 7-day price movement predictions. Compared with established methods, including Vector of Averaged Bettis (VAB), persistence landscapes, and persistence images, velocity-based summaries excel at medium- to long-range forecasting (4-7 days), with OW-HNPV providing the most consistent and stable performance across prediction horizons.

To address this challenge, we introduce Geo-DeepONet, a geometry-aware deep operator network that incorporates domain information extracted from finite element discretizations. Geo-DeepONet enables accurate operator learning across arbitrary unstructured meshes without requiring retraining. Building on this, we develop a class of geometry-aware hybrid preconditioned iterative solvers by coupling Geo-DeepONet with traditional methods such as relaxation schemes and Krylov subspace algorithms. Through numerical experiments on parametric PDEs posed over diverse unstructured domains, we demonstrate the enhanced robustness and efficiency of the proposed hybrid solvers for multiple real-world applications.",

Traditional diagnostic approaches rely on handcrafted features and clinician expertise, while machine learning methods improve reproducibility but often struggle to generalize across noisy and heterogeneous clinical data. In this work, we propose Residual GRU with Multi-Head Self-Attention, a compact deep learning architecture designed for tabular clinical records. The model integrates residual bidirectional gated recurrent units for sequential modeling of feature columns, a channel reweighting block, and multi-head self-attention pooling with a learnable classification token to capture global context. We evaluate the model on the UCI Heart Disease dataset using 5-fold stratified cross-validation and compare it against classical methods such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machines, as well as modern deep learning baselines including DeepMLP, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and Transformers. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 0.861, macro-F1 of 0.860, ROC-AUC of 0.908, and PR-AUC of 0.904, outperforming all baselines. Ablation studies confirm the individual contributions of residual recurrence, channel gating, and attention pooling. t-SNE visualizations further indicate that the learned embeddings exhibit clearer separation between disease and non-disease classes compared to raw features. These results demonstrate that lightweight hybrid recurrent and attention-based architectures provide a strong balance between accuracy and efficiency for clinical risk prediction, supporting deployment in resource-constrained healthcare settings.",

However, current counterfactual techniques for time series classification are predominantly designed with static data assumptions and focus on generating minimal input perturbations to flip model predictions. This paper argues that such approaches are fundamentally insufficient in clinical recommendation settings, where interventions unfold over time and must be causally plausible and temporally coherent. We advocate for a shift towards counterfactuals that reflect sustained, goal-directed interventions aligned with clinical reasoning and patient-specific dynamics. We identify critical gaps in existing methods that limit their practical applicability, specifically, temporal blind spots and the lack of user-centered considerations in both method design and evaluation metrics. To support our position, we conduct a robustness analysis of several state-of-the-art methods for time series and show that the generated counterfactuals are highly sensitive to stochastic noise. This finding highlights their limited reliability in real-world clinical settings, where minor measurement variations are inevitable. We conclude by calling for methods and evaluation frameworks that go beyond mere prediction changes without considering feasibility or actionability. We emphasize the need for actionable, purpose-driven interventions that are feasible in real-world contexts for the users of such applications.",

Noninvasive electrocardiographic imaging (ECGI) combined with deep learning (DL) approaches for estimating intracardiac electrograms (EGMs) from body surface potentials (BSPMs) has shown promise, but progress is hindered by the limited availability of paired BSPM-EGM datasets. To address this limitation, we investigate variational autoencoders (VAEs) for the generation of synthetic multichannel atrial EGMs. Two models are proposed: a sinus rhythm-specific VAE (VAE-S) and a class-conditioned VAE (VAE-C) trained on both sinus rhythm and AF signals. Generated EGMs are evaluated using morphological, spectral, and distributional similarity metrics. VAE-S achieves higher fidelity with respect to in silico EGMs, while VAE-C enables rhythm-specific generation at the expense of reduced sinus reconstruction quality. As a proof of concept, the generated EGMs are used for data augmentation in a downstream noninvasive EGM reconstruction task, where moderate augmentation improves estimation performance. These results demonstrate the potential of VAE-based generative modeling to alleviate data scarcity and enhance deep learning-based ECGI pipelines.",

In this study, we analyze and compare various augmentation strategies, including traditional oversampling methods and generative techniques. Additionally, we adjust the class imbalance ratios in training datasets to evaluate their impact on model performance.

The framework comprises three complementary models: (i) a standalone Mamba model that predicts the time evolution of thermochemical state variables from given initial conditions; (ii) a constrained Mamba model that enforces mass conservation while learning the state dynamics; and (iii) a regime-informed architecture employing two standalone Mamba models to capture dynamics across temperature-dependent regimes. We additionally develop a latent Kinetic-Mamba variant that evolves dynamics in a reduced latent space and reconstructs the full state on the physical manifold. We evaluate the accuracy and robustness of Kinetic-Mamba using both time-decomposition and recursive-prediction strategies. We further assess the extrapolation capabilities of the model on varied out-of-distribution datasets.

Across centers, polysomnography (PSG) recordings are traditionally scored in 30-s epochs for pragmatic, not physiological, reasons and can vary considerably in electrode count, montage, and subject characteristics. These constraints present challenges in conducting harmonized multi-center sleep studies and discovering novel, robust biomarkers on shorter timescales. Here, we present AnySleep, a deep neural network model that uses any electroencephalography (EEG) or electrooculography (EOG) data to score sleep at adjustable temporal resolutions. We trained and validated the model on over 19,000 overnight recordings from 21 datasets collected across multiple clinics, spanning nearly 200,000 hours of EEG and EOG data, to promote robust generalization across sites. The model attains state-of-the-art performance and surpasses or equals established baselines at 30-s epochs. Performance improves as more channels are provided, yet remains strong when EOG is absent or when only EOG or single EEG derivations (frontal, central, or occipital) are available. On sub-30-s timescales, the model captures short wake intrusions consistent with arousals and improves prediction of physiological characteristics (age, sex) and pathophysiological conditions (sleep apnea), relative to standard 30-s scoring. We make the model publicly available to facilitate large-scale studies with heterogeneous electrode setups and to accelerate the discovery of novel biomarkers in sleep.",

Specifically, GRAFT strictly aligns daily-aggregated news, social media, and policy texts with half-hour load, and realizes text-guided fusion to specific time positions via cross-attention during both training and rolling forecasting. In addition, GRAFT provides a plug-and-play external-memory interface to accommodate different information sources in real-world deployment.

Experimental results show that GRAFT significantly outperforms strong baselines and reaches or surpasses the state of the art across multiple regions and forecasting horizons. Moreover, the model is robust in event-driven scenarios and enables temporal localization and source-level interpretation of text-to-load effects through attention read-out.

In contrast to state-of-the-art causal discovery methods that model the problem using discrete-time Dynamic Bayesian networks, our formulation is grounded in Difference-based causal models, which allow milder assumptions for modeling the continuous nature of the system. CaDyT leverages exact Gaussian Process inference for modeling the continuous-time dynamics which is more aligned with the underlying dynamical process.

        "summary": "Many learning problems involve symmetries, and while invariance can be built into neural architectures, it can also emerge implicitly when training on group-structured data. We study this phenomenon in classical Hopfield networks and show they can infer the full isomorphism class of a graph from a small random sample. Our results reveal that: (i) graph isomorphism classes can be represented within a three-dimensional invariant subspace, (ii) using gradient descent to minimize energy flow (MEF) has an implicit bias toward norm-efficient solutions, which underpins a polynomial sample complexity bound for learning isomorphism classes, and (iii) across multiple learning rules, parameters converge toward the invariant subspace as sample sizes grow. Together, these findings highlight a unifying mechanism for generalization in Hopfield networks: a bias toward norm efficiency in learning drives the emergence of approximate invariance under group-structured data.",

        "summary": "Graph generation is a crucial task in many fields, including network science and bioinformatics, as it enables the creation of synthetic graphs that mimic the properties of real-world networks for various applications. Graph Generative Models (GGMs) have emerged as a promising solution to this problem, leveraging deep learning techniques to learn the underlying distribution of real-world graphs and generate new samples that closely resemble them. Examples include approaches based on Variational Auto-Encoders, Recurrent Neural Networks, and more recently, diffusion-based models. However, the main limitation often lies in the evaluation process, which typically relies on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as a metric to assess the distribution of graph properties in the generated ensemble. This paper introduces a novel methodology for evaluating GGMs that overcomes the limitations of MMD, which we call RGM (Representation-aware Graph-generation Model evaluation). As a practical demonstration of our methodology, we present a comprehensive evaluation of two state-of-the-art Graph Generative Models: Graph Recurrent Attention Networks (GRAN) and Efficient and Degree-guided graph GEnerative model (EDGE). We investigate their performance in generating realistic graphs and compare them using a Geometric Deep Learning model trained on a custom dataset of synthetic and real-world graphs, specifically designed for graph classification tasks. Our findings reveal that while both models can generate graphs with certain topological properties, they exhibit significant limitations in preserving the structural characteristics that distinguish different graph domains. We also highlight the inadequacy of Maximum Mean Discrepancy as an evaluation metric for GGMs and suggest alternative approaches for future research.",

Building on a regularization-based framework for structured model learning, we focus on learning parameterized reaction terms and investigate how to incorporate key physical properties, such as mass conservation and quasipositivity, directly into the learning process. Our main contributions are twofold: First, we propose techniques to systematically modify a given class of parameterized reaction terms such that the resulting terms inherently satisfy mass conservation and quasipositivity, ensuring that the learned RD systems preserve non-negativity and adhere to physical principles. These modifications also guarantee well-posedness of the resulting PDEs under additional regularity and growth conditions. Second, we extend existing theoretical results on regularization-based model learning to RD systems using these physically consistent reaction terms. Specifically, we prove that solutions to the learning problem converge to a unique, regularization-minimizing solution of a limit system even when conservation laws and quasipositivity are enforced. In addition, we provide approximation results for quasipositive functions, essential for constructing physically consistent parameterizations. These results advance the development of interpretable and reliable data-driven models for RD systems that align with fundamental physical laws.",

To explain the empirical success of teacher-based filtering, we characterize the performance of filtered contrastive learning under the standard bimodal data generation model. Denoting $η\\in(0,1]$ as the fraction of data with correctly matched modalities among $n$ paired samples, we utilize a linear contrastive learning setup to show a provable benefit of data filtering: $(i)$ the error without filtering is upper and lower bounded by $\\frac{1}{η\\sqrt{n}}$, and $(ii)$ the error with teacher-based filtering is upper bounded by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{ηn}}$ in the large $η$ regime, and by $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}$ in the small $η$ regime.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in the finetuning of large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved their performance on established benchmarks, emphasizing the need for increasingly difficult, synthetic data. A key step in this data generation pipeline is a method for estimating problem difficulty. Current approaches, such as human calibration or performance-based scoring, fail to generalize to out-of-distribution problems, i.e. problems currently unsolvable by humans and LLMs, because they are not scalable, time-consuming, and ground truth dependent. Therefore, we propose a new method for estimating problem difficulty, LLM compare, that addresses these limitations. An LLM performs pairwise difficulty comparisons, and then Bradley-Terry scores are computed based on the outcomes. To validate our method, we first propose a conceptual framework that positions existing approaches on three orthogonal planes--construction, scale and dependence--identifying which quadrants a measure needs to occupy to score out-of-distribution problems. LLM compare naturally occupies all desirable quadrants as the first measure that is continuous and dynamic, model-agnostic and independent of ground truth information. As a second validation, we show that LLM compare demonstrates strong alignment with human annotations: Pearson $r \\geq 0.80$ for $n=1876$. Thirdly, we show that LLM compare is robust to hallucinations, with less than $6\\%$ degradation in Pearson correlation for $10\\%$ noise injection. Our work represents a significant step towards replacing time-consuming human annotations and synthetic data generation, and will be an important driver for curriculum design, model evaluation, and AI-assisted research ideation.",

Hyperbolic feature spaces are well-suited for this purpose, as they naturally capture hierarchical and relational structure often present in complex RL environments. However, leveraging these spaces commonly faces optimization challenges due to the nonstationarity of RL. In this work, we identify key factors that determine the success and failure of training hyperbolic deep RL agents. By analyzing the gradients of core operations in the Poincaré Ball and Hyperboloid models of hyperbolic geometry, we show that large-norm embeddings destabilize gradient-based training, leading to trust-region violations in proximal policy optimization (PPO). Based on these insights, we introduce Hyper++, a new hyperbolic PPO agent that consists of three components: (i) stable critic training through a categorical value loss instead of regression; (ii) feature regularization guaranteeing bounded norms while avoiding the curse of dimensionality from clipping; and (iii) using a more optimization-friendly formulation of hyperbolic network layers. In experiments on ProcGen, we show that Hyper++ guarantees stable learning, outperforms prior hyperbolic agents, and reduces wall-clock time by approximately 30%. On Atari-5 with Double DQN, Hyper++ strongly outperforms Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines. We release our code at https://github.com/Probabilistic-and-Interactive-ML/hyper-rl .",

In this paper, we first reveal that PGD is actually a specific reformulation of the projected gradient method using only the current gradient to determine its step-size. Further, we show that when we utilize a conventional adaptive matrix with the accumulated gradients to scale the perturbation, PGD becomes AdaGrad. Motivated by this analysis, we present a novel momentum-based attack AdaMI, in which the perturbation is optimized with an interesting momentum-based adaptive matrix. AdaMI is proved to attain optimal convergence for convex problems, indicating that it addresses the non-convergence issue of MI-FGSM, thereby ensuring stability of the optimization process. The experiments demonstrate that the proposed momentum-based adaptive matrix can serve as a general and effective technique to boost adversarial transferability over the state-of-the-art methods across different networks while maintaining better stability and imperceptibility.",

However, current deep learning-based RPP methods lack proactive environmental modeling, struggle with realistic multi-transmitter scenarios, and generalize poorly under distribution shifts, particularly when training/testing environments differ in building density or transmitter configurations. This paper identifies three key issues: (1) passive environmental modeling that overlooks transmitters and key environmental features; (2) overemphasis on single-transmitter scenarios despite real-world multi-transmitter prevalence; (3) excessive focus on in-distribution performance while neglecting distribution shift challenges. To address these, we propose PathFinder, a novel architecture that actively models buildings and transmitters via disentangled feature encoding and integrates Mask-Guided Low-rank Attention to independently focus on receiver and building regions. We also introduce a Transmitter-Oriented Mixup strategy for robust training and a new benchmark, single-to-multi-transmitter RPP (S2MT-RPP), tailored to evaluate extrapolation performance (multi-transmitter testing after single-transmitter training).

Existing approaches such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) rely heavily on reward models to guide LLMs toward human-aligned behaviors. In this work, we propose a logic-similarity-based reward mechanism as an alternative to conventional reward modeling. Instead of relying on heuristic reward estimation, our method leverages formal logical consistency to steer model alignment with human preferences.

S-GRPO incorporates an additional supervised component and jointly optimizes the generation term, KL-divergence regularization, and label-based objective during training. Experimental results demonstrate that S-GRPO consistently outperforms standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) in both performance and robustness.

As a result, a DIFNO can closely emulate not only the high-fidelity operator's response but also its sensitivities. To motivate the use of DIFNOs instead of conventional FNOs as surrogate models, we show that accurate surrogate-driven PDE-constrained optimization requires accurate surrogate Fréchet derivatives. Then, for continuously differentiable operators, we establish (i) simultaneous universal approximation of FNOs and their Fréchet derivatives on compact sets, and (ii) universal approximation of FNOs in weighted Sobolev spaces with input measures that have unbounded supports. Our theoretical results certify the capability of FNOs for accurate derivative-informed operator learning and accurate solution of PDE-constrained optimization. Furthermore, we develop efficient training schemes using dimension reduction and multi-resolution techniques that significantly reduce memory and computational costs for Fréchet derivative learning.

Recent MoE models demonstrate a clear trend towards high expert granularity (smaller expert intermediate dimension) and higher sparsity (constant number of activated experts with higher number of total experts), which improve model quality per FLOP. However, fine-grained MoEs suffer from increased activation memory footprint and reduced hardware efficiency due to higher IO costs, while sparser MoEs suffer from wasted computations due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. In response, we propose a memory-efficient algorithm to compute the forward and backward passes of MoEs with minimal activation caching for the backward pass. We also design GPU kernels that overlap memory IO with computation benefiting all MoE architectures. Finally, we propose a novel \"token rounding\" method that minimizes the wasted compute due to padding in Grouped GEMM kernels. As a result, our method SonicMoE reduces activation memory by 45% and achieves a 1.86x compute throughput improvement on Hopper GPUs compared to ScatterMoE's BF16 MoE kernel for a fine-grained 7B MoE. Concretely, SonicMoE on 64 H100s achieves a training throughput of 213 billion tokens per day comparable to ScatterMoE's 225 billion tokens per day on 96 H100s for a 7B MoE model training with FSDP-2 using the lm-engine codebase. Under high MoE sparsity settings, our tile-aware token rounding algorithm yields an additional 1.16x speedup on kernel execution time compared to vanilla top-$K$ routing while maintaining similar downstream performance. We open-source all our kernels to enable faster MoE model training.",

        "summary": "Time series analysis plays a vital role in fields such as finance, healthcare, industry, and meteorology, underpinning key tasks including classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection. Although deep learning models have achieved remarkable progress in these areas in recent years, constructing an efficient, multi-task compatible, and generalizable unified framework for time series analysis remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches are often tailored to single tasks or specific data types, making it difficult to simultaneously handle multi-task modeling and effectively integrate information across diverse time series types. Moreover, real-world data are often affected by noise, complex frequency components, and multi-scale dynamic patterns, which further complicate robust feature extraction and analysis. To ameliorate these challenges, we propose FusAD, a unified analysis framework designed for diverse time series tasks. FusAD features an adaptive time-frequency fusion mechanism, integrating both Fourier and Wavelet transforms to efficiently capture global-local and multi-scale dynamic features. With an adaptive denoising mechanism, FusAD automatically senses and filters various types of noise, highlighting crucial sequence variations and enabling robust feature extraction in complex environments. In addition, the framework integrates a general information fusion and decoding structure, combined with masked pre-training, to promote efficient learning and transfer of multi-granularity representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FusAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models on mainstream time series benchmarks for classification, forecasting, and anomaly detection tasks, while maintaining high efficiency and scalability.

Existing approaches typically model MTS data in either Euclidean or Riemannian space, limiting their ability to capture the diverse geometric structures and complex spatio-temporal dependencies inherent in real-world data. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Hybrid Symmetric Positive-Definite Manifold Graph Neural Network (HSMGNN), a novel graph neural network-based model that captures data geometry within a hybrid Euclidean-Riemannian framework. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage hybrid geometric representations for MTS forecasting, enabling expressive and comprehensive modeling of geometric properties. Specifically, we introduce a Submanifold-Cross-Segment (SCS) embedding to project input MTS into both Euclidean and Riemannian spaces, thereby capturing spatio-temporal variations across distinct geometric domains. To alleviate the high computational cost of Riemannian distance, we further design an Adaptive-Distance-Bank (ADB) layer with a trainable memory mechanism. Finally, a Fusion Graph Convolutional Network (FGCN) is devised to integrate features from the dual spaces via a learnable fusion operator for accurate prediction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that HSMGNN achieves up to a 13.8 percent improvement over state-of-the-art baselines in forecasting accuracy.",

To capture this broader biological landscape, we present EXAONE Path 2.5, a pathology foundation model that jointly models histologic, genomic, epigenetic and transcriptomic modalities, producing an integrated patient representation that reflects tumor biology more comprehensively. Our approach incorporates three key components: (1) multimodal SigLIP loss enabling all-pairwise contrastive learning across heterogeneous modalities, (2) a fragment-aware rotary positional encoding (F-RoPE) module that preserves spatial structure and tissue-fragment topology in WSI, and (3) domain-specialized internal foundation models for both WSI and RNA-seq to provide biologically grounded embeddings for robust multimodal alignment. We evaluate EXAONE Path 2.5 against six leading pathology foundation models across two complementary benchmarks: an internal real-world clinical dataset and the Patho-Bench benchmark covering 80 tasks. Our framework demonstrates high data and parameter efficiency, achieving on-par performance with state-of-the-art foundation models on Patho-Bench while exhibiting the highest adaptability in the internal clinical setting.

However, compared to the more widely studied MHC-I in computational immunotherapy, the study of MHC-II antigenic epitope poses significantly more challenges due to its complex binding specificity and ambiguous motif patterns. Consequently, existing datasets for MHC-II interactions are smaller and less standardized than those available for MHC-I. To address these challenges, we present a well-curated dataset derived from the Immune Epitope Database (IEDB) and other public sources. It not only extends and standardizes existing peptide-MHC-II datasets, but also introduces a novel antigen-MHC-II dataset with richer biological context. Leveraging this dataset, we formulate three major machine learning (ML) tasks of peptide binding, peptide presentation, and antigen presentation, which progressively capture the broader biological processes within the MHC-II antigen presentation pathway. We further employ a multi-scale evaluation framework to benchmark existing models, along with a comprehensive analysis over various modeling designs to this problem with a modular framework. Overall, this work serves as a valuable resource for advancing computational immunotherapy, providing a foundation for future research in ML guided epitope discovery and predictive modeling of immune responses.",

However, achieving exact invariance to specific symmetries typically requires designing bespoke architectures for each group of symmetries, limiting scalability and preventing knowledge transfer across related symmetries. In the case of the space groups, symmetries critical to modeling crystalline solids in materials science and condensed matter physics, this challenge is particularly salient as there are 230 such groups in three dimensions. In this work we present a new approach to such crystallographic symmetries by developing a single machine learning architecture that is capable of adapting its weights automatically to enforce invariance to any input space group. Our approach is based on constructing symmetry-adapted Fourier bases through an explicit characterization of constraints that group operations impose on Fourier coefficients. Encoding these constraints into a neural network layer enables weight sharing across different space groups, allowing the model to leverage structural similarities between groups and overcome data sparsity when limited measurements are available for specific groups. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in achieving competitive performance on material property prediction tasks and performing zero-shot learning to generalize to unseen groups.",

We present Pattern-Guided Diffusion Models (PGDM), which leverage inherent patterns within temporal data for forecasting future time steps. PGDM first extracts patterns using archetypal analysis and estimates the most likely next pattern in the sequence. By guiding predictions with this pattern estimate, PGDM makes more realistic predictions that fit within the set of known patterns. We additionally introduce a novel uncertainty quantification technique based on archetypal analysis, and we dynamically scale the guidance level based on the pattern estimate uncertainty. We apply our method to two well-motivated forecasting applications, predicting visual field measurements and motion capture frames. On both, we show that pattern guidance improves PGDM's performance (MAE / CRPS) by up to 40.67% / 56.26% and 14.12% / 14.10%, respectively.

Typically, BO iteratively updates a probabilistic surrogate model of this mapping and optimizes acquisition functions derived from the model to guide molecule selection. However, its performance is limited in low-data regimes with insufficient prior knowledge and vast candidate spaces. Large language models (LLMs) and chemistry foundation models offer rich priors to enhance BO, but high-dimensional features, costly in-context learning, and the computational burden of deep Bayesian surrogates hinder their full utilization. To address these challenges, we propose a likelihood-free BO method that bypasses explicit surrogate modeling and directly leverages priors from general LLMs and chemistry-specific foundation models to inform acquisition functions. Our method also learns a tree-structured partition of the molecular search space with local acquisition functions, enabling efficient candidate selection via Monte Carlo Tree Search. By further incorporating coarse-grained LLM-based clustering, it substantially improves scalability to large candidate sets by restricting acquisition function evaluations to clusters with statistically higher property values. We show through extensive experiments and ablations that the proposed method substantially improves scalability, robustness, and sample efficiency in LLM-guided BO for molecular discovery.",

        "summary": "Out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body systems exhibit rapid correlation buildup that underlies many emerging phenomena. Exact wave-function methods to describe this scale exponentially with particle number; simpler mean-field approaches neglect essential two-particle correlations. The time-dependent two-particle reduced density matrix (TD2RDM) formalism offers a middle ground by propagating the two-particle reduced density matrix (2RDM) and closing the BBGKY hierarchy with a reconstruction of the three-particle cumulant. But the validity and existence of time-local reconstruction functionals ignoring memory effects remain unclear across different dynamical regimes. We show that a neural ODE model trained on exact 2RDM data (no dimensionality reduction) can reproduce its dynamics without any explicit three-particle information -- but only in parameter regions where the Pearson correlation between the two- and three-particle cumulants is large. In the anti-correlated or uncorrelated regime, the neural ODE fails, indicating that no simple time-local functional of the instantaneous two-particle cumulant can capture the evolution. The magnitude of the time-averaged three-particle-correlation buildup appears to be the primary predictor of success: For a moderate correlation buildup, both neural ODE predictions and existing TD2RDM reconstructions are accurate, whereas stronger values lead to systematic breakdowns. These findings pinpoint the need for memory-dependent kernels in the three-particle cumulant reconstruction for the latter regime. Our results place the neural ODE as a model-agnostic diagnostic tool that maps the regime of applicability of cumulant expansion methods and guides the development of non-local closure schemes. More broadly, the ability to learn high-dimensional RDM dynamics from limited data opens a pathway to fast, data-driven simulation of correlated quantum matter.",

Accurate precipitation forecasts are vital for society. Reliable predictions help communities mitigate climatic impacts. Based on the current relevance of artificial intelligence (AI), classical machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) techniques have been used as an alternative or complement to dynamic modeling. However, there is still a lack of broad investigations into the feasibility of purely data-driven approaches for precipitation forecasting. This study aims at addressing this issue where different classical ML and DL approaches for forecasting precipitation in South America, taking into account all 2019 seasons, are considered in a detailed investigation. The selected classical ML techniques were Random Forests and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), while the DL counterparts were a 1D convolutional neural network (CNN 1D), a long short-term memory (LSTM) model, and a gated recurrent unit (GRU) model. Additionally, the Brazilian Global Atmospheric Model (BAM) was used as a representative of the traditional dynamic modeling approach. We also relied on explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to provide some explanations for the models behaviors. LSTM showed strong predictive performance while BAM, the traditional dynamic model representative, had the worst results. Despite presented the higher latency, LSTM was most accurate for heavy precipitation. If cost is a concern, XGBoost offers lower latency with slightly accuracy loss. The results of this research confirm the viability of DL models for climate forecasting, solidifying a global trend in major meteorological and climate forecasting centers.",

One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory.

All our results are non-asymptotic and distribution-free. We conclude by providing advice on how to measure calibration error in practice. Our methods yield practical procedures that can be run on real-world datasets with modest overhead.",

Dropout methods are regularisation techniques for training NNs, first introduced by G. Hinton et al. (2012). These methods temporarily remove connections in the NN, randomly at each stage of training, and update the remaining subnetwork with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). The process of removing connections from a network at random is similar to percolation, a paradigm model of statistical physics. If dropout were to remove enough connections such that there is no path between the input and output of the NN, then the NN could not make predictions informed by the data. We study new percolation models that mimic dropout in NNs and characterise the relationship between network topology and this path problem. The theory shows the existence of a percolative effect in dropout. We also show that this percolative effect can cause a breakdown when training NNs without biases with dropout; and we argue heuristically that this breakdown extends to NNs with biases.",

In this paper, we investigate whether this human improvement strategy can be applied to improving reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) for alignment of language models (LMs). In particular, it is observed in the literature that LMs tuned by RLHF can still output unsatisfactory responses. This paper proposes a method to improve the unsatisfactory responses by correcting their causes. Our method has two parts. The first part proposes a post-hoc explanation method to explain why an unsatisfactory response is generated to a prompt by identifying the training data that lead to this response. We formulate this problem as a constrained combinatorial optimization problem where the objective is to find a set of training data closest to this prompt-response pair in a feature representation space, and the constraint is that the prompt-response pair can be decomposed as a convex combination of this set of training data in the feature space. We propose an efficient iterative data selection algorithm to solve this problem. The second part proposes an unlearning method that improves unsatisfactory responses to some prompts by unlearning the training data that lead to these unsatisfactory responses and, meanwhile, does not significantly degrade satisfactory responses to other prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that our algorithm can improve RLHF.",

However, despite the convincing benchmark performance, successful translation to real applications is limited. The frequent disconnect between performance on controlled BCI benchmarks and its lack of generalisation to practical settings indicates hidden overfitting problems. We introduce Disentangled Decoding Decomposition (D3), a weakly supervised method for training deep learning models across EEG datasets. By predicting the place in the respective trial sequence from which the input window was sampled, EEG-D3 separates latent components of brain activity, akin to non-linear ICA. We utilise a novel model architecture with fully independent sub-networks for strict interpretability. We outline a feature interpretation paradigm to contrast the component activation profiles on different datasets and inspect the associated temporal and spatial filters. The proposed method reliably separates latent components of brain activity on motor imagery data. Training downstream classifiers on an appropriate subset of these components prevents hidden overfitting caused by task-correlated artefacts, which severely affects end-to-end classifiers. We further exploit the linearly separable latent space for effective few-shot learning on sleep stage classification. The ability to distinguish genuine components of brain activity from spurious features results in models that avoid the hidden overfitting problem and generalise well to real-world applications, while requiring only minimal labelled data. With interest to the neuroscience community, the proposed method gives researchers a tool to separate individual brain processes and potentially even uncover heretofore unknown dynamics.",

Our approach constructs a local safe region by combining trajectory rollouts with smoothness bounds that relate parameter changes to shifts in safety metrics. Each gradient update is then projected via a convex SOCP, producing a safe first-order step. We establish a safe-by-induction guarantee: starting from any safe initialization, all intermediate policies remain safe given feasible projections. In constrained control settings with a stabilizing backup policy, our approach further ensures closed-loop stability and enables safe adaptation beyond the conservative backup.

However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the complementary information across views, leading to suboptimal feature representations and limited performance. To address this, we propose MV-SupGCN, a semi-supervised GCN model that integrates several complementary components with clear motivations and mutual reinforcement. First, to better capture discriminative features and improve model generalization, we design a joint loss function that combines Cross-Entropy loss with Supervised Contrastive loss, encouraging the model to simultaneously minimize intra-class variance and maximize inter-class separability in the latent space. Second, recognizing the instability and incompleteness of single graph construction methods, we combine both KNN-based and semi-supervised graph construction approaches on each view, thereby enhancing the robustness of the data structure representation and reducing generalization error. Third, to effectively utilize abundant unlabeled data and enhance semantic alignment across multiple views, we propose a unified framework that integrates contrastive learning in order to enforce consistency among multi-view embeddings and capture meaningful inter-view relationships, together with pseudo-labeling, which provides additional supervision applied to both the cross-entropy and contrastive loss functions to enhance model generalization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MV-SupGCN consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, validating the effectiveness of our integrated approach.

Unlike traffic volume data, probe vehicle speeds and static road attributes are more broadly accessible and support full coverage of road segments in most urban networks. In this work, we present the Hybrid Directed-Attention Spatio-Temporal Graph Neural Network (HDA-STGNN), an inductive deep learning framework designed to tackle the network-wide volume estimation problem. Our approach leverages speed profiles, static road attributes, and road network topology to predict daily traffic volume profiles across all road segments in the network.

Depth Up-Scaling (DUS) has emerged as a promising strategy by duplicating layers and applying Continual Pre-training (CPT), but its reliance on feed-forward networks (FFNs) limits efficiency and attainable gains. We introduce Memory-Infused Depth Up-Scaling (MIDUS), which replaces FFNs in duplicated blocks with a head-wise memory (HML) layer. Motivated by observations that attention heads have distinct roles both across and within layers, MIDUS assigns an independent memory bank to each head, enabling head-wise retrieval and injecting information into subsequent layers while preserving head-wise functional structure. This design combines sparse memory access with head-wise representations and incorporates an efficient per-head value factorization module, thereby relaxing the usual efficiency-performance trade-off. Across our CPT experiments, MIDUS exhibits robust performance improvements over strong DUS baselines while maintaining a highly efficient parameter footprint. Our findings establish MIDUS as a compelling and resource-efficient alternative to conventional FFN replication for depth up-scaling by leveraging its head-wise memory design.",

Experimental results identify a substantial gap between validation and test performance, with models performing worse than trivial baselines despite strong validation metrics. The analysis demonstrates that pretrained embeddings yield diminishing returns below a critical data sufficiency threshold, and that small validation sets contribute to overfitting during model selection. Practical application is illustrated through weekly sentiment aggregation and narrative summarization for market monitoring workflows. The findings offer empirical evidence that embedding quality alone cannot address fundamental data scarcity in sentiment classification.

Current defense strategies often rely on computationally expensive external classifiers or brittle lexical filters, overlooking the intrinsic dynamics of the model's reasoning process. In this work, the Laminar Flow Hypothesis is introduced, which posits that benign inputs induce smooth, gradual transitions in an LLM's high-dimensional latent space, whereas adversarial prompts trigger chaotic, high-variance trajectories - termed Semantic Turbulence - resulting from the internal conflict between safety alignment and instruction-following objectives. This phenomenon is formalized through a novel, zero-shot metric: the variance of layer-wise cosine velocity. Experimental evaluation across diverse small language models reveals a striking diagnostic capability. The RLHF-aligned Qwen2-1.5B exhibits a statistically significant 75.4% increase in turbulence under attack (p less than 0.001), validating the hypothesis of internal conflict. Conversely, Gemma-2B displays a 22.0% decrease in turbulence, characterizing a distinct, low-entropy \"reflex-based\" refusal mechanism. These findings demonstrate that Semantic Turbulence serves not only as a lightweight, real-time jailbreak detector but also as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for categorizing the underlying safety architecture of black-box models.",

        "summary": "In recent years, there has been a notable increase in the use of supervised detection methods of major depressive disorder (MDD) based on electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. However, the process of labeling MDD remains challenging. As a self-supervised learning method, contrastive learning could address the shortcomings of supervised learning methods, which are unduly reliant on labels in the context of MDD detection. However, existing contrastive learning methods are not specifically designed to characterize the time-frequency distribution of EEG signals, and their capacity to acquire low-semantic data representations is still inadequate for MDD detection tasks. To address the problem of contrastive learning method, we propose a time-frequency fusion and multi-domain cross-loss (TF-MCL) model for MDD detection. TF-MCL generates time-frequency hybrid representations through the use of a fusion mapping head (FMH), which efficiently remaps time-frequency domain information to the fusion domain, and thus can effectively enhance the model's capacity to synthesize time-frequency information. Moreover, by optimizing the multi-domain cross-loss function, the distribution of the representations in the time-frequency domain and the fusion domain is reconstructed, thereby improving the model's capacity to acquire fusion representations. We evaluated the performance of our model on the publicly available datasets MODMA and PRED+CT and show a significant improvement in accuracy, outperforming the existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) method by 5.87% and 9.96%, respectively.",

To address these limitations, we propose DARTs, a robust long short-term dual-path framework with window-aware spatiotemporal soft fusion mechanism, which can be primarily decomposed into three complementary components. Specifically, in the short-term path, we introduce a Multi-View Sparse Graph Learner and a Diffusion Multi-Relation Graph Unit that collaborate to adaptively capture hierarchical discriminative short-term spatiotemporal patterns in the high-noise time series. While in the long-term path, we design a Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Constructor to model salient long-term dynamics within the high-dimensional representation space. Finally, a window-aware spatiotemporal soft-fusion mechanism is introduced to filter the residual noise while seamlessly integrating anomalous patterns. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experimental results across mainstream datasets demonstrate the superiority and robustness of our proposed DARTs.

While existing studies mainly focus on improving the efficiency of FR models, they largely overlook the issue of embedding parameter overhead.

Despite these advancements, a persistent challenge remains--selecting the optimal ranks for each layer to jointly optimise compression rate and downstream task accuracy. Current methods either rely on heuristics that can yield sub-optimal results due to their limited discrete search space or are gradient-based but are not as performant as heuristic approaches without post-compression fine-tuning. To address these issues, we propose Learning to Low-Rank Compress (LLRC), a gradient-based approach which directly learns the weights of masks that select singular values in a fine-tuning-free setting. Using a calibration dataset, we train only the mask weights to select fewer and fewer singular values while minimising the divergence of intermediate activations from the original model. Our approach outperforms competing ranking selection methods that similarly require no post-compression fine-tuning across various compression rates on common-sense reasoning and open-domain question-answering tasks. For instance, with a compression rate of 20% on Llama-2-13B, LLRC outperforms the competitive Sensitivity-based Truncation Rank Searching (STRS) on MMLU, BoolQ, and OpenbookQA by 12%, 3.5%, and 4.4%, respectively. Compared to other compression techniques, our approach consistently outperforms fine-tuning-free variants of SVD-LLM and LLM-Pruner across datasets and compression rates.

Existing deep and operator-learning models collapse under these conditions: fixed-grid assumptions fail, reconstruction deteriorates sharply, and inversion becomes unreliable with limited robustness and no uncertainty quantification (UQ).We propose the Physical Inversion Solver (PIS), a set-conditioned diffusion framework enabling inversion from truly arbitrary observation sets. PIS employs a Set Transformer-based encoder to handle measurements of any number or geometry, and a cosine-annealed sparsity curriculum for exceptional robustness. An accompanying information-theoretic analysis provides insight into the limits of inversion under extreme sparsity by revealing how observation entropy varies across physical systems.PIS is evaluated on three challenging PDE inverse problems: Darcy flow, wavefield inversion (Helmholtz), and structural health monitoring (Hooke's Law). Across all tasks and sparsity regimes -- including extreme cases with an observation rate of only $0.29\\%$ -- existing operator-learning baselines fail to reconstruct meaningful fields, often diverging or collapsing entirely.In stark contrast, PIS remains stable and accurate, reducing inversion error by $12.28\\%$--$88.73\\%$ and reliably producing calibrated posterior samples. These samples accurately reflect both data scarcity and intrinsic physical ambiguity. These results position PIS as a powerful, general-purpose, and uniquely sparsity-resilient solution for physical inversion under arbitrary and severely undersampled observations.",

        "summary": "Various weather modelling problems (e.g., weather forecasting, optimizing turbine placements, etc.) require ample access to high-resolution, highly accurate wind data. Acquiring such high-resolution wind data, however, remains a challenging and expensive endeavour. Traditional reconstruction approaches are typically either cost-effective or accurate, but not both. Deep learning methods, including diffusion models, have been proposed to resolve this trade-off by leveraging advances in natural image super-resolution. Wind data, however, is distinct from natural images, and wind super-resolvers often use upwards of 10 input channels, significantly more than the usual 3-channel RGB inputs in natural images. To better leverage a large number of conditioning variables in diffusion models, we present a generalization of classifier-free guidance (CFG) to multiple conditioning inputs. Our novel composite classifier-free guidance (CCFG) can be dropped into any pre-trained diffusion model trained with standard CFG dropout. We demonstrate that CCFG outputs are higher-fidelity than those from CFG on wind super-resolution tasks. We present WindDM, a diffusion model trained for industrial-scale wind dynamics reconstruction and leveraging CCFG. WindDM achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality among deep learning models and costs up to $1000\\times$ less than classical methods.",

While recent methods like Dion reduce per-step communication through low-rank updates, they synchronize at every step regardless of the optimization landscape. We observe that synchronization requirements vary dramatically throughout training: workers naturally compute similar gradients in flat regions, making frequent synchronization redundant, while high-curvature regions require coordination to prevent divergence. We introduce CurvaDion, which uses Relative Maximum Momentum Change (RMMC) to detect high-curvature regions requiring synchronization. RMMC leverages momentum dynamics which are already computed during optimization as a computationally tractable proxy for directional curvature, adding only $\\mathcal{O}(d)$ operations per layer. We establish theoretical connections between RMMC and loss curvature and demonstrate that CurvaDion achieves 99\\% communication reduction while matching baseline convergence across models from 160M to 1.3B parameters.",

        "summary": "Ride-hailing platforms face the challenge of balancing passenger waiting times with overall system efficiency under highly uncertain supply-demand conditions. Adaptive delayed matching creates a trade-off between matching and pickup delays by deciding whether to assign drivers immediately or batch requests. Since outcomes accumulate over long horizons with stochastic dynamics, reinforcement learning (RL) is a suitable framework. However, existing approaches often oversimplify traffic dynamics or use shallow encoders that miss complex spatiotemporal patterns. We introduce the Regime-Aware Spatio-Temporal Mixture-of-Experts (RAST-MoE), which formalizes adaptive delayed matching as a regime-aware MDP equipped with a self-attention MoE encoder. Unlike monolithic networks, our experts specialize automatically, improving representation capacity while maintaining computational efficiency. A physics-informed congestion surrogate preserves realistic density-speed feedback, enabling millions of efficient rollouts, while an adaptive reward scheme guards against pathological strategies. With only 12M parameters, our framework outperforms strong baselines. On real-world Uber trajectory data (San Francisco), it improves total reward by over 13%, reducing average matching and pickup delays by 10% and 15% respectively. It demonstrates robustness across unseen demand regimes and stable training. These findings highlight the potential of MoE-enhanced RL for large-scale decision-making with complex spatiotemporal dynamics.",

Highly relevant items having higher evaluation costs may not fit within the user's time budget, affecting engagement. In this position paper, our objective is to evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms that learn patterns in user preferences and time budgets simultaneously, crafting recommendations with higher engagement potential under resource constraints. Our experiments explore the use of reinforcement learning to recommend items for users using Alibaba's Personalized Re-ranking dataset supporting slate optimization in e-commerce contexts. Our contributions include (i) a unified formulation of time-constrained slate recommendation modeled as Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) with budget-aware utilities; (ii) a simulation framework to study policy behavior on re-ranking data; and (iii) empirical evidence that on-policy and off-policy control can improve performance under tight time budgets than traditional contextual bandit-based methods.",

        "summary": "Many deep learning approaches have been developed for EEG-based seizure detection; however, most rely on access to large centralized annotated datasets. In clinical practice, EEG data are often scarce, patient-specific distributed across institutions, and governed by strict privacy regulations that prohibit data pooling. As a result, creating usable AI-based seizure detection models remains challenging in real-world medical settings. To address these constraints, we propose a two-stage federated few-shot learning (FFSL) framework for personalized EEG-based seizure detection. The method is trained and evaluated on the TUH Event Corpus, which includes six EEG event classes. In Stage 1, a pretrained biosignal transformer (BIOT) is fine-tuned across non-IID simulated hospital sites using federated learning, enabling shared representation learning without centralizing EEG recordings. In Stage 2, federated few-shot personalization adapts the classifier to each patient using only five labeled EEG segments, retaining seizure-specific information while still benefiting from cross-site knowledge. Federated fine-tuning achieved a balanced accuracy of 0.43 (centralized: 0.52), Cohen's kappa of 0.42 (0.49), and weighted F1 of 0.69 (0.74). In the FFSL stage, client-specific models reached an average balanced accuracy of 0.77, Cohen's kappa of 0.62, and weighted F1 of 0.73 across four sites with heterogeneous event distributions. These results suggest that FFSL can support effective patient-adaptive seizure detection under realistic data-availability and privacy constraints.",

This study developed a machine learning framework to predict RSV-associated hospitalizations in the United States (U.S.) by integrating wastewater surveillance, meteorological, and air quality data. The dataset combined weekly hospitalization rates, wastewater RSV levels, daily meteorological measurements, and air pollutant concentrations. Classification models, including CART, Random Forest, and Boosting, were trained to predict weekly RSV-associated hospitalization rates classified as \\textit{Low risk}, \\textit{Alert}, and \\textit{Epidemic} levels. The wastewater RSV level was identified as the strongest predictor, followed by meteorological and air quality variables such as temperature, ozone levels, and specific humidity. Notably, the analysis also revealed significantly higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates among Native Americans and Alaska Natives. Further research is needed to better understand the drivers of RSV disparity in these communities to improve prevention strategies. Furthermore, states at high altitudes, characterized by lower surface pressure, showed consistently higher RSV-associated hospitalization rates. These findings highlight the value of combining environmental and community surveillance data to forecast RSV outbreaks, enabling more timely public health interventions and resource allocation. In order to provide accessibility and practical use of the models, we have developed an interactive R Shiny dashboard (https://f6yxlu-eric-guo.shinyapps.io/rsv_app/), which allows users to explore RSV-associated hospitalization risk levels across different states, visualize the impact of key predictors, and interactively generate RSV outbreak forecasts.",

First, we perform a single influence-style update that subtracts the contribution of all training points from the target class by solving a Hessian-vector system with conjugate gradients, requiring only gradient and Hessian-vector products. Second, in contrast to common unlearning baselines that randomly reclassify deleted-class samples, we enforce a decision-space guarantee via Top-1 classification. On standard text benchmarks, Hessian Reassignment achieves retained-class accuracy close to full retrain-without-class while running orders of magnitude faster. Additionally, it consistently lowers membership-inference advantage on the removed class, measured with pooled multi-shadow attacks. These results demonstrate a practical, principled path to efficient class unlearning in document classification.",

This study combines Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with environmental and hydrological data to model flood susceptibility in the River Nyando watershed, western Kenya. Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR data from the May 2024 flood event were processed to produce a binary flood inventory, which served as training data for machine learning (ML) models. Six conditioning factors -- slope, elevation, aspect, land use/land cover, soil type, and distance from streams -- were integrated with the SAR-derived flood inventory to train four supervised classifiers: Logistic Regression (LR), Classification and Regression Trees (CART), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Random Forest (RF). Model performance was assessed using accuracy, Cohen's Kappa, and Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis. Results indicate that RF achieved the highest predictive performance (accuracy = 0.762; Kappa = 0.480), outperforming LR, CART, and SVM. The RF-based susceptibility map showed that low-lying Kano Plains near Lake Victoria have the highest flood vulnerability, consistent with historical flood records and the impacts of the May 2024 event. These findings demonstrate the value of combining SAR data and ensemble ML methods for flood susceptibility mapping in regions with limited data.

These complex textual data sets have immense potential to inform future policy and targeted recommendations. However, because SL text data lack dedicated methods and are noisy, heterogeneous, and prone to anomalies, detecting and inferring key patterns is challenging. We introduce LLmFPCA-detect, a flexible framework that pairs LLM-based text embeddings with functional data analysis to detect clusters and infer anomalies in large SL text datasets. First, LLmFPCA-detect embeds each piece of text into an application-specific numeric space using LLM prompts. Sparse multivariate functional principal component analysis (mFPCA) conducted in the numeric space forms the workhorse to recover primary population characteristics, and produces subject-level scores which, together with baseline static covariates, facilitate data segmentation, unsupervised anomaly detection and inference, and enable other downstream tasks. In particular, we leverage LLMs to perform dynamic keyword profiling guided by the data segments and anomalies discovered by LLmFPCA-detect, and we show that cluster-specific functional PC scores from LLmFPCA-detect, used as features in existing pipelines, help boost prediction performance. We support the stability of LLmFPCA-detect with experiments and evaluate it on two different applications using public datasets, Amazon customer-review trajectories, and Wikipedia talk-page comment streams, demonstrating utility across domains and outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.",

Due to the limited availability of richly annotated music datasets, much of the progress in AMT has been concentrated on classical piano music, and even a few very specific datasets. Whether these systems can generalize effectively to other musical contexts remains an open question. Complementing recent studies on distribution shifts in sound (e.g., recording conditions), in this work we investigate the musical dimension -- specifically, variations in genre, dynamics, and polyphony levels. To this end, we introduce the MDS corpus, comprising three distinct subsets -- (1) Genre, (2) Random, and (3) MAEtest -- to emulate different axes of distribution shift. We evaluate the performance of several state-of-the-art AMT systems on the MDS corpus using both traditional information-retrieval and musically-informed performance metrics. Our extensive evaluation isolates and exposes varying degrees of performance degradation under specific distribution shifts. In particular, we measure a note-level F1 performance drop of 20 percentage points due to sound, and 14 due to genre. Generally, we find that dynamics estimation proves more vulnerable to musical variation than onset prediction. Musically informed evaluation metrics, particularly those capturing harmonic structure, help identify potential contributing factors. Furthermore, experiments with randomly generated, non-musical sequences reveal clear limitations in system performance under extreme musical distribution shifts. Altogether, these findings offer new evidence of the persistent impact of the Corpus Bias problem in deep AMT systems.",

Random Forest analysis identified top predictors turned into temporal and statistical features, and Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was used to overcome the class imbalance issue.

This study presents a unified, unsupervised machine learning framework to detect and classify emerging trade anomalies within UN Comtrade data (2020 to 2024). Moving beyond traditional rule-based monitoring, we apply a four-layer analytical pipeline utilizing Forensic Statistics, Isolation Forests, Network Science, and Deep Autoencoders. Contrary to the hypothesis that Sustainability Arbitrage would be the primary driver, empirical results reveal a contradictory and more severe phenomenon of Hardware Masking. Illicit actors exploit bi-directional tariff incentives by misclassifying scrap as high-count heterogeneous goods to justify extreme unit-price outliers of >$160/kg, a 1,900% markup indicative of Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML) rather than commercial arbitrage. Topologically, risk is not concentrated in major exporters but in high-centrality Shadow Hubs that function as pivotal nodes for illicit rerouting. These actors execute a strategy of Void-Shoring, systematically suppressing destination data to Unspecified Code to fracture mirror statistics and sever forensic trails. Validated by SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations), the results confirm that price deviation is the dominant predictor of anomalies, necessitating a paradigm shift in customs enforcement from physical volume checks to dynamic, algorithmic valuation auditing.",

STLS is an algorithm to solve the $\\ell_0$ sparse least-squares problem, which relies on splitting to efficiently solve the least-squares portion while handling the sparse term via proximal methods. It produces coefficient vectors whose components depend on both the projected reconstruction errors, here referred to as the scores, and the mutual coherence of dictionary terms. The first contribution of this work is a theoretical analysis of the score and dictionary-selection strategy. This could be understood in both the original and weak SINDy regime. Second, numerical experiments on ordinary and partial differential equations highlight the effectiveness of score-based screening, improving both accuracy and interpretability in dynamical system identification. These results suggest that integrating score-guided methods to refine the dictionary more accurately may help SINDy users in some cases to enhance their robustness for data-driven discovery of governing equations.",

However, existing methods suffer from limited transferability in cross-model evaluations. To address this, we propose Transferable Defense Against Malicious Image Edits (TDAE), a novel bimodal framework that enhances image immunity against malicious edits through coordinated image-text optimization. Specifically, at the visual defense level, we introduce FlatGrad Defense Mechanism (FDM), which incorporates gradient regularization into the adversarial objective. By explicitly steering the perturbations toward flat minima, FDM amplifies immune robustness against unseen editing models. For textual enhancement protection, we propose an adversarial optimization paradigm named Dynamic Prompt Defense (DPD), which periodically refines text embeddings to align the editing outcomes of immunized images with those of the original images, then updates the images under optimized embeddings. Through iterative adversarial updates to diverse embeddings, DPD enforces the generation of immunized images that seek a broader set of immunity-enhancing features, thereby achieving cross-model transferability. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our TDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance in mitigating malicious edits under both intra- and cross-model evaluations.",

While current defenses seek to mitigate this risk by embedding imperceptible perturbations, their effectiveness is limited against malicious tampering. To address this issue, we propose a Dual Attention-Guided Noise Perturbation (DANP) immunization method that adds imperceptible perturbations to disrupt the model's semantic understanding and generation process. DANP functions over multiple timesteps to manipulate both cross-attention maps and the noise prediction process, using a dynamic threshold to generate masks that identify text-relevant and irrelevant regions. It then reduces attention in relevant areas while increasing it in irrelevant ones, thereby misguides the edit towards incorrect regions and preserves the intended targets. Additionally, our method maximizes the discrepancy between the injected noise and the model's predicted noise to further interfere with the generation. By targeting both attention and noise prediction mechanisms, DANP exhibits impressive immunity against malicious edits, and extensive experiments confirm that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

        "summary": "Text-guided image editing via diffusion models, while powerful, raises significant concerns about misuse, motivating efforts to immunize images against unauthorized edits using imperceptible perturbations. Prevailing metrics for evaluating immunization success typically rely on measuring the visual dissimilarity between the output generated from a protected image and a reference output generated from the unprotected original. This approach fundamentally overlooks the core requirement of image immunization, which is to disrupt semantic alignment with attacker intent, regardless of deviation from any specific output. We argue that immunization success should instead be defined by the edited output either semantically mismatching the prompt or suffering substantial perceptual degradations, both of which thwart malicious intent. To operationalize this principle, we propose Synergistic Intermediate Feature Manipulation (SIFM), a method that strategically perturbs intermediate diffusion features through dual synergistic objectives: (1) maximizing feature divergence from the original edit trajectory to disrupt semantic alignment with the expected edit, and (2) minimizing feature norms to induce perceptual degradations. Furthermore, we introduce the Immunization Success Rate (ISR), a novel metric designed to rigorously quantify true immunization efficacy for the first time. ISR quantifies the proportion of edits where immunization induces either semantic failure relative to the prompt or significant perceptual degradations, assessed via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Extensive experiments show our SIFM achieves the state-of-the-art performance for safeguarding visual content against malicious diffusion-based manipulation.",

However, ABI methods are highly sensitive to model misspecification: when observed data fall outside the training distribution (generative scope of the statistical models), neural surrogates can behave unpredictably. This makes it a challenge in a model comparison setting, where multiple statistical models are considered, of which at least some are misspecified. Recent work on self-consistency (SC) provides a promising remedy to this issue, accessible even for empirical data (without ground-truth labels). In this work, we investigate how SC can improve amortized model comparison conceptualized in four different ways. Across two synthetic and two real-world case studies, we find that approaches for model comparison that estimate marginal likelihoods through approximate parameter posteriors consistently outperform methods that directly approximate model evidence or posterior model probabilities. SC training improves robustness when the likelihood is available, even under severe model misspecification. The benefits of SC for methods without access of analytic likelihoods are more limited and inconsistent. Our results suggest practical guidance for reliable amortized Bayesian model comparison: prefer parameter posterior-based methods and augment them with SC training on empirical datasets to mitigate extrapolation bias under model misspecification.",

We show that our method provides guaranteed Marginal Coverage and Mask-Conditional Validity for general missing data mechanisms. A key component of our approach is a reweighted conformal prediction procedure that corrects the prediction sets after distributional imputation (multiple imputation) of the calibration dataset, making our method compatible with standard imputation pipelines. We derive two algorithms, and we show that they are approximately marginally valid and MCV. We evaluate them on synthetic and real-world datasets.

In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of function inlining through the lens of machine learning-based binary analysis. To this end, we dissect the inlining decision pipeline within the LLVM's cost model and explore the combinations of the compiler options that aggressively promote the function inlining ratio beyond standard optimization levels, which we term extreme inlining. We focus on five ML-assisted binary analysis tasks for security, using 20 unique models to systematically evaluate their robustness under extreme inlining scenarios. Our extensive experiments reveal several significant findings: i) function inlining, though a benign transformation in intent, can (in)directly affect ML model behaviors, being potentially exploited by evading discriminative or generative ML models; ii) ML models relying on static features can be highly sensitive to inlining; iii) subtle compiler settings can be leveraged to deliberately craft evasive binary variants; and iv) inlining ratios vary substantially across applications and build configurations, undermining assumptions of consistency in training and evaluation of ML models.",

Supporting this architecture is an extensible, modular tool library comprising more than a dozen core tools, such as keyelement detection, instance segmentation, and optical character recognition (OCR), which the agent dynamically orchestrates to achieve systematic visual parsing across diverse chart types. Leveraging TIRs transparency and verifiability, ChartAgent moves beyond the black box paradigm by standardizing and consolidating intermediate outputs into a structured Evidence Package, providing traceable and reproducible support for final conclusions.

Our approach employs two neural networks: one representing the moving interface and the other for the temperature field. The interface network allows rapid categorization of thermal diffusivity in the spatial domain, which is a crucial step for selecting training points for the temperature network. The temperature network's input is augmented with a modified zero-level set function to accurately capture the jump in its normal derivative across the interface. Numerical experiments on two-phase dynamical Stefan problems demonstrate the superior accuracy and effectiveness of our proposed method compared with the ones obtained by other neural network methodology in literature. The results indicate that the proposed framework offers a robust and flexible alternative to traditional numerical methods for solving phase-change problems governed by moving boundaries.

We address this long-standing limitation by extending the theory of generalized U-statistics and applying it to the usual MMD estimator, resulting in new characterization of the asymptotic distributions of the MMD estimator with unequal sample sizes (particularly outside the proportional regimes required by previous partial results). This generalization also provides a new criterion for optimizing the power of an MMD test with unequal sample sizes. Our approach preserves all available data, enhancing test accuracy and applicability in realistic settings. Along the way, we give much cleaner characterizations of the variance of MMD estimators, revealing something that might be surprising to those in the area: while zero MMD implies a degenerate estimator, it is sometimes possible to have a degenerate estimator with nonzero MMD as well; we give a construction and a proof that it does not happen in common situations.",

This begs the question whether we can emulate this behavior in synthetic matter and drive it to a point where the collective behavior reaches the complexity level of intelligent systems. Here, we will use a formalized notion of \"intelligent matter\" and compare it to recent results in the field of active matter. First, we will explore the approach of emergent computing in which specialized active matter systems are designed to directly solve a given task through emergent behavior.

Deep learning-based prostate gland segmentation approaches remain challenging due to anatomical variability. To bridge this efficiency gap while still maintaining reliable segmentation accuracy, we propose KLO-Net, a dynamic K-Nearest Neighbor attention U-Net with Cross Stage Partial, i.e., CSP, encoder for efficient prostate gland segmentation from MRI scan. Unlike the regular K-NN attention mechanism, the proposed dynamic K-NN attention mechanism allows the model to adaptively determine the number of attention connections for each spatial location within a slice. In addition, CSP blocks address the computational load to reduce memory consumption. To evaluate the model's performance, comprehensive experiments and ablation studies are conducted on two public datasets, i.e., PROMISE12 and PROSTATEx, to validate the proposed architecture. The detailed comparative analysis demonstrates the model's advantage in computational efficiency and segmentation quality.",

While permutation-based methods are a standard tool for this task, classical implementations rely on repeated random permutations, introducing computational overhead and stochastic instability. In this paper, we show that by replacing multiple random permutations with a single, deterministic, and optimal permutation, we achieve a method that retains the core principles of permutation-based importance while being non-random, faster, and more stable. We validate this approach across nearly 200 scenarios, including real-world household finance and credit risk applications, demonstrating improved bias-variance tradeoffs and accuracy in challenging regimes such as small sample sizes, high dimensionality, and low signal-to-noise ratios. Finally, we introduce Systemic Variable Importance, a natural extension designed for model stress-testing that explicitly accounts for feature correlations. This framework provides a transparent way to quantify how shocks or perturbations propagate through correlated inputs, revealing dependencies that standard variable importance measures miss. Two real-world case studies demonstrate how this metric can be used to audit models for hidden reliance on protected attributes (e.g., gender or race), enabling regulators and practitioners to assess fairness and systemic risk in a principled and computationally efficient manner.",

We propose a reinforcement learning (RL)-based method for designing pulse sequences on qubits. Our novel action set enables the RL agent to efficiently navigate this inherently non-convex optimization landscape. The action set, derived from Thompson's group $F$, is applicable to a broad class of sequential decision problems whose states can be represented as bounded sequences. We demonstrate that our RL agent can learn pulse sequences that minimize dephasing without requiring explicit knowledge of the underlying noise spectrum. This work opens the possibility for real-time learning of optimal dynamical decoupling sequences on qubits which are dephasing-limited. The model-free nature of our algorithm suggests that the agent may ultimately learn optimal pulse sequences even in the presence of unmodeled physical effects, such as pulse errors or non-Gaussian noise.",

This study systematically evaluated the multichannel linear descriptors-based block field method (MLD-BFM) for continuous decoding of five finger-joint DoFs by leveraging the rich spatial information of high-density surface electromyography (HD sEMG). Twenty-one healthy participants performed dynamic sinusoidal finger movements while HD sEMG signals were recorded from the \\textit{extensor digitorum communis} (EDC) and \\textit{flexor digitorum superficialis} (FDS) muscles. MLD-BFM extracted region-specific spatial features, including effective field strength ($Σ$), field-strength variation rate ($Φ$), and spatial complexity ($Ω$). Model performance was optimized (block size: $2 \\times 2$; window: 0.15 s) and compared with conventional time-domain features and dimensionality reduction approaches when applied to multi-output regression models. MLD-BFM consistently achieved the highest $\\mathrm{R}^2_{\\mathrm{vw}}$ values across all models. The multilayer perceptron (MLP) combined with MLD-BFM yielded the best performance ($\\mathrm{R}^2_{\\mathrm{vw}} = 86.68\\% \\pm 0.33$). Time-domain features also showed strong predictive capability and were statistically comparable to MLD-BFM in some models, whereas dimensionality reduction techniques exhibited lower accuracy. Decoding accuracy was higher for the middle and ring fingers than for the thumb. Overall, MLD-BFM improved continuous finger movement decoding accuracy, underscoring the importance of taking advantage of the spatial richness of HD sEMG. These findings suggest that spatially structured features enhance SPC and provide practical guidance for designing robust, real-time, and responsive myoelectric interfaces.",

The problem, however, is that unsupervised learning is a difficult challenge, necessitating huge computing resources, which may not always work. In the current work, we combine unsupervised and supervised learning using an autoencoder to establish that unlabeled data in the Majorana splitting in realistic short disordered nanowires may enable not only a distinction between `topological' and `trivial', but also where their crossover happens in the relevant parameter space.

A hybrid loss combining Huber loss with a spectral entropy term was introduced to preserve both temporal and frequency-domain fidelity. Using 2D tissue simulations incorporating healthy, fibrotic, and gap junction-remodelled conditions, the model achieved high accuracy (mean $R^2 = 0.99 \\pm 0.01$). Ablation studies confirmed the contributions of convolutional encoders, time-aware attention, and spectral entropy loss.

Our main technical result is a density theorem: under uniform tightness of agent outputs and a Lipschitz AAI functional, the subspace of batteries generated by mathematical theorem-proving and coding tasks is dense in the moduli space of batteries with respect to the evaluation metric. Coding alone is universal in this sense, while pure mathematics is not; its privilege is spectral rather than expressive.

These heterogeneities generate residual stresses over multiple length scales, whose partial release leads to process-induced deformation (PID), requiring accurate prediction and mitigation via optimized non-isothermal cure cycles. This study considers a unidirectional AS4 carbon fiber/amine bi-functional epoxy prepreg and models PID using a two-mechanism framework that accounts for thermal expansion/shrinkage and cure shrinkage. The model is validated against manufacturing trials to identify initial and boundary conditions, then used to generate PID responses for a diverse set of non-isothermal cure cycles (time-temperature profiles). Building on this physics-based foundation, we develop a data-driven surrogate based on Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets). A DeepONet is trained on a dataset combining high-fidelity simulations with targeted experimental measurements of PID. We extend this to a Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) DeepONet, where branch-network features are modulated by external parameters, including the initial degree of cure, enabling prediction of time histories of degree of cure, viscosity, and deformation. Because experimental data are available only at limited time instances (for example, final deformation), we use transfer learning: simulation-trained trunk and branch networks are fixed and only the final layer is updated using measured final deformation. Finally, we augment the framework with Ensemble Kalman Inversion (EKI) to quantify uncertainty under experimental conditions and to support optimization of cure schedules for reduced PID in composites.",

The Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) architecture, with its RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC) modules, has emerged as a pivotal solution for dynamic resource management and network slicing. While artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods have shown promise, most approaches struggle to maintain performance under unpredictable and highly dynamic conditions. This paper proposes an adaptive Meta Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (Meta-HRL) framework, inspired by Model Agnostic Meta Learning (MAML), to jointly optimize resource allocation and network slicing in O-RAN. The framework integrates hierarchical control with meta learning to enable both global and local adaptation: the high-level controller allocates resources across slices, while low level agents perform intra slice scheduling. The adaptive meta-update mechanism weights tasks by temporal difference error variance, improving stability and prioritizing complex network scenarios. Theoretical analysis establishes sublinear convergence and regret guarantees for the two-level learning process. Simulation results demonstrate a 19.8% improvement in network management efficiency compared with baseline RL and meta-RL approaches, along with faster adaptation and higher QoS satisfaction across eMBB, URLLC, and mMTC slices. Additional ablation and scalability studies confirm the method's robustness, achieving up to 40% faster adaptation and consistent fairness, latency, and throughput performance as network scale increases.",

Existing research focuses primarily on device identification within local networks using methods such as protocol fingerprinting and wireless frequency scanning. However, these approaches are limited in their ability to monitor or classify IoT devices externally. To address this gap, we investigate the use of machine learning (ML) techniques, specifically Random Forest (RF), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), and K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN), in conjunction with targeted network traffic monitoring to classify IoT device types and their actions. We constructed a testbed comprising an NPAT-enabled router and a diverse set of IoT devices, including smart cameras, controller hubs, home appliances, power controllers, and streaming devices. Experimental results demonstrate that IoT device and action recognition is feasible using our proposed ML-driven approach, with the RF classifier achieving the highest accuracy of 91%, while the MLP recorded the lowest accuracy at 56%. Notably, all device categories were successfully classified except for certain actions associated with security cameras, underscoring both the potential and the limitations of the proposed method.",

In contrast, artificial neural networks (ANNs) appear to mix all processing, because modular solutions are difficult to find as they are vanishing subspaces in the space of possible solutions. Here, we draw inspiration from fault-tolerant computation and the Poisson-like firing of real neurons to show that activity-dependent neural noise, combined with nonlinear neural responses, drives the emergence of solutions that reflect an accurate understanding of modular tasks, corresponding to acquisition of a correct world model. We find that noise-driven modularisation can be recapitulated by a deterministic regulariser that multiplicatively combines weights and activations, revealing rich phenomenology not captured in linear networks or by standard regularisation methods. Though the emergence of modular structure requires sufficiently many training samples (exponential in the number of modular task dimensions), we show that pre-modularised ANNs exhibit superior noise-robustness and the ability to generalise and extrapolate well beyond training data, compared to ANNs without such inductive biases. Together, our work demonstrates a regulariser and architectures that could encourage modularity emergence to yield functional benefits.",

        "summary": "This study explores the application of deep learning to improve and automate pollen grain detection and classification in both optical and holographic microscopy images, with a particular focus on veterinary cytology use cases. We used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for the classification task, evaluating their performance across imaging modalities. The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower. We addressed the performance gap issue through dataset expansion using automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement. These techniques, applied to holographic images, improved detection performance from 2.49% to 13.3% mAP50 and classification performance from 42% to 54%. Our work demonstrates that, at least for image classification tasks, it is possible to pair deep learning techniques with cost-effective lensless digital holographic microscopy devices.",

        "summary": "Humans learn by observing, interacting with environments, and internalizing physics and causality. Here, we aim to ask whether an agent can similarly acquire human-like reasoning from interaction and keep improving with more experience. We study this in a Game-to-Unseen (G2U) setting, curating 1,000+ heterogeneous games with diverse physical and causal mechanisms, and evaluate at three human-like levels: Survival, Curiosity, Utility, from primitive intuition to goal-driven reasoning. Our analysis reveals complementary failures: VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on three levels, matches GPT-5 overall, and surpasses it on Curiosity. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games. These results support physics-centric interaction as a path to steadily improving physical reasoning.",
