        "summary": "Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the problem of effectively finding efficient collision-free paths for a group of agents in a shared workspace. The MAPF community has largely focused on developing high-performance heuristic search methods. Recently, several works have applied various machine learning (ML) techniques to solve MAPF, usually involving sophisticated architectures, reinforcement learning techniques, and set-ups, but none using large amounts of high-quality supervised data. Our initial objective in this work was to show how simple large scale imitation learning of high-quality heuristic search methods can lead to state-of-the-art ML MAPF performance. However, we find that, at least with our model architecture, simple large scale (700k examples with hundreds of agents per example) imitation learning does \\textit{not} produce impressive results. Instead, we find that by using prior work that post-processes MAPF model predictions to resolve 1-step collisions (CS-PIBT), we can train a simple ML MAPF model in minutes that dramatically outperforms existing ML MAPF policies. This has serious implications for all future ML MAPF policies (with local communication) which currently struggle to scale. In particular, this finding implies that future learnt policies should (1) always use smart 1-step collision shields (e.g. CS-PIBT), (2) always include the collision shield with greedy actions as a baseline (e.g. PIBT) and (3) motivates future models to focus on longer horizon / more complex planning as 1-step collisions can be efficiently resolved.",

        "summary": "The rapid proliferation of Internet-of-things (IoT) as well as mobile devices such as Electric Vehicles (EVs), has led to unpredictable load at the grid. The demand to supply ratio is particularly exacerbated at a few grid aggregators (charging stations) with excessive demand due to the geographic location, peak time, etc. Existing solutions on demand response cannot achieve significant improvements based only on time-shifting the loads without considering the device properties such as charging modes and movement capabilities to enable geographic migration. Additionally, the information on the spare capacity at a few aggregators can aid in re-channeling the load from other aggregators facing excess demand to allow migration of devices. In this paper, we model these flexible properties of the devices as a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to minimize excess load and the improve the utility (benefit) across all devices. We propose an online distributed low-complexity heuristic that prioritizes devices based on demand and deadlines to minimize the cumulative loss in utility. The proposed heuristic is tested on an exhaustive set of synthetic data and compared with solutions from a solver/optimization tool for the same runtime to show the impracticality of using a solver. A real-world EV testbed data is also tested with our proposed solution and other scheduling solutions to show the practicality of generating a feasible schedule and a loss improvement of at least 57.23%.",

        "summary": "This work proposes a kinodynamic motion planning technique for collaborative object transportation by multiple mobile manipulators in dynamic environments. A global path planner computes a linear piecewise path from start to goal. A novel algorithm detects the narrow regions between the static obstacles and aids in defining the obstacle-free region to enhance the feasibility of the global path. We then formulate a local online motion planning technique for trajectory generation that minimizes the control efforts in a receding horizon manner. It plans the trajectory for finite time horizons, considering the kinodynamic constraints and the static and dynamic obstacles. The planning technique jointly plans for the mobile bases and the arms to utilize the locomotion capability of the mobile base and the manipulation capability of the arm efficiently. We use a convex cone approach to avoid self-collision of the formation by modifying the mobile manipulators admissible state without imposing additional constraints. Numerical simulations and hardware experiments showcase the efficiency of the proposed approach.",

        "summary": "Motion disorders pose a significant global health concern and are often managed with pharmacological treatments that may lead to undesirable long-term effects. Current therapeutic strategies lack differentiation between healthy and unhealthy muscles in a patient, necessitating a targeted approach to distinguish between musculature. There is still no motion analyzer application for this purpose. Additionally, there is a deep gap in motion analysis software as some studies prioritize simulation, neglecting software needs, while others concentrate on computational aspects, disregarding simulation nuances. We introduce a comprehensive five-phase methodology to analyze the neuromuscular system of the lower body during gait. The first phase employs an innovative IoT-based method for motion signal capture. The second and third phases involve an agent-driven biomechanical model of the lower body skeleton and a model of human voluntary muscle. Thus, using an agent-driven approach, motion-captured signals can be converted to neural stimuli. The simulation results are then analyzed by our proposed ensemble neural network framework in the fourth step in order to detect abnormal motion in each joint. Finally, the results are shown by a userfriendly graphical interface which promotes the usability of the method. Utilizing the developed application, we simulate the neuromusculoskeletal system of some patients during the gait cycle, enabling the classification of healthy and pathological muscle activity through joint-based analysis. This study leverages cloud computing to create an infrastructure-independent application which is globally accessible. The proposed application enables experts to differentiate between healthy and unhealthy muscles in a patient by simulating his gait.",

        "summary": "This paper addresses the problem of adaptively controlling the bias parameter in nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) to allocate agents into groups of arbitrary sizes for the purpose of maximizing collective rewards. In previous work, an algorithm based on the coupling of NOD with an multi-objective behavior optimization was successfully deployed as part of a multi-robot system in an autonomous task allocation field experiment. Motivated by the field results, in this paper we propose and analyze a new task allocation model that synthesizes NOD with an evolutionary game framework. We prove sufficient conditions under which it is possible to control the opinion state in the group to a desired allocation of agents between two tasks through an adaptive bias using decentralized feedback. We then verify the theoretical results with a simulation study of a collaborative evolutionary division of labor game.",
