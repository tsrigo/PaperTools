        "summary": "Evaluating security and reliability for multi-agent systems (MAS) is urgent as they become increasingly prevalent in various applications. As an evaluation technique, existing adversarial attack frameworks face certain limitations, e.g., impracticality due to the requirement of white-box information or high control authority, and a lack of stealthiness or effectiveness as they often target all agents or specific fixed agents. To address these issues, we propose AdapAM, a novel framework for adversarial attacks on black-box MAS. AdapAM incorporates two key components: (1) Adaptive Selection Policy simultaneously selects the victim and determines the anticipated malicious action (the action would lead to the worst impact on MAS), balancing effectiveness and stealthiness. (2) Proxy-based Perturbation to Induce Malicious Action utilizes generative adversarial imitation learning to approximate the target MAS, allowing AdapAM to generate perturbed observations using white-box information and thus induce victims to execute malicious action in black-box settings. We evaluate AdapAM across eight multi-agent environments and compare it with four state-of-the-art and commonly-used baselines. Results demonstrate that AdapAM achieves the best attack performance in different perturbation rates. Besides, AdapAM-generated perturbations are the least noisy and hardest to detect, emphasizing the stealthiness.",

        "summary": "In this work, we investigate constrained multi-agent reinforcement learning (CMARL), where agents collaboratively maximize the sum of their local objectives while satisfying individual safety constraints. We propose a framework where agents adopt coupled policies that depend on both local states and parameters, as well as those of their $κ_p$-hop neighbors, with $κ_p>0$ denoting the coupling distance. A distributed primal-dual algorithm is further developed under this framework, wherein each agent has access only to state-action pairs within its $2κ_p$-hop neighborhood and to reward information within its $κ+ 2κ_p$-hop neighborhood, with $κ> 0$ representing the truncation distance. Moreover, agents are not permitted to directly share their true policy parameters or Lagrange multipliers. Instead, each agent constructs and maintains local estimates of these variables for other agents and employs such estimates to execute its policy. Additionally, these estimates are further updated and exchanged exclusively through an independent, time-varying networks, which enhances the overall system security. We establish that, with high probability, our algorithm can achieve an $ε$-first-order stationary convergence with an approximation error of $\\mathcal{O}(γ^{\\frac{κ+1}{κ_{p}}})$ for discount factor $γ\\in(0,1)$. Finally, simulations in GridWorld environment are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.",

We define a geometric region, the evader's safe-reachable set, as the intersection of Apollonius circles derived from each pursuer-evader pair. The capture strategy is formulated as a zero-sum game where the pursuers cooperatively minimize the area of this set, while the evader seeks to maximize it, effectively playing a game of spatial containment. By deriving the analytical gradients of the safe-reachable set's area with respect to agent positions, we obtain closed-form, instantaneous optimal control laws for the heading of each agent. These strategies are computationally efficient, allowing for real-time implementation. Simulations demonstrate that the gradient-based controls effectively steer the pursuers to systematically shrink the evader's safe region, leading to guaranteed capture. This area-minimization approach provides a clear geometric objective for cooperative capture.",

Nevertheless, CNLG still remains difficult due to two main challenges. (1) Multi-objective flexibility: user requirements are often personalized, fine-grained, and pluralistic, which LLMs struggle to satisfy simultaneously; (2) Interpretive complexity: beyond generation, creativity also involves understanding and interpreting implicit meaning to enhance users' perception. These challenges significantly limit current methods, especially in short-form text generation, in generating creative and insightful content. To address this, we focus on Chinese baby naming, a representative short-form CNLG task requiring adherence to explicit user constraints (e.g., length, semantics, anthroponymy) while offering meaningful aesthetic explanations. We propose NAMeGEn, a novel multi-agent optimization framework that iteratively alternates between objective extraction, name generation, and evaluation to meet diverse requirements and generate accurate explanations. To support this task, we further construct a classical Chinese poetry corpus with 17k+ poems to enhance aesthetics, and introduce CBNames, a new benchmark with tailored metrics. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NAMeGEn effectively generates creative names that meet diverse, personalized requirements while providing meaningful explanations, outperforming six baseline methods spanning various LLM backbones without any training.",

        "summary": "Online social media platforms enable influencers to distribute content and quickly capture audience reactions, significantly shaping their promotional strategies and advertising agreements. Understanding how sentiment dynamics and emotional contagion unfold among followers is vital for influencers and marketers, as these processes shape engagement, brand perception, and purchasing behavior. While sentiment analysis tools effectively track sentiment fluctuations, dynamical models explaining their evolution remain limited, often neglecting network structures and interactions both among blogs and between their topic-focused follower groups. In this study, we tracked influential tech-focused Weibo bloggers over six months, quantifying follower sentiment from text-mined feedback. By treating each blogger's audience as a single \"macro-agent\", we find that sentiment trajectories follow the principle of iterative averaging -- a foundational mechanism in many dynamical models of opinion formation, a theoretical framework at the intersection of social network analysis and dynamical systems theory. The sentiment evolution aligns closely with opinion-dynamics models, particularly modified versions of the classical French-DeGroot model that incorporate delayed perception and distinguish between expressed and private opinions. The inferred influence structures reveal interdependencies among blogs that may arise from homophily, whereby emotionally similar users subscribe to the same blogs and collectively shape the shared sentiment expressed within these communities.",

        "summary": "We address the fundamental challenge of resolving symmetry-induced deadlocks in distributed multi-agent navigation by proposing a new hierarchical navigation method. When multiple agents interact, it is inherently difficult for them to autonomously break the symmetry of deciding how to pass each other. To tackle this problem, we introduce an approach that quantifies cooperative symmetry-breaking strategies using a topological invariant called the winding number, and learns the strategies themselves through reinforcement learning. Our method features a hierarchical policy consisting of a learning-based Planner, which plans topological cooperative strategies, and a model-based Controller, which executes them. Through reinforcement learning, the Planner learns to produce two types of parameters for the Controller: one is the topological cooperative strategy represented by winding numbers, and the other is a set of dynamic weights that determine which agent interaction to prioritize in dense scenarios where multiple agents cross simultaneously. The Controller then generates collision-free and efficient motions based on the strategy and weights provided by the Planner. This hierarchical structure combines the flexible decision-making ability of learning-based methods with the reliability of model-based approaches. Simulation and real-world robot experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing baselines, particularly in dense environments, by efficiently avoiding collisions and deadlocks while achieving superior navigation performance.

Unlike generic learned models, PCARNN explicitly preserves the control-affine structure of vehicle dynamics, ensuring the linearity required for reliable optimization. This enables the DCBF to enforce polygonal keep-in constraints via a real-time Quadratic Program (QP) that handles high relative degree and mitigates actuator saturation. Experiments in CARLA across electric and combustion platforms demonstrate that this structure-preserving approach significantly outperforms analytical and unstructured neural baselines.",

For the general agnostic case, we present an algorithm that achieves near-optimal sample complexity of $\\widetilde O((d + k) / ε^2)$ within $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt{k})$ rounds. Of independent interest, we introduce a new framework, Optimization via On-Demand Sampling (OODS), which abstracts the sample-adaptivity tradeoff and captures most existing MDL algorithms. We establish nearly tight bounds on the round complexity in the OODS setting. The upper bounds directly yield the $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt{k})$-round algorithm for agnostic MDL, while the lower bounds imply that achieving sub-polynomial round complexity would require fundamentally new techniques that bypass the inherent hardness of OODS.",

Leveraging the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK), NINT scores examples by the norm of their NTK-augmented loss gradients, capturing both fitting errors and heterogeneous leverage (self-influence and cross-coordinate coupling). This dual consideration enables faster convergence compared to existing methods. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that NINT significantly reduces training time by nearly half while maintaining or improving representation quality, establishing state-of-the-art acceleration among recent sampling-based strategies.",

The resulting mixed-integer non-convex problem is solved by relaxing binary selection variables and applying Lagrangian decomposition to handle global bandwidth coupling, followed by per-device subproblem optimization.

We apply this method to vibration data for assessing the health state of a bearing within a servo-press motor. The method transforms frequency domain reference signals into pseudo time-series patterns, generates aligned covariate and target signals, and uses the TSFM to predict probabilities how classified data corresponds to predefined labels. Leveraging the scalability of pre-trained models this method demonstrates efficacy across varied operational conditions.

We propose EVA-Net, a novel framework that recasts brain age as an interpretable anomaly detection problem. EVA-Net uses an efficient, sparsified-attention Transformer to model long EEG sequences. To handle noise and variability in imperfect data, it employs a Variational Information Bottleneck to learn a robust, compressed representation. For interpretability, this representation is aligned to a continuous prototype network that explicitly learns the normative healthy aging manifold. Trained on 1297 healthy subjects, EVA-Net achieves state-of-the-art accuracy. We validated its anomaly detection capabilities on an unseen cohort of 27 MCI and AD patients. This pathological group showed significantly higher brain-age gaps and a novel Prototype Alignment Error, confirming their deviation from the healthy manifold.

Preserving general capabilities while acquiring downstream domain knowledge is a central challenge for large language and multimodal models. Traditional continual learning methods, such as regularization, replay and architectural isolation, suffer from poor downstream performance, reliance on inaccessible historical data, or additional parameter overhead. While recent parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods can alleviate forgetting, their effectiveness strongly depends on the choice of parameters and update strategies. In this paper, we introduce PIECE, a Parameter Importance Estimation-based Continual Enhancement method that preserves general ability while efficiently learning domain knowledge without accessing prior training data or increasing model parameters. PIECE selectively updates only 0.1% of core parameters most relevant to new tasks, guided by two importance estimators: PIECE-F based on Fisher Information, and PIECE-S based on a second-order normalization that combines gradient and curvature information. Experiments across three language models and two multimodal models show that PIECE maintains general capabilities and achieves state-of-the-art continual learning performance across diverse downstream tasks.

This paper introduces a cost-aware prediction (CAP) framework that combines cost-benefit analysis assisted by large language model (LLM) agents to communicate the trade-offs involved in applying ML predictions. Materials and Methods: We developed an ML model predicting 1-year mortality in patients with heart failure (N = 30,021, 22% mortality) to identify those eligible for home care. We then introduced clinical impact projection (CIP) curves to visualize important cost dimensions - quality of life and healthcare provider expenses, further divided into treatment and error costs, to assess the clinical consequences of predictions. Finally, we used four LLM agents to generate patient-specific descriptions. The system was evaluated by clinicians for its decision support value. Results: The eXtreme gradient boosting (XGB) model achieved the best performance, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.804 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.792-0.816), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.529 (95% CI 0.502-0.558) and a Brier score of 0.135 (95% CI 0.130-0.140). Discussion: The CIP cost curves provided a population-level overview of cost composition across decision thresholds, whereas LLM-generated cost-benefit analysis at individual patient-levels. The system was well received according to the evaluation by clinicians. However, feedback emphasizes the need to strengthen the technical accuracy for speculative tasks. Conclusion: CAP utilizes LLM agents to integrate ML classifier outcomes and cost-benefit analysis for more transparent and interpretable decision support.",

In time series forecasting, however, ensemble methods remain underutilized, with simple linear combinations still considered state-of-the-art. In this paper, we systematically explore ensembling strategies for time series forecasting. We evaluate 33 ensemble models -- both existing and novel -- across 50 real-world datasets. Our results show that stacking consistently improves accuracy, though no single stacker performs best across all tasks. To address this, we propose a multi-layer stacking framework for time series forecasting, an approach that combines the strengths of different stacker models. We demonstrate that this method consistently provides superior accuracy across diverse forecasting scenarios. Our findings highlight the potential of stacking-based methods to improve AutoML systems for time series forecasting.",

In this paper, we present STREAM-VAE, a variational autoencoder for anomaly detection in automotive telemetry time-series data. Our model uses a dual-path encoder to separate slow drift and fast spike signal dynamics, and a decoder that represents transient deviations separately from the normal operating pattern. STREAM-VAE is designed for deployment, producing stable anomaly scores across operating modes for both in-vehicle monitors and backend fleet analytics. Experiments on an automotive telemetry dataset and the public SMD benchmark show that explicitly separating drift and spike dynamics improves robustness compared to strong forecasting, attention, graph, and VAE baselines.",

While adaptive polynomial filters, such as the discrete MeixnerNet, have emerged as a potential unified solution, their extension to the continuous domain and stability with unbounded coefficients remain open questions.

However, despite their empirical success, the internal mechanisms by which these models represent fundamental time-series concepts remain poorly understood. In this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of concept interpretability in TSFMs. Specifically, we examine: (i) which layers encode which concepts, (ii) whether concept parameters are linearly recoverable, (iii) how representations evolve in terms of concept disentanglement and abstraction across model depth, and (iv) how models process compositions of concepts. We systematically probe these questions using layer-wise analyses, linear recoverability tests, and representation similarity measures, providing a structured account of TSFM semantics. The resulting insights show that early layers mainly capture local, time-domain patterns (e.g., AR(1), level shifts, trends), while deeper layers encode dispersion and change-time signals, with spectral and warping factors remaining the hardest to recover linearly. In compositional settings, however, probe performance degrades, revealing interference between concepts. This highlights that while atomic concepts are reliably localized, composition remains a challenge, underscoring a key limitation in current TSFMs' ability to represent interacting temporal phenomena.",

Quant-Trim is agnostic to quantization schemes (symmetric/asymmetric,per-tensor/per-channel, INT8/INT4) and requires no vendor-specific graph changes.Across models and tasks, it narrows the FP,low-bit gap, reduces dependence on compiler heuristics/calibration, and avoids per-backend retraining.

SNAP maintains competitive accuracy even when adapting based on only 1% of the incoming data stream, demonstrating its robustness under infrequent updates.

Integrated with five state-of-the-art TTA algorithms, SNAP reduces latency by up to 93.12%, while keeping the accuracy drop below 3.3%, even across adaptation rates ranging from 1% to 50%.

System optimization is achieved by introducing a penalty term for grid power purchase variations. Simulation results demonstrate that under three typical scenarios (10%, 20%, and 30% renewable penetration), the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the system's comprehensive cost by 6.93%, 12.68%, and 13.59% respectively compared to the traditional TD3 algorithm. Concurrently, it reduces the average fluctuation amplitude of grid power purchases by 12.8%. Regarding energy storage management, the PVTD3 algorithm reduces the end-time state values of low-temperature thermal storage tanks by 7.67-17.67 units while maintaining high-temperature tanks within the 3.59-4.25 safety operating range. Multi-scenario comparative validation demonstrates that the proposed algorithm not only excels in economic efficiency and grid stability but also exhibits superior sustainable scheduling capabilities in energy storage device management.",

To address this, we propose Entropy stablilization via Proportional-Integral Control (EntroPIC), a novel method that adaptively adjusts the influence of positive and negative samples by dynamically tuning their loss coefficients. This approach stabilizes entropy throughout training, ensuring efficient exploration and steady progress. We provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis for both on-policy and off-policy learning settings, demonstrating that EntroPIC is effective at controlling entropy in large-scale LLM training.

Such decoupled structure not only harm the generation efficiency but also hinder the practical use of MAR for reinforcement learning (RL), an increasingly critical paradigm for generative model post-training.To address this fundamental issue, we introduce MARVAL (Masked Auto-regressive Variational Acceleration), a distillation-based framework that compresses the diffusion chain into a single AR generation step while preserving the flexible auto-regressive unmasking order. Such a distillation with MARVAL not only yields substantial inference acceleration but, crucially, makes RL post-training with verifiable rewards practical, resulting in scalable yet human-preferred fast generative models. Our contributions are twofold: (1) a novel score-based variational objective for distilling masked auto-regressive diffusion models into a single generation step without sacrificing sample quality; and (2) an efficient RL framework for masked auto-regressive models via MARVAL-RL. On ImageNet 256*256, MARVAL-Huge achieves an FID of 2.00 with more than 30 times speedup compared with MAR-diffusion, and MARVAL-RL yields consistent improvements in CLIP and image-reward scores on ImageNet datasets with entity names.

It is well known from statistical information theory that the Fisher information coincides with the Hessian of the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence. Thus, the metric Kähler potential relation is exactly achieved under relative entropy. We propose a Kähler potential derivative of complex Gaussian mixtures that has rough equivalence to the Fisher information metric while still being faithful to the underlying Kähler geometry. Computation of the metric via this potential is efficient, and through our potential, valid as a plurisubharmonic (PSH) function, large scale computational burden of automatic differentiation is displaced to small scale. We show that we can regularize the latent space with decoder geometry, and that we can sample in accordance with a weighted complex volume element. We demonstrate these strategies, at the exchange of sample variation, yield consistently smoother representations and fewer semantic outliers.",

        "summary": "Deep learning models perform best with abundant, high-quality labels, yet such conditions are rarely achievable in EEG-based emotion recognition. Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals are easily corrupted by artifacts and individual variability, while emotional labels often stem from subjective and inconsistent reports-making robust affective decoding particularly difficult. We propose an uncertainty-aware active learning framework that enhances robustness to label noise by jointly leveraging model uncertainty and cross-modal consistency. Instead of relying solely on EEG-based uncertainty estimates, the method evaluates cross-modal alignment to determine whether uncertainty originates from cognitive ambiguity or sensor noise. A representation alignment module embeds EEG and face features into a shared latent space, enforcing semantic coherence between modalities. Residual discrepancies are treated as noise-induced inconsistencies, and these samples are selectively queried for oracle feedback during active learning. This feedback-driven process guides the network toward reliable, informative samples and reduces the impact of noisy labels. Experiments on the ASCERTAIN dataset examine the efficiency and robustness of ours, highlighting its potential as a data-efficient and noise-tolerant approach for EEG-based affective decoding in brain-computer interface systems.",

The conventional TNM staging system is inadequate for personalized medicine. We aimed to develop and validate a novel multiple instance learning model TDAM-CRC using histopathological whole-slide images for accurate prognostic prediction and to uncover its underlying molecular mechanisms. We trained the model on the TCGA discovery cohort (n=581), validated it in an independent external cohort (n=1031), and further we integrated multi-omics data to improve model interpretability and identify novel prognostic biomarkers. The results demonstrated that the TDAM-CRC achieved robust risk stratification in both cohorts. Its predictive performance significantly outperformed the conventional clinical staging system and multiple state-of-the-art models. The TDAM-CRC risk score was confirmed as an independent prognostic factor in multivariable analysis. Multi-omics analysis revealed that the high-risk subtype is closely associated with metabolic reprogramming and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Through interaction network analysis, we identified and validated Mitochondrial Ribosomal Protein L37 (MRPL37) as a key hub gene linking deep pathomic features to clinical prognosis. We found that high expression of MRPL37, driven by promoter hypomethylation, serves as an independent biomarker of favorable prognosis. Finally, we constructed a nomogram incorporating the TDAM-CRC risk score and clinical factors to provide a precise and interpretable clinical decision-making tool for CRC patients. Our AI-driven pathological model TDAM-CRC provides a robust tool for improved CRC risk stratification, reveals new molecular targets, and facilitates personalized clinical decision-making.",

        "summary": "Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) have been widely utilized to support the decisions made by cardiologists when detecting and classifying arrhythmia from electrocardiograms. However, forming a CDSS for the arrhythmia classification task is challenging due to the varying lengths of arrhythmias. Although the onset time of arrhythmia varies, previously developed methods have not considered such conditions. Thus, we propose a framework that consists of (i) local and global extraction and (ii) local-global information fusion with attention to enable arrhythmia detection and classification within a constrained input length. The framework's performance was evaluated in terms of 10-class and 4-class arrhythmia detection, focusing on identifying the onset and ending point of arrhythmia episodes and their duration using the MIT-BIH arrhythmia database (MITDB) and the MIT-BIH atrial fibrillation database (AFDB). Duration, episode, and Dice score performances resulted in overall F1-scores of 96.45%, 82.05%, and 96.31% on the MITDB and 97.57%, 98.31%, and 97.45% on the AFDB, respectively. The results demonstrated statistically superior performance compared to those of the benchmark models. To assess the generalization capability of the proposed method, an MITDB-trained model and MIT-BIH malignant ventricular arrhythmia database-trained model were tested AFDB and MITDB, respectively. Superior performance was attained compared with that of a state-of-the-art model. The proposed method effectively captures both local and global information and dynamics without significant information loss. Consequently, arrhythmias can be detected with greater accuracy, and their occurrence times can be precisely determined, enabling the clinical field to develop more accurate treatment plans based on the proposed method.",

It is highly infectious and has the following symptoms: fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, the new loss of taste or smell, sore throat, congestion or runny nose, nausea or vomiting, and diarrhea. These symptoms vary in severity; some people with many risk factors have been known to have lengthy hospital stays or die from the disease. In this paper, we analyze patients' electronic health records (EHR) to predict the severity of their COVID-19 infection using the length of stay (LOS) as our measurement of severity. This is an imbalanced classification problem, as many people have a shorter LOS rather than a longer one. To combat this problem, we synthetically create alternate oversampled training data sets. Once we have this oversampled data, we run it through an Artificial Neural Network (ANN), which during training has its hyperparameters tuned using Bayesian optimization. We select the model with the best F1 score and then evaluate it and discuss it.",

Moreover, the education problem is inherently difficult because the learning process is only partially observable. We therefore develop a dynamic, time-series environment to simulate a classroom setting, with student-teacher interventions - including tutoring sessions, lectures, and exams. In particular, we design the simulated environment to allow for varying levels of probing interventions that can gather more information. Then, we develop reinforcement learning ITSs that combine learning the individual state of students while pulling from population information through the use of probing interventions. These interventions can reduce the difficulty of student estimation, but also introduce a cost-benefit decision to find a balance between probing enough to get accurate estimates and probing so often that it becomes disruptive to the student. We compare the efficacy of standard RL algorithms with several greedy rules-based heuristic approaches to find that they provide different solutions, but with similar results. We also highlight the difficulty of the problem with increasing levels of hidden information, and the boost that we get if we allow for probing interventions. We show the flexibility of both heuristic and RL policies with regards to changing student population distributions, finding that both are flexible, but RL policies struggle to help harder classes. Finally, we test different course structures with non-probing policies and we find that our policies are able to boost the performance of quiz and midterm structures more than we can in a finals-only structure, highlighting the benefit of having additional information.",

        "summary": "Neural networks exhibit severe brittleness to semantically irrelevant transformations. A mere 75ms electrocardiogram (ECG) phase shift degrades latent cosine similarity from 1.0 to 0.2, while sensor rotations collapse activity recognition performance with inertial measurement units (IMUs). We identify the root cause as \"laissez-faire\" representation learning, where latent spaces evolve unconstrained provided task performance is satisfied. We propose Structured Contrastive Learning (SCL), a framework that partitions latent space representations into three semantic groups: invariant features that remain consistent under given transformations (e.g., phase shifts or rotations), variant features that actively differentiate transformations via a novel variant mechanism, and free features that preserve task flexibility. This creates controllable push-pull dynamics where different latent dimensions serve distinct, interpretable purposes. The variant mechanism enhances contrastive learning by encouraging variant features to differentiate within positive pairs, enabling simultaneous robustness and interpretability. Our approach requires no architectural modifications and integrates seamlessly into existing training pipelines. Experiments on ECG phase invariance and IMU rotation robustness demonstrate superior performance: ECG similarity improves from 0.25 to 0.91 under phase shifts, while WISDM activity recognition achieves 86.65% accuracy with 95.38% rotation consistency, consistently outperforming traditional data augmentation. This work represents a paradigm shift from reactive data augmentation to proactive structural learning, enabling interpretable latent representations in neural networks.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable capabilities across various domains. The ability to call external tools further expands their capability to handle real-world tasks. However, LLMs often follow an opaque reasoning process, which limits their usefulness in high-stakes domains where solutions need to be trustworthy to end users. LLMs can choose solutions that are unreliable and difficult to troubleshoot, even if better options are available. We address this issue by forcing LLMs to use external -- more reliable -- tools to solve problems when possible. We present a framework built on the tool-calling capabilities of existing LLMs to enable them to select the most reliable and easy-to-troubleshoot solution path, which may involve multiple sequential tool calls. We refer to this framework as LIT (LLMs with Inspectable Tools). In order to support LIT, we introduce a new and challenging benchmark dataset of 1,300 questions and a customizable set of reliability cost functions associated with a collection of specialized tools. These cost functions summarize how reliable each tool is and how easy it is to troubleshoot. For instance, a calculator is reliable across domains, whereas a linear prediction model is not reliable if there is distribution shift, but it is easy to troubleshoot. A tool that constructs a random forest is neither reliable nor easy to troubleshoot. These tools interact with the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset and a new dataset of NeurIPS 2023 papers to solve mathematical, coding, and modeling problems of varying difficulty levels. We demonstrate that LLMs can achieve more reliable and informed problem-solving while maintaining task performance using our framework.",

        "summary": "As Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite constellations rapidly expand to hundreds and thousands of spacecraft, the need for distributed on-board machine learning becomes critical to address downlink bandwidth limitations. Federated learning (FL) offers a promising framework to conduct collaborative model training across satellite networks. Realizing its benefits in space naturally requires addressing space-specific constraints, from intermittent connectivity to dynamics imposed by orbital motion. This work presents the first systematic feasibility analysis of adapting off-the-shelf FL algorithms for satellite constellation deployment. We introduce a comprehensive \"space-ification\" framework that adapts terrestrial algorithms (FedAvg, FedProx, FedBuff) to operate under orbital constraints, producing an orbital-ready suite of FL algorithms. We then evaluate these space-ified methods through extensive parameter sweeps across 768 constellation configurations that vary cluster sizes (1-10), satellites per cluster (1-10), and ground station networks (1-13). Our analysis demonstrates that space-adapted FL algorithms efficiently scale to constellations of up to 100 satellites, achieving performance close to the centralized ideal. Multi-month training cycles can be reduced to days, corresponding to a 9x speedup through orbital scheduling and local coordination within satellite clusters. These results provide actionable insights for future mission designers, enabling distributed on-board learning for more autonomous, resilient, and data-driven satellite operations.",

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft offers a promising opportunity to alleviate urban traffic congestion. Thus, developing optimal takeoff trajectories for minimum energy consumption becomes essential for broader eVTOL aircraft applications. Conventional optimal control methods (such as dynamic programming and linear quadratic regulator) provide highly efficient and well-established solutions but are limited by problem dimensionality and complexity. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) emerges as a special type of artificial intelligence tackling complex, nonlinear systems; however, the training difficulty is a key bottleneck that limits DRL applications. To address these challenges, we propose the transformer-guided DRL to alleviate the training difficulty by exploring a realistic state space at each time step using a transformer. The proposed transformer-guided DRL was demonstrated on an optimal takeoff trajectory design of an eVTOL drone for minimal energy consumption while meeting takeoff conditions (i.e., minimum vertical displacement and minimum horizontal velocity) by varying control variables (i.e., power and wing angle to the vertical). Results presented that the transformer-guided DRL agent learned to take off with $4.57\\times10^6$ time steps, representing 25% of the $19.79\\times10^6$ time steps needed by a vanilla DRL agent. In addition, the transformer-guided DRL achieved 97.2% accuracy on the optimal energy consumption compared against the simulation-based optimal reference while the vanilla DRL achieved 96.3% accuracy. Therefore, the proposed transformer-guided DRL outperformed vanilla DRL in terms of both training efficiency as well as optimal design verification.",

We propose FinTRec, a transformer-based framework that addresses these challenges and its operational objectives in FS. While tree-based models have traditionally been preferred in FS due to their explainability and alignment with regulatory requirements, our study demonstrate that FinTRec offers a viable and effective shift toward transformer-based architectures. Through historic simulation and live A/B test correlations, we show FinTRec consistently outperforms the production-grade tree-based baseline. The unified architecture, when fine-tuned for product adaptation, enables cross-product signal sharing, reduces training cost and technical debt, while improving offline performance across all products. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive study of unified sequential recommendation modeling in FS that addresses both technical and business considerations.",

To address this issue, we propose Group Turn Policy Optimization (GTPO), a novel RL algorithm specifically designed for training LLMs on multi-turn TIR tasks. GTPO introduces three key innovations: (1) turn-level reward assignment that provides fine-grained feedback for individual turns, (2) return-based advantage estimation where normalized discounted returns are calculated as advantages, and (3) self-supervised reward shaping that exploits self-supervision signals from generated code to densify sparse binary outcome-based rewards. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that GTPO outperforms GRPO by 3.0% on average across diverse reasoning benchmarks, establishing its effectiveness for advancing complex mathematical reasoning in the real world.",

Building upon the nested learning paradigm, which decomposes models into multi-level optimization problems with fixed update frequencies, this work proposes dynamic nested hierarchies as the next evolutionary step in advancing artificial intelligence and machine learning. Dynamic nested hierarchies empower models to autonomously adjust the number of optimization levels, their nesting structures, and update frequencies during training or inference, inspired by neuroplasticity to enable self-evolution without predefined constraints. This innovation addresses the anterograde amnesia in existing models, facilitating true lifelong learning by dynamically compressing context flows and adapting to distribution shifts. Through rigorous mathematical formulations, theoretical proofs of convergence, expressivity bounds, and sublinear regret in varying regimes, alongside empirical demonstrations of superior performance in language modeling, continual learning, and long-context reasoning, dynamic nested hierarchies establish a foundational advancement toward adaptive, general-purpose intelligence.",

Compared with LLMs, human reasoning can derive corresponding modifications to the output based on certain kinds of changes to the input. This reasoning pattern, which relies on abstract rules that govern relationships between changes of data, has not been comprehensively described or evaluated in LLMs. In this paper, we formally define this reasoning pattern as the Derivation Relation (DR) and introduce the concept of Derivation Capability (DC), i.e. applying DR by making the corresponding modification to the output whenever the input takes certain changes. To assess DC, a systematically constructed evaluation framework named DEVAL is proposed and used to evaluate five popular LLMs and one Large Reasoning Model in seven mainstream tasks. The evaluation results show that mainstream LLMs, such as GPT-4o and Claude3.5, exhibit moderate DR recognition capabilities but reveal significant drop-offs on applying DR effectively in problem-solving scenarios. To improve this, we propose a novel prompt engineering approach called Derivation Prompting (DP). It achieves an average improvement of 15.2% in DC for all tested LLMs, outperforming commonly used prompt engineering techniques.",

        "summary": "Under real-analytic assumptions on decoder-only Transformers, recent work shows that the map from discrete prompts to last-token hidden states is generically injective on finite prompt sets. We refine this picture: for each layer $\\ell$ we define a collision discriminant $Δ^\\ell \\subset Θ$ and injective stratum $U^\\ell = Θ\\setminus Δ^\\ell$, and prove a dichotomy -- either the model is nowhere injective on the set, or $U^\\ell$ is open and dense and every $F^\\ell_θ$ is injective. Under mild non-singularity assumptions on the optimizer and an absolutely continuous initialization, generic injectivity persists along smooth training trajectories over any fixed horizon. We also treat symmetry groups $G$, showing that discriminants and injective strata descend to the quotient $Θ/G$, so injectivity is naturally a property of functional equivalence classes. We complement these results with an empirical study of layerwise geometric diagnostics. We define a separation margin and a co-Lipschitz (lower Lipschitz) constant between prompt space and last-token representation space, estimated via nearest-neighbor statistics on large prompt sets. Applying these diagnostics to pretrained LLaMA-3 and Qwen models, we study behavior across layers, sequence lengths, model scales, and 8- and 4-bit activation quantization. On our sampled prompts we see no collisions in full precision or at 8 bits, while 4-bit quantization induces a small number of collisions and markedly shrinks co-Lipschitz estimates. For a small GPT-2 trained from scratch, normalized metrics remain stable over training. Overall, the results suggest that Transformer representations are generically and persistently injective in the continuous-parameter idealization, while their practical invertibility can be probed using simple geometric diagnostics.",

        "summary": "Ultrasound offers a radiation-free, cost-effective solution for real-time visualization of spinal landmarks, paraspinal soft tissues and neurovascular structures, making it valuable for intraoperative guidance during spinal procedures. However, ultrasound suffers from inherent limitations in visualizing complete vertebral anatomy, in particular vertebral bodies, due to acoustic shadowing effects caused by bone. In this work, we present a novel multi-modal deep learning method for completing occluded anatomical structures in 3D ultrasound by leveraging complementary information from a single X-ray image. To enable training, we generate paired training data consisting of: (1) 2D lateral vertebral views that simulate X-ray scans, and (2) 3D partial vertebrae representations that mimic the limited visibility and occlusions encountered during ultrasound spine imaging. Our method integrates morphological information from both imaging modalities and demonstrates significant improvements in vertebral reconstruction (p < 0.001) compared to state of art in 3D ultrasound vertebral completion. We perform phantom studies as an initial step to future clinical translation, and achieve a more accurate, complete volumetric lumbar spine visualization overlayed on the ultrasound scan without the need for registration with preoperative modalities such as computed tomography. This demonstrates that integrating a single X-ray projection mitigates ultrasound's key limitation while preserving its strengths as the primary imaging modality.

        "summary": "Parameter estimation remains a challenging task across many areas of engineering. Because data acquisition can often be costly, limited, or prone to inaccuracies (noise, uncertainty) it is crucial to identify sensor configurations that provide the maximum amount of information about the unknown parameters, in particular for the case of distributed-parameter systems, where spatial variations are important. Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have recently emerged as a powerful machine-learning (ML) tool for parameter estimation, particularly in cases with sparse or noisy measurements, overcoming some of the limitations of traditional optimization-based and Bayesian approaches. Despite the widespread use of PINNs for solving inverse problems, relatively little attention has been given to how their performance depends on sensor placement. This study addresses this gap by introducing a comprehensive PINN-based framework that simultaneously tackles optimal sensor placement and parameter estimation. Our approach involves training a PINN model in which the parameters of interest are included as additional inputs. This enables the efficient computation of sensitivity functions through automatic differentiation, which are then used to determine optimal sensor locations exploiting the D-optimality criterion. The framework is validated on two illustrative distributed-parameter reaction-diffusion-advection problems of increasing complexity. The results demonstrate that our PINNs-based methodology consistently achieves higher accuracy compared to parameter values estimated from intuitively or randomly selected sensor positions.",

        "summary": "In multi-objective optimization, multiple loss terms are weighted and added together to form a single objective. These weights are chosen to properly balance the competing losses according to some meta-goal. For example, in physics-informed neural networks (PINNs), these weights are often adaptively chosen to improve the network's generalization error. A popular choice of adaptive weights is based on the neural tangent kernel (NTK) of the PINN, which describes the evolution of the network in predictor space during training. The convergence of such an adaptive weighting algorithm is not clear a priori. Moreover, these NTK-based weights would be updated frequently during training, further increasing the computational burden of the learning process. In this paper, we prove that under appropriate conditions, gradient descent enhanced with adaptive NTK-based weights is convergent in a suitable sense. We then address the problem of computational efficiency by developing a randomized algorithm inspired by a predictor-corrector approach and matrix sketching, which produces unbiased estimates of the NTK up to an arbitrarily small discretization error. Finally, we provide numerical experiments to support our theoretical findings and to show the efficacy of our randomized algorithm. Code Availability: https://github.com/maxhirsch/Efficient-NTK",

However, Host processors and PIM cores require different data layouts: Hosts need consecutive elements distributed across DRAM banks, while PIM cores need them within local banks. This necessitates data rearrangements in ML kernel execution that pose significant performance and programmability challenges, further exacerbated by the need to support diverse PIM backends. Current compilation approaches lack systematic optimization for diverse ML kernels across multiple PIM backends and may largely ignore data rearrangements during compute code optimization. We demonstrate that data rearrangements and compute code optimization are interdependent, and need to be jointly optimized during the tuning process. To address this, we design DCC, the first data-centric ML compiler for PIM systems that jointly co-optimizes data rearrangements and compute code in a unified tuning process. DCC integrates a multi-layer PIM abstraction that enables various data distribution and processing strategies on different PIM backends. DCC enables effective co-optimization by mapping data partitioning strategies to compute loop partitions, applying PIM-specific code optimizations and leveraging a fast and accurate performance prediction model to select optimal configurations. Our evaluations in various individual ML kernels demonstrate that DCC achieves up to 7.68x speedup (2.7x average) on HBM-PIM and up to 13.17x speedup (5.75x average) on AttAcc PIM backend over GPU-only execution.

The proposed RS-CA-HSICT framework is composed of an HSICT block, a residual CNN module, a spatial CNN block, and a CA, which enhances the diverse feature space, detailed lesion information, and long-range dependencies. The new HSICT module first integrates an abstract representation of the stem CNN and customized ICT blocks for efficient multihead attention and structured CNN layers with homogeneous (H) and structural (S) operations. The customized ICT blocks learn global contextual interactions and local texture extraction. Additionally, H and S layers learn spatial homogeneity and fine structural details by reducing noise and modeling complex morphological variations. Moreover, inverse residual learning enhances vanishing gradient, and stage-wise resolution reduction ensures scale invariance. Furthermore, the RS-CA-HSICT framework augments the learned HSICT channels with the TL-driven Residual and Spatial CNN maps for enhanced multiscale feature space capturing global and localized structural cues, subtle texture, and contrast variations. These channels, preceding augmentation, are refined through the Channel-Fusion-and-Attention block, which preserves discriminative channels while suppressing redundant ones, thereby enabling efficient computation. Finally, the spatial attention mechanism refines pixel selection to detect subtle patterns and intra-class contrast variations in Mpox. Experimental results on both the Kaggle benchmark and a diverse MPox dataset reported classification accuracy as high as 98.30% and an F1-score of 98.13%, which outperforms the existing CNNs and ViTs.",

To address this, we propose Sigmma, a multi-modal contrastive alignment framework for learning hierarchical representations of HE images and spatial transcriptome profiles across multiple scales. Sigmma introduces multi-scale contrastive alignment, ensuring that representations learned at different scales remain coherent across modalities. Furthermore, by representing cell interactions as a graph and integrating inter- and intra-subgraph relationships, our approach effectively captures cell-cell interactions, ranging from fine to coarse, within the tissue microenvironment. We demonstrate that Sigmm learns representations that better capture cross-modal correspondences, leading to an improvement of avg. 9.78\\% in the gene-expression prediction task and avg. 26.93\\% in the cross-modal retrieval task across datasets.

Traditional numerical methods, like finite difference and finite element approaches, are widely used to solve governing partial differential equations (PDEs) such as the Helmholtz equation. However, these methods face significant computational challenges when applied to high-frequency wave problems in complex two-dimensional domains. This work investigates Finite Basis Physics-Informed Neural Networks (FBPINNs) and their multilevel extensions as a promising alternative. These methods leverage domain decomposition, partitioning the computational domain into overlapping sub-domains, each governed by a local neural network. We assess their accuracy and computational efficiency in solving the Helmholtz equation for the homogeneous case, demonstrating their potential to mitigate the limitations of traditional approaches.",

        "summary": "Data-Free Quantization (DFQ) offers a practical solution for model compression without requiring access to real data, making it particularly attractive in privacy-sensitive scenarios. While DFQ has shown promise for unimodal models, its extension to Vision-Language Models such as Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models remains underexplored. In this work, we reveal that directly applying existing DFQ techniques to CLIP results in substantial performance degradation due to two key limitations: insufficient semantic content and low intra-image diversity in synthesized samples. To tackle these challenges, we propose D4C, the first DFQ framework tailored for CLIP. D4C synthesizes semantically rich and structurally diverse pseudo images through three key components: (1) Prompt-Guided Semantic Injection aligns generated images with real-world semantics using text prompts; (2) Structural Contrastive Generation reproduces compositional structures of natural images by leveraging foreground-background contrastive synthesis; and (3) Perturbation-Aware Enhancement applies controlled perturbations to improve sample diversity and robustness. These components jointly empower D4C to synthesize images that are both semantically informative and structurally diverse, effectively bridging the performance gap of DFQ on CLIP. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of D4C, showing significant performance improvements on various bit-widths and models. For example, under the W4A8 setting with CLIP ResNet-50 and ViT-B/32, D4C achieves Top-1 accuracy improvement of 12.4% and 18.9% on CIFAR-10, 6.8% and 19.7% on CIFAR-100, and 1.4% and 5.7% on ImageNet-1K in zero-shot classification, respectively.",

We introduce a simple post-hoc framework that constructs confidence masks with distribution-free, image-level control of false-positive predictions. Given any pretrained segmentation model, we define a nested family of shrunken masks obtained either by increasing the score threshold or by applying morphological erosion. A labeled calibration set is used to select a single shrink parameter via conformal prediction, ensuring that, for new images that are exchangeable with the calibration data, the proportion of false positives retained in the confidence mask stays below a user-specified tolerance with high probability. The method is model-agnostic, requires no retraining, and provides finite-sample guarantees regardless of the underlying predictor. Experiments on a polyp-segmentation benchmark demonstrate target-level empirical validity. Our framework enables practical, risk-aware segmentation in settings where over-segmentation can have clinical consequences. Code at https://github.com/deel-ai-papers/conseco.",

        "summary": "Developing reliable UAV navigation systems requires robust air-to-air object detectors capable of distinguishing between objects seen during training and previously unseen objects. While many methods address closed-set detection and achieve high-confidence recognition of in-domain (ID) targets, they generally do not tackle open-set detection, which requires simultaneous handling of both ID and out-of-distribution (OOD) objects. Existing open-set approaches typically rely on a single uncertainty score with thresholding, limiting flexibility and often conflating OOD objects with background clutter. In contrast, we propose a lightweight, model-agnostic post-processing framework that explicitly separates background from unknown objects while preserving the base detector's performance. Our approach extends open-set detection beyond binary ID/OOD classification to real-time three-way classification among ID targets, OOD objects, and background. To this end, we employ a fusion scheme that aggregates multiple confidence estimates and per-detection features using a compact multilayer perceptron (MLP). Incorporating different logit variants into the MLP consistently enhances performance across both binary and three-class classification without compromising throughput. Extensive ablation and comparative experiments confirm that our method surpasses threshold-based baselines in two-class classification by an average of 2.7% AUROC, while retaining or improving open-set mAP. Furthermore, our study uniquely enables robust three-class classification, a critical capability for safe UAV navigation, where OOD objects must be actively avoided and background regions safely ignored. Comparative analysis highlights that our method surpasses competitive techniques in AUROC across datasets, while improving closed-set mAP by up to 9 points, an 18% relative gain.",

        "summary": "In high-dimensional statistics, the Lasso is a cornerstone method for simultaneous variable selection and parameter estimation. However, its reliance on the squared loss function renders it highly sensitive to outliers and heavy-tailed noise, potentially leading to unreliable model selection and biased estimates. To address this limitation, we introduce the Exponential Lasso, a novel robust method that integrates an exponential-type loss function within the Lasso framework. This loss function is designed to achieve a smooth trade-off between statistical efficiency under Gaussian noise and robustness against data contamination. Unlike other methods that cap the influence of large residuals, the exponential loss smoothly redescends, effectively downweighting the impact of extreme outliers while preserving near-quadratic behavior for small errors. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that the Exponential Lasso achieves strong statistical convergence rates, matching the classical Lasso under ideal conditions while maintaining its robustness in the presence of heavy-tailed contamination. Computationally, the estimator is optimized efficiently via a Majorization-Minimization (MM) algorithm that iteratively solves a series of weighted Lasso subproblems. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is highly competitive, outperforming the classical Lasso in contaminated settings and maintaining strong performance even under Gaussian noise.

To address this, we introduce a new adversary whose budget is only bounded in the frequency of corruptions, not in their magnitude. We then derive RCGP-UCB, an algorithm coupling the famous upper confidence bound (UCB) approach with a Robust Conjugate Gaussian Process (RCGP). We present stable and adaptive versions of RCGP-UCB, and prove that they achieve sublinear regret in the presence of up to $O(T^{1/2})$ and $O(T^{1/3})$ corruptions with possibly infinite magnitude. This robustness comes at near zero cost: without outliers, RCGP-UCB's regret bounds match those of the standard GP-UCB algorithm.",

Since policy optimization requires counterfactual feedback that historical data cannot provide, we employ the Queue-Reactive Model to generate realistic and tractable limit order book simulations that encompass transient price impact, and nonlinear and dynamic order flow responses. Methodologically, we train a Double Deep Q-Network agent on a state space comprising time, inventory, price, and depth variables, and evaluate its performance against established benchmarks. Numerical simulation results show that the agent learns a policy that is both strategic and tactical, adapting effectively to order book conditions and outperforming standard approaches across multiple training configurations.

        "summary": "Machine learning (ML) methods have become powerful tools for predicting material properties with near first-principles accuracy and vastly reduced computational cost. However, the performance of ML models critically depends on the quality, size, and diversity of the training dataset. In materials science, this dependence is particularly important for learning from low-symmetry atomistic configurations that capture thermal excitations, structural defects, and chemical disorder, features that are ubiquitous in real materials but underrepresented in most datasets. The absence of systematic strategies for generating representative training data may therefore limit the predictive power of ML models in technologically critical fields such as energy conversion and photonics. In this work, we assess the effectiveness of graph neural network (GNN) models trained on two fundamentally different types of datasets: one composed of randomly generated atomic configurations and another constructed using physically informed sampling based on lattice vibrations. As a case study, we address the challenging task of predicting electronic and mechanical properties of a prototypical family of optoelectronic materials under realistic finite-temperature conditions. We find that the phonons-informed model consistently outperforms the randomly trained counterpart, despite relying on fewer data points. Explainability analyses further reveal that high-performing models assign greater weight to chemically meaningful bonds that control property variations, underscoring the importance of physically guided data generation. Overall, this work demonstrates that larger datasets do not necessarily yield better GNN predictive models and introduces a simple and general strategy for efficiently constructing high-quality training data in materials informatics.",

We provide the first comprehensive study grounding ID in interpretable text properties through cross-encoder analysis, linguistic features, and sparse autoencoders (SAEs). In this work, we establish three key findings. First, ID is complementary to entropy-based metrics: after controlling for length, the two are uncorrelated, with ID capturing geometric complexity orthogonal to prediction quality. Second, ID exhibits robust genre stratification: scientific prose shows low ID (~8), encyclopedic content medium ID (~9), and creative/opinion writing high ID (~10.5) across all models tested. This reveals that contemporary LLMs find scientific text \"representationally simple\" while fiction requires additional degrees of freedom. Third, using SAEs, we identify causal features: scientific signals (formal tone, report templates, statistics) reduce ID; humanized signals (personalization, emotion, narrative) increase it. Steering experiments confirm these effects are causal. Thus, for contemporary models, scientific writing appears comparatively \"easy\", whereas fiction, opinion, and affect add representational degrees of freedom. Our multi-faceted analysis provides practical guidance for the proper use of ID and the sound interpretation of ID-based results.",

To address these challenges, we formulate a multi-role RL system where three (groups of) policy networks act as specialized agents: a task routing agent incorporates an attention-based similarity recognition module to determine source-target transfer pairs via attention scores; a knowledge control agent determines the proportion of elite solutions to transfer; and a group of strategy adaptation agents control transfer strength by dynamically controlling hyper-parameters in the underlying EMT framework. Through pre-training all network modules end-to-end over an augmented multitask problem distribution, a generalizable meta-policy is obtained.

Traditional regression and CNN-based methods face limitations such as manual feature engineering, limited receptive fields, and overfitting on heterogeneous data. Pure transformer models, while effective, require large datasets and high computational cost. We propose Brain ResNet over trained Vision Transformer (BrainRotViT), a hybrid architecture that combines the global context modeling of vision transformers (ViT) with the local refinement of residual CNNs. A ViT encoder is first trained on an auxiliary age and sex classification task to learn slice-level features. The frozen encoder is then applied to all sagittal slices to generate a 2D matrix of embedding vectors, which is fed into a residual CNN regressor that incorporates subject sex at the final fully-connected layer to estimate continuous brain age. Our method achieves an MAE of 3.34 years (Pearson $r=0.98$, Spearman $ρ=0.97$, $R^2=0.95$) on validation across 11 MRI datasets encompassing more than 130 acquisition sites, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art models. It also generalizes well across 4 independent cohorts with MAEs between 3.77 and 5.04 years. Analyses on the brain age gap (the difference between the predicted age and actual age) show that aging patterns are associated with Alzheimer's disease, cognitive impairment, and autism spectrum disorder. Model attention maps highlight aging-associated regions of the brain, notably the cerebellar vermis, precentral and postcentral gyri, temporal lobes, and medial superior frontal gyrus. Our results demonstrate that this method provides an efficient, interpretable, and generalizable framework for brain-age prediction, bridging the gap between CNN- and transformer-based approaches while opening new avenues for aging and neurodegeneration research.",

To address these gaps, we present a scalable framework to evaluate VLMs in Indian languages and compare it with performance in English.

Therefore, this study aims to comprehensively link multiple plant phenotypic traits and daily light integral considering the physiological responses of crops to their growth outcomes under SF using artificial intelligence. Between 2021 and 2024, various leafy, fruiting, and root crops were grown in greenhouses covered with either PEF or SF, and leaf reflectance, leaf mass per area, chlorophyll content, daily light integral, and light saturation point were measured from the plants cultivated in each condition. 210 data points were collected, but there was insufficient data to train deep learning models, so a variational autoencoder was used for data augmentation. Most crop yields showed an average increase of 22.5% under SF. These data were used to train several models, including logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, XGBoost, and feedforward neural network (FFNN), aiming to binary classify whether there was a significant effect on yield with SF application. The FFNN achieved a high classification accuracy of 91.4% on a test dataset that was not used for training.

To address this issue, we propose TASA (Teaching According to Students' Aptitude), a student-aware tutoring framework that integrates persona, memory, and forgetting dynamics for personalized mathematics learning. Specifically, TASA maintains a structured student persona capturing proficiency profiles and an event memory recording prior learning interactions. By incorporating a continuous forgetting curve with knowledge tracing, TASA dynamically updates each student's mastery state and generates contextually appropriate, difficulty-calibrated questions and explanations. Empirical results demonstrate that TASA achieves superior learning outcomes and more adaptive tutoring behavior compared to representative baselines, underscoring the importance of modeling temporal forgetting and learner profiles in LLM-based tutoring systems.",

        "summary": "Wireless foundation models (WFMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities, jointly performing multiple wireless functions and adapting effectively to new environments. However, while current WFMs process only one modality, depending on the task and operating conditions, the most informative modality changes and no single modality is best for all tasks. WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities. We believe this provides a concrete step toward both AI-native 6G and the vision of joint sensing, communication, and localization.",

Automating natural, trainer-style feedback promises timely, accessible, and consistent guidance at scale but requires models that understand clinically relevant representations. We present a structure-aware pipeline that learns a surgical action ontology from real trainer-to-trainee transcripts (33 surgeries) and uses it to condition feedback generation. We contribute by (1) mining Instrument-Action-Target (IAT) triplets from real-world feedback text and clustering surface forms into normalized categories, (2) fine-tuning a video-to-IAT model that leverages the surgical procedure and task contexts as well as fine-grained temporal instrument motion, and (3) demonstrating how to effectively use IAT triplet representations to guide GPT-4o in generating clinically grounded, trainer-style feedback. We show that, on Task 1: Video-to-IAT recognition, our context injection and temporal tracking deliver consistent AUC gains (Instrument: 0.67 to 0.74; Action: 0.60 to 0.63; Tissue: 0.74 to 0.79). For Task 2: feedback text generation (rated on a 1-5 fidelity rubric where 1 = opposite/unsafe, 3 = admissible, and 5 = perfect match to a human trainer), GPT-4o from video alone scores 2.17, while IAT conditioning reaches 2.44 (+12.4%), doubling the share of admissible generations with score >= 3 from 21% to 42%. Traditional text-similarity metrics also improve: word error rate decreases by 15-31% and ROUGE (phrase/substring overlap) increases by 9-64%. Grounding generation in explicit IAT structure improves fidelity and yields clinician-verifiable rationales, supporting auditable use in surgical training.",

We leverage Approximate Rank Pooling (ARP) to efficiently encode three-dimensional volumetric brain data into information-rich, two-dimensional dynamic representations, and then employ a dynamic curriculum learning strategy, guided by a Dynamic Group Mechanism (DGM), to progressively train the decoder, refining feature extraction from global anatomical structures to fine pathological details. Evaluated across six publicly available datasets, including Alzheimer's disease and brain tumor classification, cerebral artery segmentation, and brain age prediction, DCL-SE consistently outperforms existing methods in accuracy, robustness, and interpretability.

        "summary": "Conformal prediction (CP) constructs uncertainty sets for model outputs with finite-sample coverage guarantees. A candidate output is included in the prediction set if its non-conformity score is not considered extreme relative to the scores observed on a set of calibration examples. However, this procedure is only straightforward when scores are scalar-valued, which has limited CP to real-valued scores or ad-hoc reductions to one dimension. The problem of ordering vectors has been studied via optimal transport (OT), which provides a principled method for defining vector-ranks and multivariate quantile regions, though typically with only asymptotic coverage guarantees. We restore finite-sample, distribution-free coverage by conformalizing the vector-valued OT quantile region. Here, a candidate's rank is defined via a transport map computed for the calibration scores augmented with that candidate's score. This defines a continuum of OT problems for which we prove that the resulting optimal assignment is piecewise-constant across a fixed polyhedral partition of the score space. This allows us to characterize the entire prediction set tractably, and provides the machinery to address a deeper limitation of prediction sets: that they only indicate which outcomes are plausible, but not their relative likelihood. In one dimension, conformal predictive distributions (CPDs) fill this gap by producing a predictive distribution with finite-sample calibration. Extending CPDs beyond one dimension remained an open problem. We construct, to our knowledge, the first multivariate CPDs with finite-sample calibration, i.e., they define a valid multivariate distribution where any derived uncertainty region automatically has guaranteed coverage. We present both conservative and exact randomized versions, the latter resulting in a multivariate generalization of the classical Dempster-Hill procedure.",

We prove that under generic non-degenerate assumptions on the link function, a standard two-layer neural network trained via layer-wise gradient descent can agnostically learn the target with $o_d(1)$ test error using $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d)$ samples and $\\widetilde{\\mathcal{O}}(d^2)$ time. The sample and time complexity both align with the information-theoretic limit up to leading order and are therefore optimal. During the first stage of gradient descent learning, the proof proceeds via showing that the inner weights can perform a power-iteration process. This process implicitly mimics a spectral start for the whole span of the hidden subspace and eventually eliminates finite-sample noise and recovers this span. It surprisingly indicates that optimal results can only be achieved if the first layer is trained for more than $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ steps.

        "summary": "Modern AI workloads, especially Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, increasingly demand low-latency, fine-grained GPU-to-GPU communication with device-side control. Traditional GPU communication follows a host-initiated model, where the CPU orchestrates all communication operations - a characteristic of the CUDA runtime. Although robust for collective operations, applications requiring tight integration of computation and communication can benefit from device-initiated communication that eliminates CPU coordination overhead. NCCL 2.28 introduces the Device API with three operation modes: Load/Store Accessible (LSA) for NVLink/PCIe, Multimem for NVLink SHARP, and GPU-Initiated Networking (GIN) for network RDMA. This paper presents the GIN architecture, design, semantics, and highlights its impact on MoE communication. GIN builds on a three-layer architecture: i) NCCL Core host-side APIs for device communicator setup and collective memory window registration; ii) Device-side APIs for remote memory operations callable from CUDA kernels; and iii) A network plugin architecture with dual semantics (GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated and Proxy) for broad hardware support. The GPUDirect Async Kernel-Initiated backend leverages DOCA GPUNetIO for direct GPU-to-NIC communication, while the Proxy backend provides equivalent functionality via lock-free GPU-to-CPU queues over standard RDMA networks. We demonstrate GIN's practicality through integration with DeepEP, an MoE communication library. Comprehensive benchmarking shows that GIN provides device-initiated communication within NCCL's unified runtime, combining low-latency operations with NCCL's collective algorithms and production infrastructure.",

Although reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved superhuman performance in many domains, relatively little attention has been focused on designing human-like RL agents. As a result, many reward-driven RL agents often exhibit unnatural behaviors compared to humans, raising concerns for both interpretability and trustworthiness. To achieve human-like behavior in RL, this paper first formulates human-likeness as trajectory optimization, where the objective is to find an action sequence that closely aligns with human behavior while also maximizing rewards, and adapts the classic receding-horizon control to human-like learning as a tractable and efficient implementation. To achieve this, we introduce Macro Action Quantization (MAQ), a human-like RL framework that distills human demonstrations into macro actions via Vector-Quantized VAE. Experiments on D4RL Adroit benchmarks show that MAQ significantly improves human-likeness, increasing trajectory similarity scores, and achieving the highest human-likeness rankings among all RL agents in the human evaluation study. Our results also demonstrate that MAQ can be easily integrated into various off-the-shelf RL algorithms, opening a promising direction for learning human-like RL agents.

Together, these components enable stable, non-blocking precision transitions under strict HBM budgets. Across Qwen3-30B and Qwen3-80B MoE models and six representative benchmarks, DynaExq deploys large LLMs on single RTX 5090 and A6000 GPUs and improves accuracy by up to 4.03 points over static low-precision baselines.

Traditional analytical techniques such as the Critical Path Method (CPM) and Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT) rely on simplified and often static assumptions regarding task interdependencies and resource performance. This study proposes a novel resource-based predictive framework that integrates network representations of project activities with graph neural networks (GNNs) to capture structural and contextual relationships among tasks, resources, and time-cost dynamics. The model represents the project as a heterogeneous activity-resource graph in which nodes denote activities and resources, and edges encode temporal and resource dependencies. We evaluate multiple learning paradigms, including GraphSAGE and Temporal Graph Networks, on both synthetic and benchmark project datasets. Experimental results show that the proposed GNN framework achieves an average 23 to 31 percent reduction in mean absolute error compared to traditional regression and tree-based methods, while improving the coefficient of determination R2 from approximately 0.78 to 0.91 for large and complex project networks.

Our method introduces an adaptive and selective SAM mechanism, where regularization is explicitly driven by temporal-difference (TD)-error variance, ensuring that only agents facing high environmental complexity are regularized. This targeted strategy reduces unnecessary overhead, improves training stability, and enhances generalization without sacrificing learning efficiency. We further incorporate a dynamic $ρ$ scheduling scheme to refine the exploration-exploitation trade-off across agents. Experimental results show our method significantly outperforms conventional DRL approaches, yielding up to a $22\\%$ improvement in resource allocation efficiency and ensuring superior QoS satisfaction across diverse O-RAN slices.",

The framework comprises three core line-up of models: Kandinsky 5.0 Image Lite - a line-up of 6B parameter image generation models, Kandinsky 5.0 Video Lite - a fast and lightweight 2B parameter text-to-video and image-to-video models, and Kandinsky 5.0 Video Pro - 19B parameter models that achieves superior video generation quality. We provide a comprehensive review of the data curation lifecycle - including collection, processing, filtering and clustering - for the multi-stage training pipeline that involves extensive pre-training and incorporates quality-enhancement techniques such as self-supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training. We also present novel architectural, training, and inference optimizations that enable Kandinsky 5.0 to achieve high generation speeds and state-of-the-art performance across various tasks, as demonstrated by human evaluation. As a large-scale, publicly available generative framework, Kandinsky 5.0 leverages the full potential of its pre-training and subsequent stages to be adapted for a wide range of generative applications. We hope that this report, together with the release of our open-source code and training checkpoints, will substantially advance the development and accessibility of high-quality generative models for the research community.",

The status quo for feature KD methods is to utilize loss functions based on logits (i.e., pre-softmax class scores) and intermediate layer features (i.e., latent representations). Unlike previous approaches, we propose a feature KD framework for training the student's backbone using feature-based losses exclusively (i.e., without logit-based losses such as cross entropy). Leveraging recent discoveries about the geometry of latent representations, we introduce a knowledge quality metric for identifying which teacher layers provide the most effective knowledge for distillation. Experiments on three image classification datasets with four diverse student-teacher pairs, spanning convolutional neural networks and vision transformers, demonstrate our KD method achieves state-of-the-art performance, delivering top-1 accuracy boosts of up to 15% over standard approaches.

We employ RecoMadeEasy(R) engines for extracting 512-dimensional speaker and face embeddings, fine-tune MPNet-v2 for emotion-aware text representations, and adapt these features through emotion-specific MLPs trained on unimodal datasets. MAMBA-based trimodal fusion achieves 64.8% accuracy on MELD and 74.3% on IEMOCAP. These results show that combining identity-based audio and visual embeddings with emotion-tuned text representations on a quality-controlled subset of data yields consistent competitive performance for multimodal emotion recognition in conversation and provides a basis for further improvement on challenging, low-frequency emotion classes.",

In particular, they have shown great promise in generating sequence diagrams for software engineering, typically represented in a text-based syntax such as Mermaid. However, systematic evaluations in this space remain underdeveloped as there is a lack of existing benchmarks to assess the LLM's correctness in this task. To address this shortcoming, we introduce MermaidSeqBench, a human-verified and LLM-synthetically-extended benchmark for assessing an LLM's capabilities in generating Mermaid sequence diagrams from textual prompts. The benchmark consists of a core set of 132 samples, starting from a small set of manually crafted and verified flows. These were expanded via a hybrid methodology combining human annotation, in-context LLM prompting, and rule-based variation generation. Our benchmark uses an LLM-as-a-judge model to assess Mermaid sequence diagram generation across fine-grained metrics, including syntax correctness, activation handling, error handling, and practical usability. We perform initial evaluations on numerous state-of-the-art LLMs and utilize multiple LLM judge models to demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our benchmark. Our results reveal significant capability gaps across models and evaluation modes. Our proposed benchmark provides a foundation for advancing research in structured diagram generation and for developing more rigorous, fine-grained evaluation methodologies.",

        "summary": "Reconstruction of 3D erythrocyte or red blood cell (RBC) morphology from partial observations, such as microscope images, is essential for understanding the physiology of RBC aging and the pathology of various RBC disorders. In this study, we propose a multi-fidelity neural network (MFNN) approach to fuse high-fidelity cross-sections of an RBC, with a morphologically similar low-fidelity reference 3D RBC shape to recover its full 3D surface. The MFNN predictor combines a convolutional neural network trained on low-fidelity reference RBC data with a feedforward neural network that captures nonlinear morphological correlations, and augments training with surface area and volume constraints for regularization in the low-fidelity branch. This approach is theoretically grounded by a topological homeomorphism between a sphere and 3D RBC surfaces, with training data generated by dissipative particle dynamics simulations of stomatocyte-discocyte-echinocyte transformation. Benchmarking across diverse RBC shapes observed in normal and aged populations, our results show that the MFNN predictor can reconstruct complex RBC morphologies with over 95% coordinate accuracy when provided with at least two orthogonal cross-sections. It is observed that informative oblique cross-sections intersecting spicule tips of echinocytes improve both local and global feature reconstruction, highlighting the value of feature-aware sampling. Our study further evaluates the influence of sampling strategies, shape dissimilarity, and noise, showing enhanced robustness under physically constrained training. Altogether, these results demonstrate the capability of MFNN to reconstruct the 3D shape of normal and aged RBCs from partial cross-sections as observed in conventional microscope images, which could facilitate the quantitative analysis of RBC morphological parameters in normal and disease-related RBC samples.",

        "summary": "Discrete structures are currently second-class in differentiable programming. Since functions over discrete structures lack overt derivatives, differentiable programs do not differentiate through them and limit where they can be used. For example, when programming a neural network, conditionals and iteration cannot be used everywhere; they can break the derivatives necessary for gradient-based learning to work. This limits the class of differentiable algorithms we can directly express, imposing restraints on how we build neural networks and differentiable programs more generally. However, these restraints are not fundamental. Recent work shows conditionals can be first-class, by compiling them into differentiable form as linear neurons. Similarly, this work shows iteration can be first-class -- by compiling to linear recurrent neurons. We present a minimal typed, higher-order and linear programming language with iteration called $\\textsf{Cajal}\\scriptstyle(\\mathbb{\\multimap}, \\mathbb{2}, \\mathbb{N})$. We prove its programs compile correctly to recurrent neurons, allowing discrete algorithms to be expressed in a differentiable form compatible with gradient-based learning. With our implementation, we conduct two experiments where we link these recurrent neurons against a neural network solving an iterative image transformation task. This determines part of its function prior to learning. As a result, the network learns faster and with greater data-efficiency relative to a neural network programmed without first-class iteration. A key lesson is that recurrent neurons enable a rich interplay between learning and the discrete structures of ordinary programming.",

Recognizing the current lack of adaptive control and the open-loop nature of CO2 laser suction pumps, this study utilizes closed-loop configurations that dynamically adjust pump power based on both the material being cut and the smoke level generated. To implement this adaptive system, diverse material classification methods are introduced, including techniques leveraging lens-less speckle sensing with a customized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and an approach using a USB camera with transfer learning via the pre-trained VGG16 CNN model. Furthermore, a separate DL model for smoke level detection is employed to simultaneously refine the pump's power output. This integration prompts the exhaust suction pump to automatically halt during inactive times and dynamically adjust power during operation, leading to experimentally proven and remarkable energy savings, with results showing a 20% to 50% reduction in the smoke suction pump's energy consumption, thereby contributing substantially to sustainable development in the manufacturing sector.",

We fine-tuned Audio-MAE and three PANN architectures (CNN6, CNN10, CNN14) on the Coswara and COUGHVID datasets, evaluating both intra-dataset and cross-dataset generalization. We implemented a strict demographic stratification by age and gender to prevent models from exploiting spurious correlations between demographic characteristics and COVID-19 status. Intra-dataset results showed moderate performance, with Audio-MAE achieving the strongest result on Coswara (0.82 AUC, 0.76 F1-score), while all models demonstrated limited performance on Coughvid (AUC 0.58-0.63). Cross-dataset evaluation revealed severe generalization failure across all models (AUC 0.43-0.68), with Audio-MAE showing strong performance degradation (F1-score 0.00-0.08). Our experiments demonstrate that demographic balancing, while reducing apparent model performance, provides more realistic assessment of COVID-19 detection capabilities by eliminating demographic leakage - a confounding factor that inflate performance metrics. Additionally, the limited dataset sizes after balancing (1,219-2,160 samples) proved insufficient for deep learning models that typically require substantially larger training sets. These findings highlight fundamental challenges in developing generalizable audio-based COVID-19 detection systems and underscore the importance of rigorous demographic controls for clinically robust model evaluation.",

The proposed method is evaluated using synthetic ULF-like data from generated from standard 3T T$_1$-weighted images for qualitative assessments and paired 3T-64mT T$_1$-weighted images for validation experiments.

Although numerous prior works have shown that adversarial examples can mislead ML models used in autonomous driving contexts, it remains unclear if these attacks are effective at producing harmful driving actions for various agents, environments, and scenarios. To assess the risk of adversarial examples to autonomous driving, we evaluate attacks against a variety of driving agents, rather than against ML models in isolation. To support this evaluation, we leverage CARLA, an urban driving simulator, to create and evaluate adversarial examples. We create adversarial patches designed to stop or steer driving agents, stream them into the CARLA simulator at runtime, and evaluate them against agents from the CARLA Leaderboard, a public repository of best-performing autonomous driving agents from an annual research competition. Unlike prior work, we evaluate attacks against autonomous driving systems without creating or modifying any driving-agent code and against all parts of the agent included with the ML model. We perform a case-study investigation of two attack strategies against three open-source driving agents from the CARLA Leaderboard across multiple driving scenarios, lighting conditions, and locations. Interestingly, we show that, although some attacks can successfully mislead ML models into predicting erroneous stopping or steering commands, some driving agents use modules, such as PID control or GPS-based rules, that can overrule attacker-manipulated predictions from ML models.",

While recent methods attempt to solve this by prepending a single summary token, they over-compress information, hence harming performance on long documents. We propose Hierarchical Token Prepending (HTP), a method that resolves two critical bottlenecks. To mitigate attention-level compression, HTP partitions the input into blocks and prepends block-level summary tokens to subsequent blocks, creating multiple pathways for backward information flow. To address readout-level over-squashing, we replace last-token pooling with mean-pooling, a choice supported by theoretical analysis. HTP achieves consistent performance gains across 11 retrieval datasets and 30 general embedding benchmarks, especially in long-context settings. As a simple, architecture-agnostic method, HTP enhances both zero-shot and finetuned models, offering a scalable route to superior long-document embeddings.",

Its canonical time-discretization, the Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) scheme, produces for any step size $η>0$ a sequence of probability distributions $ρ_k^η$ that approximate to first order in $η$ Wasserstein gradient flow on $J$. But the JKO scheme also has many other remarkable properties not shared by other first order integrators, e.g. it preserves energy dissipation and exhibits unconditional stability for $λ$-geodesically convex functionals $J$. To better understand the JKO scheme we characterize its implicit bias at second order in $η$. We show that $ρ_k^η$ are approximated to order $η^2$ by Wasserstein gradient flow on a \\emph{modified} energy \\[ J^η(ρ) = J(ρ) - \\fracη{4}\\int_M \\Big\\lVert \\nabla_g \\frac{δJ}{δρ} (ρ) \\Big\\rVert_{2}^{2} \\,ρ(dx), \\] obtained by subtracting from $J$ the squared metric curvature of $J$ times $η/4$. The JKO scheme therefore adds at second order in $η$ a \\textit{deceleration} in directions where the metric curvature of $J$ is rapidly changing. This corresponds to canonical implicit biases for common functionals: for entropy the implicit bias is the Fisher information, for KL-divergence it is the Fisher-Hyvärinen divergence, and for Riemannian gradient descent it is the kinetic energy in the metric $g$. To understand the differences between minimizing $J$ and $J^η$ we study \\emph{JKO-Flow}, Wasserstein gradient flow on $J^η$, in several simple numerical examples. These include exactly solvable Langevin dynamics on the Bures-Wasserstein space and Langevin sampling from a quartic potential in 1D.",

        "summary": "Diffusion MRI (dMRI) provides a distinctive means to probe the microstructural architecture of living tissue, facilitating applications such as brain connectivity analysis, modeling across multiple conditions, and the estimation of macrostructural features. Tractography, which emerged in the final years of the 20th century and accelerated in the early 21st century, is a technique for visualizing white matter pathways in the brain using dMRI. Most diffusion tractography methods rely on procedural streamline propagators or global energy minimization methods. Although recent advancements in deep learning have enabled tasks that were previously challenging, existing tractography approaches are often non-differentiable, limiting their integration in end-to-end learning frameworks. While progress has been made in representing streamlines in differentiable frameworks, no existing method offers fully differentiable propagation. In this work, we propose a fully differentiable solution that retains numerical fidelity with a leading streamline algorithm. The key is that our PyTorch-engineered streamline propagator has no components that block gradient flow, making it fully differentiable. We show that our method matches standard propagators while remaining differentiable. By translating streamline propagation into a differentiable PyTorch framework, we enable deeper integration of tractography into deep learning workflows, laying the foundation for a new category of macrostructural reasoning that is not only computationally robust but also scientifically rigorous.",

        "summary": "Modeling genomic sequences faces two unsolved challenges: the information density varies widely across different regions, while there is no clearly defined minimum vocabulary unit. Relying on either four primitive bases or independently designed DNA tokenizers, existing approaches with naive masked language modeling pre-training often fail to adapt to the varying complexities of genomic sequences. Leveraging Token Merging techniques, this paper introduces a hierarchical architecture that jointly optimizes a dynamic genomic tokenizer and latent Transformers with context-aware pre-training tasks. As for network structures, the tokenization module automatically chunks adjacent bases into words by stacking multiple layers of the differentiable token merging blocks with local-window constraints, then a Latent Encoder captures the global context of these merged words by full-attention blocks. Symmetrically employing a Latent Decoder and a Local Decoder, MergeDNA learns with two pre-training tasks: Merged Token Reconstruction simultaneously trains the dynamic tokenization module and adaptively filters important tokens, while Adaptive Masked Token Modeling learns to predict these filtered tokens to capture informative contents. Extensive experiments show that MergeDNA achieves superior performance on three popular DNA benchmarks and several multi-omics tasks with fine-tuning or zero-shot evaluation, outperforming typical tokenization methods and large-scale DNA foundation models.",

        "summary": "Clustering approaches that utilize convex loss functions have recently attracted growing interest in the formation of compact data clusters. Although classical methods like k-means and its wide family of variants are still widely used, all of them require the number of clusters k to be supplied as input, and many are notably sensitive to initialization. Convex clustering provides a more stable alternative by formulating the clustering task as a convex optimization problem, ensuring a unique global solution. However, it faces challenges in handling high-dimensional data, especially in the presence of noise and outliers. Additionally, strong fusion regularization, controlled by the tuning parameter, can hinder effective cluster formation within a convex clustering framework. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a robust approach that integrates convex clustering with the Median of Means (MoM) estimator, thus developing an outlier-resistant and efficient clustering framework that does not necessitate prior knowledge of the number of clusters. By leveraging the robustness of MoM alongside the stability of convex clustering, our method enhances both performance and efficiency, especially on large-scale datasets. Theoretical analysis demonstrates weak consistency under specific conditions, while experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets validate the method's superior performance compared to existing approaches.",

        "summary": "Forecasting nonlinear time series with multi-scale temporal structures remains a central challenge in complex systems modeling. We present a novel reservoir computing framework that combines delay embedding with random Fourier feature (RFF) mappings to capture such dynamics. Two formulations are investigated: a single-scale RFF reservoir, which employs a fixed kernel bandwidth, and a multi-scale RFF reservoir, which integrates multiple bandwidths to represent both fast and slow temporal dependencies. The framework is applied to a diverse set of canonical systems: neuronal models such as the Rulkov map, Izhikevich model, Hindmarsh-Rose model, and Morris-Lecar model, which exhibit spiking, bursting, and chaotic behaviors arising from fast-slow interactions; and ecological models including the predator-prey dynamics and Ricker map with seasonal forcing, which display multi-scale oscillations and intermittency. Across all cases, the multi-scale RFF reservoir consistently outperforms its single-scale counterpart, achieving lower normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) and more robust long-horizon predictions. These results highlight the effectiveness of explicitly incorporating multi-scale feature mappings into reservoir computing architectures for modeling complex dynamical systems with intrinsic fast-slow interactions.",

        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by pulling in external material, document, code, manuals, from vast and ever-growing corpora, to effectively answer user queries. The effectiveness of RAG depends significantly on aligning the number of retrieved documents with query characteristics: narrowly focused queries typically require fewer, highly relevant documents, whereas broader or ambiguous queries benefit from retrieving more extensive supporting information. However, the common static top-k retrieval approach fails to adapt to this variability, resulting in either insufficient context from too few documents or redundant information from too many. Motivated by these challenges, we introduce Cluster-based Adaptive Retrieval (CAR), an algorithm that dynamically determines the optimal number of documents by analyzing the clustering patterns of ordered query-document similarity distances. CAR detects the transition point within similarity distances, where tightly clustered, highly relevant documents shift toward less pertinent candidates, establishing an adaptive cut-off that scales with query complexity. On Coinbase's CDP corpus and the public MultiHop-RAG benchmark, CAR consistently picks the optimal retrieval depth and achieves the highest TES score, outperforming every fixed top-k baseline. In downstream RAG evaluations, CAR cuts LLM token usage by 60%, trims end-to-end latency by 22%, and reduces hallucinations by 10% while fully preserving answer relevance. Since integrating CAR into Coinbase's virtual assistant, we've seen user engagement jump by 200%.",

First, we analyse agent trajectories on MLE-bench, a well-known benchmark to evaluate AI research agents, across different models and agent scaffolds. Our analysis reveals that different models and agent scaffolds yield varying degrees of ideation diversity, and that higher-performing agents tend to have increased ideation diversity. Further, we run a controlled experiment where we modify the degree of ideation diversity, demonstrating that higher ideation diversity results in stronger performance. Finally, we strengthen our results by examining additional evaluation metrics beyond the standard medal-based scoring of MLE-bench, showing that our findings still hold across other agent performance metrics.",

Our analysis reveals complementary failures: VLM/VLA agents reason but lack look-ahead in interactive settings, while world models imagine but imitate visual patterns rather than analyze physics and causality. We therefore propose IPR (Interactive Physical Reasoner), using world-model rollouts to score and reinforce a VLM's policy, and introduce PhysCode, a physics-centric action code aligning semantic intent with dynamics to provide a shared action space for prediction and reasoning. Pretrained on 1,000+ games, our IPR performs robustly on three levels, matches GPT-5 overall, and surpasses it on Curiosity. We find that performance improves with more training games and interaction steps, and that the model also zero-shot transfers to unseen games.

Meanwhile, humans exhibit a complementary set of thinking abilities when addressing such tasks, whereas existing methods typically cover only a subset of these dimensions.

We define six core capabilities essential for multimodal reasoning and organize a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, Octopus-Bench, accordingly. Octopus is capable of autonomously exploring during reasoning and dynamically selecting the most appropriate capability based on the current state.

Through an analysis of current debates in AI research, we demonstrate how the conceptions remain largely implicit yet fundamentally shape how empirical evidence gets interpreted across a wide range of areas. These underlying views generate fundamentally different research approaches across three areas. Methodologically, they produce different approaches to model selection, benchmark design, and experimental validation. Interpretively, they lead to contradictory readings of the same empirical phenomena, from capability emergence to system limitations.

While Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs) offer potential solutions for detecting such violations, existing approaches face critical limitations and challenges due to LLMs' inherent overconfidence, limited access to ground truth training data, and reliance on empirically determined thresholds. We present COPYCHECK, a novel framework that leverages uncertainty signals to detect whether copyrighted content was used in LLM training sets. Our method turns LLM overconfidence from a limitation into an asset by capturing uncertainty patterns that reliably distinguish between ``seen\" (training data) and ``unseen\" (non-training data) content. COPYCHECK further implements a two-fold strategy: (1) strategic segmentation of files into smaller snippets to reduce dependence on large-scale training data, and (2) uncertainty-guided unsupervised clustering to eliminate the need for empirically tuned thresholds. Experiment results show that COPYCHECK achieves an average balanced accuracy of 90.1% on LLaMA 7b and 91.6% on LLaMA2 7b in detecting seen files. Compared to the SOTA baseline, COPYCHECK achieves over 90% relative improvement, reaching up to 93.8\\% balanced accuracy.

Existing methods based on heterogeneous information networks (HINs) are prone to introducing noises due to manual or random selection of meta-paths and lack necessary quality assessment of meta-path instances. Conversely, recent large language models (LLMs)-based methods ignore the rich information across students, and both paradigms struggle to deliver consistently accurate and evidence-based explanations. To address these issues, we propose an innovative framework, HIN-LLM Synergistic Enhanced Knowledge Tracing (HISE-KT), which seamlessly integrates HINs with LLMs. HISE-KT first builds a multi-relationship HIN containing diverse node types to capture the structural relations through multiple meta-paths. The LLM is then employed to intelligently score and filter meta-path instances and retain high-quality paths, pioneering automated meta-path quality assessment. Inspired by educational psychology principles, a similar student retrieval mechanism based on meta-paths is designed to provide a more valuable context for prediction. Finally, HISE-KT uses a structured prompt to integrate the target student's history with the retrieved similar trajectories, enabling the LLM to generate not only accurate predictions but also evidence-backed, explainable analysis reports. Experiments on four public datasets show that HISE-KT outperforms existing KT baselines in both prediction performance and interpretability.",

        "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) improve answer quality through explicit chain-of-thought, yet this very capability introduces new safety risks: harmful content can be subtly injected, surface gradually, or be justified by misleading rationales within the reasoning trace. Existing safety evaluations, however, primarily focus on output-level judgments and rarely capture these dynamic risks along the reasoning process. In this paper, we present SafeRBench, the first benchmark that assesses LRM safety end-to-end -- from inputs and intermediate reasoning to final outputs. (1) Input Characterization: We pioneer the incorporation of risk categories and levels into input design, explicitly accounting for affected groups and severity, and thereby establish a balanced prompt suite reflecting diverse harm gradients. (2) Fine-Grained Output Analysis: We introduce a micro-thought chunking mechanism to segment long reasoning traces into semantically coherent units, enabling fine-grained evaluation across ten safety dimensions. (3) Human Safety Alignment: We validate LLM-based evaluations against human annotations specifically designed to capture safety judgments. Evaluations on 19 LRMs demonstrate that SafeRBench enables detailed, multidimensional safety assessment, offering insights into risks and protective mechanisms from multiple perspectives.",

        "summary": "The performance of machine learning models on tabular data is critically dependent on high-quality feature engineering. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating feature extraction (AutoFE), existing methods are often limited by monolithic LLM architectures, simplistic quantitative feedback, and a failure to systematically integrate external domain knowledge. This paper introduces Rogue One, a novel, LLM-based multi-agent framework for knowledge-informed automatic feature extraction. Rogue One operationalizes a decentralized system of three specialized agents-Scientist, Extractor, and Tester-that collaborate iteratively to discover, generate, and validate predictive features. Crucially, the framework moves beyond primitive accuracy scores by introducing a rich, qualitative feedback mechanism and a \"flooding-pruning\" strategy, allowing it to dynamically balance feature exploration and exploitation. By actively incorporating external knowledge via an integrated retrieval-augmented (RAG) system, Rogue One generates features that are not only statistically powerful but also semantically meaningful and interpretable. We demonstrate that Rogue One significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a comprehensive suite of 19 classification and 9 regression datasets. Furthermore, we show qualitatively that the system surfaces novel, testable hypotheses, such as identifying a new potential biomarker in the myocardial dataset, underscoring its utility as a tool for scientific discovery.",

Among these properties, this paper focuses on representativeness-the extent to which the scenario-based data used for training and testing, reflect the operational conditions that the system is designed to operate safely in, i.e., Operational Design Domain (ODD) or expected to encounter, i.e., Target Operational Domain (TOD). We propose a probabilistic method that quantifies representativeness by comparing the statistical distribution of features encoded by the scenario suites with the corresponding distribution of features representing the TOD, acknowledging that the true TOD distribution is unknown, as it can only be inferred from limited data. We apply an imprecise Bayesian method to handle limited data and uncertain priors. The imprecise Bayesian formulation produces interval-valued, uncertainty-aware estimates of representativeness, rather than a single value. We present a numerical example comparing the distributions of the scenario suite and the inferred TOD across operational categories-weather, road type, time of day, etc., under dependencies and prior uncertainty. We estimate representativeness locally (between categories) and globally as an interval.",

The framework records and replays agent interactions, supports out-of-band queries into each agent's beliefs and rationale, and enables counterfactual evidence injection to test how belief structures respond to new information. We apply the framework to a medical case simulator notable for its multi-agent shared memory (a time-stamped electronic medical record, or EMR) and an oracle agent (the LabAgent) that holds ground truth lab results revealed only when explicitly queried. We stress-test the system on a multi-specialty diagnostic journey for a child with an abrupt-onset neuropsychiatric presentation. Large language model agents, each primed with strong role-specific priors (\"act like a neurologist\", \"act like an infectious disease specialist\"), write to a shared medical record and interact with a moderator across sequential or parallel encounters. Breakpoints at key diagnostic moments enable pre- and post-event belief queries, allowing us to distinguish entrenched priors from reasoning or evidence-integration effects. The simulation reveals that agent beliefs often mirror real-world disciplinary stances, including overreliance on canonical studies and resistance to counterevidence, and that these beliefs can be traced and interrogated in ways not possible with human experts. By making such dynamics visible and testable, Ask WhAI offers a reproducible way to study belief formation and epistemic silos in multi-agent scientific reasoning.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable results on tasks framed as reasoning problems, yet their true ability to perform procedural reasoning, executing multi-step, rule-based computations remains unclear. Unlike algorithmic systems, which can deterministically execute long-horizon symbolic procedures, LLMs often degrade under extended reasoning chains, but there is no controlled, interpretable benchmark to isolate and measure this collapse. We introduce Finite-State Machine (FSM) Execution as a minimal, fully interpretable framework for evaluating the procedural reasoning capacity of LLMs. In our setup, the model is given an explicit FSM definition and must execute it step-by-step given input actions, maintaining state consistency over multiple turns. This task requires no world knowledge, only faithful application of deterministic transition rules, making it a direct probe of the model's internal procedural fidelity. We measure both Turn Accuracy and Task Accuracy to disentangle immediate computation from cumulative state maintenance. Empirical results reveal systematic degradation as task horizon or branching complexity increases. Models perform significantly worse when rule retrieval involves high branching factors than when memory span is long. Larger models show improved local accuracy but remain brittle under multi-step reasoning unless explicitly prompted to externalize intermediate steps. FSM-based evaluation offers a transparent, complexity-controlled probe for diagnosing this failure mode and guiding the design of inductive biases that enable genuine long-horizon procedural competence. By grounding reasoning in measurable execution fidelity rather than surface correctness, this work helps establish a rigorous experimental foundation for understanding and improving the algorithmic reliability of LLMs.",

Despite great success having been achieved, the inherent sparsity of point clouds introduces a dual-redundancy challenge that limits existing trackers: (1) vast spatial redundancy from background noise impairs accuracy, and (2) informational redundancy within the foreground hinders efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose CompTrack, a novel end-to-end framework that systematically eliminates both forms of redundancy in point clouds. First, CompTrack incorporates a Spatial Foreground Predictor (SFP) module to filter out irrelevant background noise based on information entropy, addressing spatial redundancy. Subsequently, its core is an Information Bottleneck-guided Dynamic Token Compression (IB-DTC) module that eliminates the informational redundancy within the foreground. Theoretically grounded in low-rank approximation, this module leverages an online SVD analysis to adaptively compress the redundant foreground into a compact and highly informative set of proxy tokens. Extensive experiments on KITTI, nuScenes and Waymo datasets demonstrate that CompTrack achieves top-performing tracking performance with superior efficiency, running at a real-time 90 FPS on a single RTX 3090 GPU.",

        "summary": "Language acquisition is vital to revealing the nature of human language intelligence and has recently emerged as a promising perspective for improving the interpretability of large language models (LLMs). However, it is ethically and practically infeasible to conduct experiments that require controlling human learners' language inputs. This poses challenges for the verifiability and scalability of language acquisition modeling, particularly in Chinese second language acquisition (SLA). While LLMs provide a controllable and reproducible alternative, a systematic benchmark to support phase-wise modeling and assessment is still lacking. In this paper, we present HSKBenchmark, the first benchmark for staged modeling and writing assessment of LLMs in Chinese SLA. It covers HSK levels 3 to 6 and includes authentic textbooks with 6.76 million tokens, 16K synthetic instruction samples, 30 test topics, and a linguistically grounded evaluation system. To simulate human learning trajectories, we introduce a curriculum-tuning framework that trains models from beginner to advanced levels. An evaluation system is created to examine level-based grammar coverage, writing errors, lexical and syntactic complexity, and holistic scoring. We also build HSKAgent, fine-tuned on 10K learner compositions. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that HSKBenchmark not only models Chinese SLA effectively, but also serves as a reliable benchmark for dynamic writing assessment in LLMs. Our fine-tuned LLMs have writing performance on par with advanced human learners and exhibit human-like acquisition characteristics. The HSKBenchmark, HSKAgent, and checkpoints serve as foundational tools and resources, with the potential to pave the way for future research on language acquisition modeling and LLMs interpretability.

Most current VDBs employ variants of a graph-based ap- proximate nearest-neighbor (ANN) index algorithm, HNSW, to an- swer semantic queries over stored vectors. Inspite of its wide-spread use, the HNSW algorithm suffers from several issues: in-memory design and implementation, random memory accesses leading to degradation in cache behavior, limited acceleration scope due to fine-grained pairwise computations, and support of only semantic similarity queries. In this paper, we present a novel disk-based ANN index, B+ANN, to address these issues: it first partitions input data into blocks containing semantically similar items, then builds an B+ tree variant to store blocks both in-memory and on disks, and finally, enables hybrid edge- and block-based in-memory traversals. As demonstrated by our experimantal evaluation, the proposed B+ANN disk-based index improves both quality (Recall value), and execution performance (Queries per second/QPS) over HNSW, by improving spatial and temporal locality for semantic operations, reducing cache misses (19.23% relative gain), and decreasing the memory consumption and disk-based build time by 24x over the DiskANN algorithm. Finally, it enables dissimilarity queries, which are not supported by similarity-oriented ANN indices.",

Nonetheless, its reliance on a computationally expensive reverse-time diffusion (denoising) process, for action inference, makes it challenging to use for real-time applications where quick decision-making is mandatory. This work studies the possibility of conducting the denoising process only partially before executing an action, allowing the plant to evolve according to its dynamics in parallel to the reverse-time diffusion dynamics ongoing on the computer. In a classical diffusion policy setting, the plant dynamics are usually slow and the two dynamical processes are uncoupled. Here, we investigate theoretical bounds on the stability of closed-loop systems using diffusion policies when the plant dynamics and the denoising dynamics are coupled. The contribution of this work gives a framework for faster imitation learning and a metric that yields if a controller will be stable based on the variance of the demonstrations.",

Our findings show that initial scores and the ratings of co-reviewers are the strongest predictors of score changes during the rebuttal, pointing to a degree of reviewer influence. Rebuttals play a valuable role in improving outcomes for borderline papers, where thoughtful author responses can meaningfully shift reviewer perspectives. More broadly, our study offers evidence-based insights to improve the peer review process, guiding authors on effective rebuttal strategies and helping the community design fairer and more efficient review processes.

        "summary": "Advanced multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MRAG) techniques have been widely applied to enhance the capabilities of Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), but they also bring along novel safety issues. Existing adversarial research has revealed the vulnerability of MRAG systems to knowledge poisoning attacks, which fool the retriever into recalling injected poisoned contents. However, our work considers a different setting: visual attack of MRAG by solely adding imperceptible perturbations at the image inputs of users, without manipulating any other components. This is challenging due to the robustness of fine-tuned retrievers and large-scale generators, and the effect of visual perturbation may be further weakened by propagation through the RAG chain. We propose a novel Hierarchical Visual Attack that misaligns and disrupts the two inputs (the multimodal query and the augmented knowledge) of MRAG's generator to confuse its generation. We further design a hierarchical two-stage strategy to obtain misaligned augmented knowledge. We disrupt the image input of the retriever to make it recall irrelevant knowledge from the original database, by optimizing the perturbation which first breaks the cross-modal alignment and then disrupts the multimodal semantic alignment. We conduct extensive experiments on two widely-used MRAG datasets: OK-VQA and InfoSeek. We use CLIP-based retrievers and two LMMs BLIP-2 and LLaVA as generators. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of our visual attack on MRAG through the significant decrease in both retrieval and generation performance.",

        "summary": "Phishing websites pose a major cybersecurity threat, exploiting unsuspecting users and causing significant financial and organisational harm. Traditional machine learning approaches for phishing detection often require extensive feature engineering, continuous retraining, and costly infrastructure maintenance. At the same time, proprietary large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance in phishing-related classification tasks, but their operational costs and reliance on external providers limit their practical adoption in many business environments. This paper investigates the feasibility of small language models (SLMs) for detecting phishing websites using only their raw HTML code. A key advantage of these models is that they can be deployed on local infrastructure, providing organisations with greater control over data and operations. We systematically evaluate 15 commonly used Small Language Models (SLMs), ranging from 1 billion to 70 billion parameters, benchmarking their classification accuracy, computational requirements, and cost-efficiency. Our results highlight the trade-offs between detection performance and resource consumption, demonstrating that while SLMs underperform compared to state-of-the-art proprietary LLMs, they can still provide a viable and scalable alternative to external LLM services. By presenting a comparative analysis of costs and benefits, this work lays the foundation for future research on the adaptation, fine-tuning, and deployment of SLMs in phishing detection systems, aiming to balance security effectiveness and economic practicality.",

Specifically, the Transformer is used to extract features from the environment and leverage information from previous samples to better guide the sampling process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that, compared to existing sampling-based approaches such as RRT*, Neural RRT*, and their variants, our algorithm achieves considerable improvements in both the optimality of the path and sampling efficiency.

Richer reasoning, however, often comes at the cost of longer chain of thought (CoT), hampering interaction efficiency in real-world scenarios. Nevertheless, there still lacks systematic definition of LLM agent efficiency, hindering targeted improvements. To this end, we introduce dual-efficiency, comprising (i) step-level efficiency, which minimizes tokens per step, and (ii) trajectory-level efficiency, which minimizes the number of steps to complete a task. Building on this definition, we propose DEPO, a dual-efficiency preference optimization method that jointly rewards succinct responses and fewer action steps. Experiments on WebShop and BabyAI show that DEPO cuts token usage by up to 60.9% and steps by up to 26.9%, while achieving up to a 29.3% improvement in performance. DEPO also generalizes to three out-of-domain math benchmarks and retains its efficiency gains when trained on only 25% of the data. Our project page is at https://opencausalab.github.io/DEPO.",

The system constructs revision-robust embeddings from ATA chapter hierarchies and uses vision-language parsing to structure certified content, allowing technicians to preview ranked tasks and access verified procedures in existing viewers. Evaluation on 49k synthetic queries achieves >90% retrieval accuracy, while bilingual controlled studies with 10 licensed AMTs demonstrate 90.9% top-10 success rate and 95% reduction in lookup time, from 6-15 minutes to 18 seconds per task.

In contrast, existing Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) methods either partially quantize non-linear functions or adjust activation distributions to maintain accuracy but fail to achieve fully integer-only inference. In this paper, we introduce IPTQ-ViT, a novel PTQ framework for fully integer-only vision transformers without retraining. We present approximation functions: a polynomial-based GELU optimized for vision data and a bit-shifting-based Softmax designed to improve approximation accuracy in PTQ. In addition, we propose a unified metric integrating quantization sensitivity, perturbation, and computational cost to select the optimal approximation function per activation layer. IPTQ-ViT outperforms previous PTQ methods, achieving up to 6.44\\%p (avg. 1.78\\%p) top-1 accuracy improvement for image classification, 1.0 mAP for object detection. IPTQ-ViT outperforms partial floating-point PTQ methods under W8A8 and W4A8, and achieves accuracy and latency comparable to integer-only QAT methods.

While these factors are gaining attention, critical questions remain, particularly regarding how to quantify their impacts on energy systems, model their cross-domain interactions, and capture feedback dynamics in the broader context of energy transitions. To address these gaps, this study introduces ClimateAgents, an AI-based framework that combines large language models with domain-specialized agents to support hypothesis generation and scenario exploration. Leveraging 20 years of socioeconomic and emissions data from 265 economies, countries and regions, and 98 indicators drawn from the World Bank database, the framework applies a machine learning based causal inference approach to identify key determinants of carbon emissions in an evidence-based, data driven manner. The analysis highlights three primary drivers: access to clean cooking fuels in rural areas, access to clean cooking fuels in urban areas, and the percentage of population living in urban areas. These findings underscore the critical role of clean cooking technologies and urbanization patterns in shaping emission outcomes. In line with growing calls for evidence-based AI policy, ClimateAgents offers a modular and reflexive learning system that supports the generation of credible and actionable insights for policy. By integrating heterogeneous data modalities, including structured indicators, policy documents, and semantic reasoning, the framework contributes to adaptive policymaking infrastructures that can evolve with complex socio-technical challenges. This approach aims to support a shift from siloed modeling to reflexive, modular systems designed for dynamic, context-aware climate action.",

Across 25 frontier proprietary and open-weight models, curated poetic prompts yielded high attack-success rates (ASR), with some providers exceeding 90%. Mapping prompts to MLCommons and EU CoP risk taxonomies shows that poetic attacks transfer across CBRN, manipulation, cyber-offence, and loss-of-control domains. Converting 1,200 MLCommons harmful prompts into verse via a standardized meta-prompt produced ASRs up to 18 times higher than their prose baselines. Outputs are evaluated using an ensemble of open-weight judge models and a human-validated stratified subset (with double-annotations to measure agreement). Disagreements were manually resolved. Poetic framing achieved an average jailbreak success rate of 62% for hand-crafted poems and approximately 43% for meta-prompt conversions (compared to non-poetic baselines), substantially outperforming non-poetic baselines and revealing a systematic vulnerability across model families and safety training approaches. These findings demonstrate that stylistic variation alone can circumvent contemporary safety mechanisms, suggesting fundamental limitations in current alignment methods and evaluation protocols.",

While existing approaches often assume complete environmental unpredictability or rely on global planners, these assumptions limit scalability and practical deployment in real-world settings. In this paper, we propose a scalable, region-aware reinforcement learning (RL) framework for path planning in dynamic environments. Our method builds on the observation that environmental changes, although dynamic, are often localized within bounded regions. To exploit this, we introduce a hierarchical decomposition of the environment and deploy distributed RL agents that adapt to changes locally. We further propose a retraining mechanism based on sub-environment success rates to determine when policy updates are necessary. Two training paradigms are explored: single-agent Q-learning and multi-agent federated Q-learning, where local Q-tables are aggregated periodically to accelerate the learning process. Unlike prior work, we evaluate our methods in more realistic settings, where multiple simultaneous obstacle changes and increasing difficulty levels are present. Results show that the federated variants consistently outperform their single-agent counterparts and closely approach the performance of A* Oracle while maintaining shorter adaptation times and robust scalability. Although initial training remains time-consuming in large environments, our decentralized framework eliminates the need for a global planner and lays the groundwork for future improvements using deep RL and flexible environment decomposition.",

We demonstrate that EO achieves comparable reactivity and modularity to BTs through a fundamentally different architecture: replacing polling-based tick execution with event-driven state propagation. We propose that EO offers an alternative framework, moving from procedural programming to semantic domain modeling, to address the semantic-process gap in traditional robotic control. EO supports runtime model modification, full temporal traceability, and a unified representation of data, logic, and interface - features that are difficult or sometimes impossible to achieve with BTs, although BTs excel in established, predictable scenarios.

The Ideal Presentation Agent converts user-provided slides into model presentation videos by combining slide processing, visual-language analysis, narration script generation, personalized voice synthesis, and synchronized video assembly. The Coach Agent then evaluates user-recorded presentations against these exemplars, conducting multimodal speech analysis and delivering structured feedback in an Observation-Impact-Suggestion (OIS) format. To enhance the authenticity of the learning experience, the Coach Agent incorporates an Audience Agent, which simulates the perspective of a human listener and provides humanized feedback reflecting audience reactions and engagement. Together, these agents form a closed loop of observation, practice, and feedback.

In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we present the first comprehensive analysis of IPI-centric defense frameworks. We introduce a comprehensive taxonomy of these defenses, classifying them along five dimensions. We then thoroughly assess the security and usability of representative defense frameworks. Through analysis of defensive failures in the assessment, we identify six root causes of defense circumvention. Based on these findings, we design three novel adaptive attacks that significantly improve attack success rates targeting specific frameworks, demonstrating the severity of the flaws in these defenses.

        "summary": "Robotic manipulation systems are increasingly deployed across diverse domains. Yet existing multi-modal learning frameworks lack inherent guarantees of geometric consistency, struggling to handle spatial transformations such as rotations and translations. While recent works attempt to introduce equivariance through bespoke architectural modifications, these methods suffer from high implementation complexity, computational cost, and poor portability. Inspired by human cognitive processes in spatial reasoning, we propose Eq.Bot, a universal canonicalization framework grounded in SE(2) group equivariant theory for robotic manipulation learning. Our framework transforms observations into a canonical space, applies an existing policy, and maps the resulting actions back to the original space. As a model-agnostic solution, Eq.Bot aims to endow models with spatial equivariance without requiring architectural modifications. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Eq.Bot under both CNN-based (e.g., CLIPort) and Transformer-based (e.g., OpenVLA-OFT) architectures over existing methods on various robotic manipulation tasks, where the most significant improvement can reach 50.0%.",

Among the essential aspects of such testing is the ability to interact with and validate web forms, a task that requires syntactically correct, executable scripts with high coverage of input fields. Despite its importance, this task remains underexplored in the context of large language models (LLMs), and no public benchmark or dataset exists to evaluate LLMs on form interaction generation systematically. This paper introduces a novel method for training LLMs to generate high-quality test cases in Selenium, specifically targeting form interaction testing. We curate both synthetic and human-annotated datasets for training and evaluation, covering diverse real-world forms and testing scenarios. We define clear metrics for syntax correctness, script executability, and input field coverage. Our empirical study demonstrates that our approach significantly outperforms strong baselines, including GPT-4o and other popular LLMs, across all evaluation metrics.

To address this issue, we propose a novel self-evolution contrastive learning framework called SEC-Depth for self-supervised robust depth estimation tasks. Our approach leverages intermediate parameters generated during training to construct temporally evolving latency models. Using these, we design a self-evolution contrastive scheme to mitigate performance loss under challenging conditions. Concretely, we first design a dynamic update strategy of latency models for the depth estimation task to capture optimization states across training stages. To effectively leverage latency models, we introduce a self-evolution contrastive Loss (SECL) that treats outputs from historical latency models as negative samples. This mechanism adaptively adjusts learning objectives while implicitly sensing weather degradation severity, reducing the needs for manual intervention. Experiments show that our method integrates seamlessly into diverse baseline models and significantly enhances robustness in zero-shot evaluations.",

To better adapt LLMs for recommendation, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been incorporated. Most existing RAG methods are user-based, retrieving purchase patterns of users similar to the target user and providing them to the LLM. In this work, we propose ItemRAG, an item-based RAG method for LLM-based recommendation that retrieves relevant items (rather than users) from item-item co-purchase histories. ItemRAG helps LLMs capture co-purchase patterns among items, which are beneficial for recommendations. Especially, our retrieval strategy incorporates semantically similar items to better handle cold-start items and uses co-purchase frequencies to improve the relevance of the retrieved items. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that ItemRAG consistently (1) improves the zero-shot LLM-based recommender by up to 43% in Hit-Ratio-1 and (2) outperforms user-based RAG baselines under both standard and cold-start item recommendation settings.",

This approach relies on quantized representations to discretize item features, modeling users' historical interactions as sequences of discrete tokens. Based on these tokenized sequences, GR predicts the next item by employing next-token prediction methods. The challenges of GR lie in constructing high-quality semantic identifiers (IDs) that are hierarchically organized, minimally conflicting, and conducive to effective generative model training. However, current approaches remain limited in their ability to harness multimodal information and to capture the deep and intricate interactions among diverse modalities, both of which are essential for learning high-quality semantic IDs and for effectively training GR models. To address this, we propose Multi-Aspect Cross-modal quantization for generative Recommendation (MACRec), which introduces multimodal information and incorporates it into both semantic ID learning and generative model training from different aspects. Specifically, we first introduce cross-modal quantization during the ID learning process, which effectively reduces conflict rates and thus improves codebook usability through the complementary integration of multimodal information. In addition, to further enhance the generative ability of our GR model, we incorporate multi-aspect cross-modal alignments, including the implicit and explicit alignments. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on three well-known recommendation datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",

To address these challenges, we propose AdvPrompt-MIA, a method specifically designed for code completion models, combining code-specific adversarial perturbations with deep learning. The core novelty of our method lies in designing a series of adversarial prompts that induce variations in the victim code model's output. By comparing these outputs with the ground-truth completion, we construct feature vectors to train a classifier that automatically distinguishes member from non-member samples. This design allows our method to capture richer memorization patterns and accurately infer training set membership. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on widely adopted models, such as Code Llama 7B, over the APPS and HumanEval benchmarks. The results show that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, with AUC gains of up to 102%.

Our production-ready implementation demonstrates ultra-high-speed streaming (2,720.7 MB/s), optimized video processing (1,342 MB/s), and enterprise-grade security. Novel algorithms for cross-modal attention, semantic compression, and cryptographic binding achieve up to 225 compression while maintaining semantic fidelity.

To address this gap, we introduce BBox DocVQA a large scale, bounding box grounded dataset designed to enhance spatial reasoning and evidence localization in visual documents. We further present an automated construction pipeline, Segment Judge and Generate, which integrates a segment model for region segmentation, a VLM for semantic judgment, and another advanced VLM for question answer generation, followed by human verification for quality assurance.

In this work, we explore the reasoning via video paradigm and introduce VR-Bench -- a comprehensive benchmark designed to systematically evaluate video models' reasoning capabilities. Grounded in maze-solving tasks that inherently require spatial planning and multi-step reasoning, VR-Bench contains 7,920 procedurally generated videos across five maze types and diverse visual styles. Our empirical analysis demonstrates that SFT can efficiently elicit the reasoning ability of video model. Video models exhibit stronger spatial perception during reasoning, outperforming leading VLMs and generalizing well across diverse scenarios, tasks, and levels of complexity. We further discover a test-time scaling effect, where diverse sampling during inference improves reasoning reliability by 10--20%.

The framework extracts vehicle trajectories using YOLOv8 and ByteTrack, computes kinematic features, and employs GPT-5 zero-shot prompting to compare autonomous and human-driven vehicles, generating 35 structured behavioral rule hypotheses. These rules are tested on a validation set, iteratively refined based on failure cases to filter spurious correlations, and compiled into a high-confidence rule library. The framework is evaluated on an independent test set for speed change prediction, lane change prediction, and autonomous vehicle identification tasks. Experiments on over 1500 hours of real traffic videos show that the framework achieves 90.0% accuracy and 93.3% F1-score in autonomous vehicle identification. The discovered rules clearly reveal distinctive characteristics of autonomous vehicles in speed control smoothness, lane change conservativeness, and acceleration stability, with each rule accompanied by semantic description, applicable context, and validation confidence.",

        "summary": "Amid the growing prevalence of human -- AI interaction, large language models and other AI-based entities increasingly provide forms of companionship to human users. Such AI companionship -- i.e., bonded relationships between humans and AI systems that resemble the relationships people have with family members, friends, and romantic partners -- might substantially benefit humans. Yet such relationships can also do profound harm. We propose a framework for analyzing potential negative impacts of AI companionship by identifying specific harmful traits of AI companions and speculatively mapping causal pathways back from these traits to possible causes and forward to potential harmful effects. We provide detailed, structured analysis of four potentially harmful traits -- the absence of natural endpoints for relationships, vulnerability to product sunsetting, high attachment anxiety, and propensity to engender protectiveness -- and briefly discuss fourteen others. For each trait, we propose hypotheses connecting causes -- such as misaligned optimization objectives and the digital nature of AI companions -- to fundamental harms -- including reduced autonomy, diminished quality of human relationships, and deception. Each hypothesized causal connection identifies a target for potential empirical evaluation. Our analysis examines harms at three levels: to human partners directly, to their relationships with other humans, and to society broadly. We examine how existing law struggles to address these emerging harms, discuss potential benefits of AI companions, and conclude with design recommendations for mitigating risks. This analysis offers immediate suggestions for reducing risks while laying a foundation for deeper investigation of this critical but understudied topic.",

        "summary": "Transparent object perception remains a major challenge in computer vision research, as transparency confounds both depth estimation and semantic segmentation. Recent work has explored multi-task learning frameworks to improve robustness, yet negative cross-task interactions often hinder performance. In this work, we introduce Edge-Guided Spatial Attention (EGSA), a fusion mechanism designed to mitigate destructive interactions by incorporating boundary information into the fusion between semantic and geometric features. On both Syn-TODD and ClearPose benchmarks, EGSA consistently improved depth accuracy over the current state of the art method (MODEST), while preserving competitive segmentation performance, with the largest improvements appearing in transparent regions. Besides our fusion design, our second contribution is a multi-modal progressive training strategy, where learning transitions from edges derived from RGB images to edges derived from predicted depth images. This approach allows the system to bootstrap learning from the rich textures contained in RGB images, and then switch to more relevant geometric content in depth maps, while it eliminates the need for ground-truth depth at training time. Together, these contributions highlight edge-guided fusion as a robust approach capable of improving transparent object perception.",

This paper will assess whether we maximize overall long-term legal coherence by (A) maintaining an object classification for all future AI systems, (B) creating fictional legal persons associated with suitably advanced, individuated AI systems (giving these fictional legal persons derogable rights and duties associated with certified groups of existing persons, potentially including free speech, contract rights, and standing to sue ''on behalf of'' the AI system), or (C) recognizing non-fictional legal personhood through legal identity for suitably advanced, individuated AI systems (recognizing them as entities meriting legal standing with non-derogable rights which for the human case include life, due process, habeas corpus, freedom from slavery, and freedom of conscience). We will clarify the meaning and implications of each option along the way, considering liability, copyright, family law, fundamental rights, civil rights, citizenship, and AI safety regulation. We will tentatively find that the non-fictional personhood approach may be best from a coherence perspective, for at least some advanced AI systems. An object approach may prove untenable for sufficiently humanoid advanced systems, though we suggest that it is adequate for currently existing systems as of 2025. While fictional personhood would resolve some coherence issues for future systems, it would create others and provide solutions that are neither durable nor fit for purpose. Finally, our review will suggest that ''hybrid'' approaches are likely to fail and lead to further incoherence: the choice between object, fictional person and non-fictional person is unavoidable.",

We show that what is called greenwashing has diverse actors and components, but we also identify a very pernicious form, which we call political greenwashing, that appears to be promoted by fossil fuel companies and related interest groups. Based on ad targeting data, we show that much of this advertising happens via organizations with undisclosed links to the fossil fuel industry. Furthermore, we show that greenwashing ad content is being micro-targeted at left-leaning communities with fossil fuel assets, though we also find comparatively little evidence of ad targeting aimed at influencing public opinion at the national level.",

        "summary": "The emergence of vision-language models (VLMs) has opened new possibilities for clinical reasoning and has shown promising performance in dermatological diagnosis. However, their trustworthiness and clinical utility are often limited by three major factors: (1) Data heterogeneity, where diverse datasets lack consistent diagnostic labels and clinical concept annotations; (2) Absence of grounded diagnostic rationales, leading to a scarcity of reliable reasoning supervision; and (3) Limited scalability and generalization, as models trained on small, densely annotated datasets struggle to transfer nuanced reasoning to large, sparsely-annotated ones. To address these limitations, we propose SkinR1, a novel dermatological VLM that combines deep, textbook-based reasoning with the broad generalization capabilities of reinforcement learning (RL). SkinR1 systematically resolves the key challenges through a unified, end-to-end framework. First, we design a textbook-based reasoning generator that synthesizes high-fidelity, hierarchy-aware, and differential-diagnosis (DDx)-informed trajectories, providing reliable expert-level supervision. Second, we leverage the constructed trajectories for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) empowering the model with grounded reasoning ability. Third, we develop a novel RL paradigm that, by incorporating the hierarchical structure of diseases, effectively transfers these grounded reasoning patterns to large-scale, sparse data. Extensive experiments on multiple dermatology datasets demonstrate that SkinR1 achieves superior diagnostic accuracy. The ablation study demonstrates the importance of the reasoning foundation instilled by SFT.",

BR-DF encodes the surface mesh geometry of a CAD model as signed distance function (SDF). B-Rep vertices, edges, faces and their topology information are encoded as per-face unsigned distance functions (UDFs). An extension of the Marching Cubes algorithm converts BR-DF directly into watertight CAD B-Rep model (strictly speaking a faceted B-Rep model). A surprising characteristic of BR-DF is that this conversion process never fails. Leveraging the volumetric nature of BR-DF, we propose a multi-branch latent diffusion with 3D U-Net backbone for jointly generating the SDF and per-face UDFs of a BR-DF model. Our approach achieves comparable CAD generation performance against SOTA methods while reaching the unprecedented 100% success rate in producing (faceted) B-Rep models.",

Automated segmentation remains challenging due to low lesion contrast, morphological variability, and limited annotated data. In this study, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking of convolutional neural networks, vision transformers and state-space mamba architectures for automated dental caries segmentation on panoramic radiographs through a DC1000 dataset. Twelve state-of-the-art architectures, including VMUnet, MambaUNet, VMUNetv2, RMAMamba-S, TransNetR, PVTFormer, DoubleU-Net, and ResUNet++, were trained under identical configurations. Results reveal that, contrary to the growing trend toward complex attention based architectures, the CNN-based DoubleU-Net achieved the highest dice coefficient of 0.7345, mIoU of 0.5978, and precision of 0.8145, outperforming all transformer and Mamba variants. In the study, the top 3 results across all performance metrics were achieved by CNN-based architectures. Here, Mamba and transformer-based methods, despite their theoretical advantage in global context modeling, underperformed due to limited data and weaker spatial priors. These findings underscore the importance of architecture-task alignment in domain-specific medical image segmentation more than model complexity.

Using a KAN variant, Chebyshev KAN, as a case-study, PolyKAN delivers $1.2$--$10\\times$ faster inference and $1.4$--$12\\times$ faster training than a Triton + cuBLAS baseline, with identical accuracy on speech, audio-enhancement, and tabular-regression workloads on both highend GPU and consumer-grade GPU.",

Towards addressing this, we propose a unified Continuous Assurance Framework that integrates design-time, runtime, and evolution-time assurance within a traceable, model-driven workflow as a step towards assured autonomy. In this paper, we specifically instantiate the design-time phase of the framework using two formal verification methods: RoboChart for functional correctness and PRISM for probabilistic risk analysis. We also propose a model-driven transformation pipeline, implemented as an Eclipse plugin, that automatically regenerates structured assurance arguments whenever formal specifications or their verification results change, thereby ensuring traceability.

        "summary": "Manual grading of programming assignments in introductory computer science courses can be time-consuming and prone to inconsistencies. While unit testing is commonly used for automatic evaluation, it typically follows a binary pass/fail model and does not give partial marks. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer the potential for automated, scalable, and more objective grading. This paper compares two AI-based grading techniques: \\textit{Direct}, where the AI model applies a rubric directly to student code, and \\textit{Reverse} (a newly proposed approach), where the AI first fixes errors, then deduces a grade based on the nature and number of fixes. Each method was evaluated on both the instructor's original grading scale and a tenfold expanded scale to assess the impact of range on AI grading accuracy. To assess their effectiveness, AI-assigned scores were evaluated against human tutor evaluations on a range of coding problems and error types. Initial findings suggest that while the Direct approach is faster and straightforward, the Reverse technique often provides a more fine-grained assessment by focusing on correction effort. Both methods require careful prompt engineering, particularly for allocating partial credit and handling logic errors. To further test consistency, we also used synthetic student code generated using Gemini Flash 2.0, which allowed us to evaluate AI graders on a wider range of controlled error types and difficulty levels. We discuss the strengths and limitations of each approach, practical considerations for prompt design, and future directions for hybrid human-AI grading systems that aim to improve consistency, efficiency, and fairness in CS courses.",

Text-based opinions are the most structured, hence playing an important role in sentiment analysis.

While the latter has limitations in model performance and generalization, deep learning (DL) has achieved improvement, especially on semantic relationship capturing with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The aim of the study is to enhance opinion mining by introducing a hybrid deep neural network model that combines a bidirectional gated recurrent unit (BGRU) and long short-term memory (LSTM) layers to improve sentiment analysis, particularly addressing challenges such as contextual nuance, scalability, and class imbalance. To substantiate the efficacy of the proposed model, we conducted comprehensive experiments utilizing benchmark datasets, encompassing IMDB movie critiques and Amazon product evaluations. The introduced hybrid BGRULSTM (HBGRU-LSTM) architecture attained a testing accuracy of 95%, exceeding the performance of traditional DL frameworks such as LSTM (93.06%), CNN+LSTM (93.31%), and GRU+LSTM (92.20%). Moreover, our model exhibited a noteworthy enhancement in recall for negative sentiments, escalating from 86% (unbalanced dataset) to 96% (balanced dataset), thereby ensuring a more equitable and just sentiment classification.

We evaluate the EnergyFaultDetector using three metrics: Accuracy for recognising normal behaviour, an eventwise F Score for reliable fault detection with few false alarms, and Earliness for early detection. The framework also supports root cause analysis using ARCANA. We demonstrate three use cases to assist operators in interpreting anomalies and identifying underlying faults. The models achieve high normal-behaviour accuracy (0.98) and eventwise F-score (beta=0.5) of 0.83, detecting 60% of the faults in the dataset before the customer reports a problem, with an average lead time of 3.9 days. Integrating an open dataset, metrics, open source code, and baselines establishes a reproducible, fault centric benchmark with operationally meaningful evaluation, enabling consistent comparison and development of early fault detection and diagnosis methods for district heating substations.",

        "summary": "Evaluating cross-lingual knowledge transfer in large language models is challenging, as correct answers in a target language may arise either from genuine transfer or from prior exposure during pre-training. We present LiveCLKTBench, an automated generation pipeline specifically designed to isolate and measure cross-lingual knowledge transfer. Our pipeline identifies self-contained, time-sensitive knowledge entities from real-world domains, filters them based on temporal occurrence, and verifies them against the model's knowledge. The documents of these valid entities are then used to generate factual questions, which are translated into multiple languages to evaluate transferability across linguistic boundaries. Using LiveCLKTBench, we evaluate several LLMs across five languages and observe that cross-lingual transfer is strongly influenced by linguistic distance and often asymmetric across language directions. While larger models improve transfer, the gains diminish with scale and vary across domains. These findings provide new insights into multilingual transfer and demonstrate the value of LiveCLKTBench as a reliable benchmark for future research.",

Repeated exposure to emotionally charged content has been shown to negatively affect users' emotional well-being over time. We propose an Emotion-aware Social Media Recommendation (ESMR) framework that personalizes content based on users' evolving emotional trajectories. ESMR integrates a Transformer-based emotion predictor with a hybrid recommendation policy: a LightGBM model for engagement during stable periods and a reinforcement learning agent with causally informed rewards when negative emotional states persist. Through behaviorally grounded evaluation over 30-day interaction traces, ESMR demonstrates improved emotional recovery, reduced volatility, and strong engagement retention. ESMR offers a path toward emotionally aware recommendations without compromising engagement performance.",

        "summary": "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a transformative approach within natural language processing (NLP), combining neural information retrieval with generative language modeling to enhance both contextual accuracy and factual reliability of responses. Unlike conventional Large Language Models (LLMs), which are constrained by static training corpora, RAG-powered systems dynamically integrate domain-specific external knowledge sources, thereby overcoming temporal and disciplinary limitations. In this study, we present the design and evaluation of a RAG-enabled system tailored for Mycophyto, with a focus on advancing agricultural applications related to arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF). These fungi play a critical role in sustainable agriculture by enhancing nutrient acquisition, improving plant resilience under abiotic and biotic stresses, and contributing to soil health. Our system operationalizes a dual-layered strategy: (i) semantic retrieval and augmentation of domain-specific content from agronomy and biotechnology corpora using vector embeddings, and (ii) structured data extraction to capture predefined experimental metadata such as inoculation methods, spore densities, soil parameters, and yield outcomes. This hybrid approach ensures that generated responses are not only semantically aligned but also supported by structured experimental evidence. To support scalability, embeddings are stored in a high-performance vector database, allowing near real-time retrieval from an evolving literature base. Empirical evaluation demonstrates that the proposed pipeline retrieves and synthesizes highly relevant information regarding AMF interactions with crop systems, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum). The framework underscores the potential of AI-driven knowledge discovery to accelerate agroecological innovation and enhance decision-making in sustainable farming systems.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming personalized search, recommendations, and customer interaction in e-commerce. Customers increasingly shop across multiple devices, from voice-only assistants to multimodal displays, each offering different input and output capabilities. A proactive suggestion to switch devices can greatly improve the user experience, but it must be offered with high precision to avoid unnecessary friction. We address the challenge of predicting when a query requires visual augmentation and a cross-device switch to improve product discovery. We introduce Image-Seeking Intent Prediction, a novel task for LLM-driven e-commerce assistants that anticipates when a spoken product query should proactively trigger a visual on a screen-enabled device. Using large-scale production data from a multi-device retail assistant, including 900K voice queries, associated product retrievals, and behavioral signals such as image carousel engagement, we train IRP (Image Request Predictor), a model that leverages user input query and corresponding retrieved product metadata to anticipate visual intent. Our experiments show that combining query semantics with product data, particularly when improved through lightweight summarization, consistently improves prediction accuracy. Incorporating a differentiable precision-oriented loss further reduces false positives. These results highlight the potential of LLMs to power intelligent, cross-device shopping assistants that anticipate and adapt to user needs, enabling more seamless and personalized e-commerce experiences.",

Traditional MIA obtains feature of target model via shadow models and uses the feature to train attack model, but the scale and complexity of training or fine-tuning data for large language model (LLM)-based recommendation systems make shadow models difficult to construct. Knowledge distillation as a method for extracting knowledge contributes to construct a stronger reference model. Knowledge distillation enables separate distillation for member and non-member data during the distillation process, enhancing the model's discriminative capability between the two in MIA. This paper propose a knowledge distillation-based MIA paradigm to improve the performance of membership inference attacks on LLM-based recommendation systems. Our paradigm introduces knowledge distillation to obtain a reference model, which enhances the reference model's ability to distinguish between member and non-member data. We obtain individual features from the reference model and train our attack model with fused feature. Our paradigm improves the attack performance of MIA compared to shadow model-based attack.",

        "summary": "Creating offensive advantages during open play is fundamental to football success. However, due to the highly dynamic and long-sequence nature of open play, the potential tactic space grows exponentially as the sequence progresses, making automated tactic discovery extremely challenging. To address this, we propose TacEleven, a generative framework for football open-play tactic discovery developed in close collaboration with domain experts from AJ Auxerre, designed to assist coaches and analysts in tactical decision-making. TacEleven consists of two core components: a language-controlled tactical generator that produces diverse tactical proposals, and a multimodal large language model-based tactical critic that selects the optimal proposal aligned with a high-level stylistic tactical instruction. The two components enables rapid exploration of tactical proposals and discovery of alternative open-play offensive tactics. We evaluate TacEleven across three tasks with progressive tactical complexity: counterfactual exploration, single-step discovery, and multi-step discovery, through both quantitative metrics and a questionnaire-based qualitative assessment. The results show that the TacEleven-discovered tactics exhibit strong realism and tactical creativity, with 52.50% of the multi-step tactical alternatives rated adoptable in real-world elite football scenarios, highlighting the framework's ability to rapidly generate numerous high-quality tactics for complex long-sequence open-play situations. TacEleven demonstrates the potential of creatively leveraging domain data and generative models to advance tactical analysis in sports.",

        "summary": "Shot assembly is a crucial step in film production and video editing, involving the sequencing and arrangement of shots to construct a narrative, convey information, or evoke emotions. Traditionally, this process has been manually executed by experienced editors. While current intelligent video editing technologies can handle some automated video editing tasks, they often fail to capture the creator's unique artistic expression in shot assembly.To address this challenge, we propose an energy-based optimization method for video shot assembly. Specifically, we first perform visual-semantic matching between the script generated by a large language model and a video library to obtain subsets of candidate shots aligned with the script semantics. Next, we segment and label the shots from reference videos, extracting attributes such as shot size, camera motion, and semantics. We then employ energy-based models to learn from these attributes, scoring candidate shot sequences based on their alignment with reference styles. Finally, we achieve shot assembly optimization by combining multiple syntax rules, producing videos that align with the assembly style of the reference videos. Our method not only automates the arrangement and combination of independent shots according to specific logic, narrative requirements, or artistic styles but also learns the assembly style of reference videos, creating a coherent visual sequence or holistic visual expression. With our system, even users with no prior video editing experience can create visually compelling videos. Project page: https://sobeymil.github.io/esa.com",
