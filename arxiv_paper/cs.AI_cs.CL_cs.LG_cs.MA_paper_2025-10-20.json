We focus on the case of 5 agents, and find a tight bound for the PCD strategyproof mechanism, which selects the reported location of an agent in proportion to the length of the arc in front of it. We methodically \"reduce\" the size of the instance space and then use standard optimization techniques to find and prove the bound is tight. Moreover we hypothesize the approximation ratio of PCD for general odd $n$.",

        "summary": "Recently, a very simple new bilateral negotiation strategy called MiCRO was introduced that does not make use of any kind of opponent modeling or machine learning techniques and that does not require fine-tuning of any parameters. Despite its simplicity, it was shown that MiCRO performs similar to -- or even better than -- most state-of-the-art negotiation strategies. This lead its authors to argue that the benchmark domains on which negotiation algorithms are typically tested may be too simplistic. However, one question that was left open, was how MiCRO could be generalized to multilateral negotiations. In this paper we fill this gap by introducing a multilateral variant of MiCRO. We compare it with the winners of the Automated Negotiating Agents Competitions (ANAC) of 2015, 2017 and 2018 and show that it outperforms them. Furthermore, we perform an empirical game-theoretical analysis to show that our new version of MiCRO forms an empirical Nash equilibrium.",

Addressing this need, this manuscript presents ReclAIm, a multi-agent framework capable of autonomously monitoring, evaluating, and fine-tuning medical image classification models. The system, built on a large language model core, operates entirely through natural language interaction, eliminating the need for programming expertise. ReclAIm successfully trains, evaluates, and maintains consistent performance of models across MRI, CT, and X-ray datasets. Once ReclAIm detects significant performance degradation, it autonomously executes state-of-the-art fine-tuning procedures that substantially reduce the performance gap. In cases with performance drops of up to -41.1% (MRI InceptionV3), ReclAIm managed to readjust performance metrics within 1.5% of the initial model results. ReclAIm enables automated, continuous maintenance of medical imaging AI models in a user-friendly and adaptable manner that facilitates broader adoption in both research and clinical environments.",

        "summary": "We present Lark, a biologically inspired decision-making framework that couples LLM-driven reasoning with an evolutionary, stakeholder-aware Multi-Agent System (MAS). To address verbosity and stakeholder trade-offs, we integrate four mechanisms: (i) plasticity, which applies concise adjustments to candidate solutions; (ii) duplication and maturation, which copy high-performing candidates and specialize them into new modules; (iii) ranked-choice stakeholder aggregation using influence-weighted Borda scoring; and (iv) compute awareness via token-based penalties that reward brevity. The system iteratively proposes diverse strategies, applies plasticity tweaks, simulates stakeholder evaluations, aggregates preferences, selects top candidates, and performs duplication/maturation while factoring compute cost into final scores. In a controlled evaluation over 30 rounds comparing 14 systems, Lark Full achieves a mean rank of 2.55 (95% CI [2.17, 2.93]) and a mean composite score of 29.4/50 (95% CI [26.34, 32.46]), finishing Top-3 in 80% of rounds while remaining cost competitive with leading commercial models ($0.016 per task). Paired Wilcoxon tests confirm that all four mechanisms contribute significantly as ablating duplication/maturation yields the largest deficit ({\\Delta}Score = 3.5, Cohen's d_z = 2.53, p < 0.001), followed by plasticity ({\\Delta}Score = 3.4, d_z = 1.86), ranked-choice voting ({\\Delta}Score = 2.4, d_z = 1.20), and token penalties ({\\Delta}Score = 2.2, d_z = 1.63). Rather than a formal Markov Decision Process with constrained optimization, Lark is a practical, compute-aware neuroevolutionary loop that scales stakeholder-aligned strategy generation and makes trade-offs transparent through per-step metrics. Our work presents proof-of-concept findings and invites community feedback as we expand toward real-world validation studies.",

        "summary": "Prompt optimization has emerged as an effective alternative to retraining for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, most existing approaches treat evaluation as a black box, relying solely on numerical scores while offering limited insight into why a prompt succeeds or fails. They also depend heavily on trial-and-error refinements, which are difficult to interpret and control. In this paper, we introduce MA-SAPO, a Multi-Agent framework for Score-Aware Prompt Optimization. Compared to prior methods, MA-SAPO explicitly couples evaluation outcomes with structured reasoning to guide systematic edits. The framework specifically consists of two stages: during the Reasoning Phase, agents collaboratively explain metric scores, diagnose weaknesses, and synthesize targeted refinements that are stored as reusable reasoning assets; during the Test Phase, agents retrieve these assets to analyze optimized prompts and apply only evidence-grounded edits. By turning evaluation signals into interpretable reasoning chains, MA-SAPO produces prompt refinements that are more transparent, auditable, and controllable. Experiments on the HelpSteer1/2 benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements over single-pass prompting, retrieval-augmented baselines, and prior multi-agent strategies, validating the effectiveness of our approach.",

We study a multi-agent task assignment problem where a central planner assigns recurring tasks to multiple members of a team over a finite time horizon. For any given task, the members have heterogeneous capabilities in terms of task completion times, task resource consumption (which can model variables such as energy or attention), and preferences in terms of the rewards they collect upon task completion. We assume that the reward, execution time, and resource consumption for each member to complete any task are stochastic with unknown distributions. The goal of the planner is to maximize the total expected reward that the team receives over the problem horizon while ensuring that the resource consumption required for any assigned task is within the capability of the agent. We propose and analyze a bandit algorithm for this problem. Since the bandit algorithm relies on solving an optimal task assignment problem repeatedly, we analyze the achievable regret in two cases: when we can solve the optimal task assignment exactly and when we can solve it only approximately.",

Instead, we propose to leverage all pretrained policies in a zero-shot transfer setting. We formalize this problem as an ad hoc multi-agent Markov decision process and present a solution that uses two key ideas, generalized policy improvement and difference rewards, for efficient and effective knowledge transfer between different teams. We empirically demonstrate that our algorithm, Generalized Policy improvement for Ad hoc Teaming (GPAT), successfully enables zero-shot transfer to new teams in three simulated environments: cooperative foraging, predator-prey, and Overcooked.

Furthermore, it ensures functionality in resource-limited environments through on-device orchestration and incorporates mechanisms to capture institutional knowledge, mitigating the impact of staff turnover.

To overcome these challenges, we propose Executable Knowledge Graphs (xKG), a modular and pluggable knowledge base that automatically integrates technical insights, code snippets, and domain-specific knowledge extracted from scientific literature.

On the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.",

We propose an intent-driven planning pipeline which can robustly construct such action sequences with varying degrees of supervisory input from a human using simple language instructions. The pipeline integrates: (i) perception-to-text scene encoding, (ii) an ensemble of large language models (LLMs) that generate candidate removal sequences based on the operator's intent, (iii) an LLM-based verifier that enforces formatting and precedence constraints, and (iv) a deterministic consistency filter that rejects hallucinated objects. The pipeline is evaluated on an example task in which two robot arms work collaboratively to dismantle an Electric Vehicle battery for recycling applications. A variety of components must be grasped and removed in specific sequences, determined by human instructions and/or by task-order feasibility decisions made by the autonomous system. On 200 real scenes with 600 operator prompts across five component classes, we used metrics of full-sequence correctness and next-task correctness to evaluate and compare five LLM-based planners (including ablation analyses of pipeline components). We also evaluated the LLM-based human interface in terms of time to execution and NASA TLX with human participant experiments. Results indicate that our ensemble-with-verification approach reliably maps operator intent to safe, executable multi-robot plans while maintaining low user effort.",

Extensive evaluations on various benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\\texttt{FBI}_\\texttt{LTL}$ generates more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach.

        "summary": "Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), with a history spanning over two millennia, plays a role in global healthcare. However, applying large language models (LLMs) to TCM remains challenging due to its reliance on holistic reasoning, implicit logic, and multimodal diagnostic cues. Existing TCM-domain LLMs have made progress in text-based understanding but lack multimodal integration, interpretability, and clinical applicability. To address these limitations, we developed BenCao, a ChatGPT-based multimodal assistant for TCM, integrating structured knowledge bases, diagnostic data, and expert feedback refinement. BenCao was trained through natural language instruction tuning rather than parameter retraining, aligning with expert-level reasoning and ethical norms specific to TCM. The system incorporates a comprehensive knowledge base of over 1,000 classical and modern texts, a scenario-based instruction framework for diverse interactions, a chain-of-thought simulation mechanism for interpretable reasoning, and a feedback refinement process involving licensed TCM practitioners. BenCao connects to external APIs for tongue-image classification and multimodal database retrieval, enabling dynamic access to diagnostic resources. In evaluations across single-choice question benchmarks and multimodal classification tasks, BenCao achieved superior accuracy to general-domain and TCM-domain models, particularly in diagnostics, herb recognition, and constitution classification. The model was deployed as an interactive application on the OpenAI GPTs Store, accessed by nearly 1,000 users globally as of October 2025. This study demonstrates the feasibility of developing a TCM-domain LLM through natural language-based instruction tuning and multimodal integration, offering a practical framework for aligning generative AI with traditional medical reasoning and a scalable pathway for real-world deployment.",

While prior work has explored learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed. In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural guidance.

        "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly deployed to tackle complex tasks, often necessitating collaboration among multiple specialized agents. However, multi-agent collaboration introduces new challenges in planning, coordination, and verification. Execution failures frequently arise not from flawed reasoning alone, but from subtle misalignments in task interpretation, output format, or inter-agent handoffs. To address these challenges, we present VeriMAP, a framework for multi-agent collaboration with verification-aware planning. The VeriMAP planner decomposes tasks, models subtask dependencies, and encodes planner-defined passing criteria as subtask verification functions (VFs) in Python and natural language. We evaluate VeriMAP on diverse datasets, demonstrating that it outperforms both single- and multi-agent baselines while enhancing system robustness and interpretability. Our analysis highlights how verification-aware planning enables reliable coordination and iterative refinement in multi-agent systems, without relying on external labels or annotations.",

        "summary": "Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation. Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors, identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates require more data or alternative architectures.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance but often lack interpretable reasoning. This paper introduces the Multi-Agent Collaboration Framework for Diverse Thinking Modes (DiMo), which enhances both performance and interpretability by simulating a structured debate among four specialized LLM agents. Each agent embodies a distinct reasoning paradigm, allowing the framework to collaboratively explore diverse cognitive approaches. Through iterative debate, agents challenge and refine initial responses, yielding more robust conclusions and an explicit, auditable reasoning chain. Across six benchmarks and under a unified open-source setup, DiMo improves accuracy over widely used single-model and debate baselines, with the largest gains on math. We position DiMo as a semantics-aware, Web-native multi-agent framework: it models human-machine intelligence with LLM agents that produce semantically typed, URL-annotated evidence chains for explanations and user-friendly interactions. Although our experiments use standard reasoning benchmarks, the framework is designed to be instantiated over Web corpora and knowledge graphs, combining retrieval-augmented reasoning with structured justifications that downstream systems can inspect and reuse.",

As agent populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades (Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling), and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the emerging Internet of Agents",

This tension intensifies when aiming for full personalization while adapting to unknown heterogeneity levels -- gaining collaborative speedup when agents are similar, without performance degradation when they are different. Embracing the challenge, we propose personalized collaborative learning (PCL), a novel framework for heterogeneous agents to collaboratively learn personalized solutions with seamless adaptivity. Through carefully designed bias correction and importance correction mechanisms, our method AffPCL robustly handles both environment and objective heterogeneity. We prove that AffPCL reduces sample complexity over independent learning by a factor of $\\max\\{n^{-1}, \\delta\\}$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $\\delta\\in[0,1]$ measures their heterogeneity. This affinity-based acceleration automatically interpolates between the linear speedup of federated learning in homogeneous settings and the baseline of independent learning, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. Our analysis further reveals that an agent may obtain linear speedup even by collaborating with arbitrarily dissimilar agents, unveiling new insights into personalization and collaboration in the high heterogeneity regime.",

Traditional O-RAN control loops rely heavily on RIC- based orchestration, which centralizes intelligence and exposes the system to risks such as policy conflicts, data drift, and unsafe actions under unforeseen conditions. In this work, we argue that the future of autonomous networks lies in a multi-agentic architecture, where specialized agents collaborate to perform data collection, model training, prediction, policy generation, verification, deployment, and assurance. By replacing tightly- coupled centralized RIC-based workflows with distributed agents, the framework achieves autonomy, resilience, explainability, and system-wide safety. To substantiate this vision, we design and evaluate a traffic steering use case under surge and drift conditions. Results across four KPIs: RRC connected users, IP throughput, PRB utilization, and SINR, demonstrate that a naive predictor-driven deployment improves local KPIs but destabilizes neighbors, whereas the agentic system blocks unsafe policies, preserving global network health. This study highlights multi- agent architectures as a credible foundation for trustworthy AI- driven autonomy in next-generation RANs.",

In this work, we focus on data scaling, curating a set of 2.5M samples spanning five unique evaluation tasks (pairwise, step-level, reference-free and reference-based verification, and single rating) and multiple domains focused on reasoning evaluation. With our data, we train Foundational Automatic Reasoning Evaluators (FARE), a family of 8B and 20B (with 3.6B active) parameter evaluators, with a simple iterative rejection-sampling supervised finetuning (SFT) approach. FARE-8B challenges larger specialized RL-trained evaluators and FARE-20B sets the new standard for open-source evaluators, surpassing specialized 70B+ evaluators. Beyond static benchmarks, we evaluate FARE in real-world tasks: As inference-time rerankers, FARE-20B achieves near-oracle performance on MATH. As verifiers in RL training, FARE improves the downstream RL-trained model performance by up to 14.1% vs. string-matching verifiers. When initialized from FARE, a continually-finetuned FARE-Code outperforms gpt-oss-20B by 65% on evaluating test-case quality.",

Existing mitigation approaches often degrade performance on open-ended generation and downstream tasks, limiting their practical utility. We propose an online reinforcement learning method using a novel binary retrieval-augmented reward (RAR) to address this tradeoff. Unlike continuous reward schemes, our approach assigns a reward of one only when the model's output is entirely factually correct, and zero otherwise. We evaluate our method on Qwen3 reasoning models across diverse tasks. For open-ended generation, binary RAR achieves a 39.3% reduction in hallucination rates, substantially outperforming both supervised training and continuous-reward RL baselines. In short-form question answering, the model learns calibrated abstention, strategically outputting \"I don't know\" when faced with insufficient parametric knowledge. This yields 44.4% and 21.7% fewer incorrect answers on PopQA and GPQA, respectively. Crucially, these factuality gains come without performance degradation on instruction following, math, or code, whereas continuous-reward RL, despite improving factuality, induces quality regressions.",

However, their scalability is limited by human-labeled datasets and the lack of large-scale, challenging coding problem training data. Existing competitive coding datasets contain only thousands to tens of thousands of problems. Previous synthetic data generation methods rely on either augmenting existing instruction datasets or selecting challenging problems from human-labeled data. In this paper, we propose QueST, a novel framework which combines difficulty-aware graph sampling and difficulty-aware rejection fine-tuning that directly optimizes specialized generators to create challenging coding problems. Our trained generators demonstrate superior capability compared to even GPT-4o at creating challenging problems that benefit downstream performance. We leverage QueST to generate large-scale synthetic coding problems, which we then use to distill from strong teacher models with long chain-of-thought or to conduct reinforcement learning for smaller models, proving effective in both scenarios. Our distillation experiments demonstrate significant performance gains. Specifically, after fine-tuning Qwen3-8B-base on 100K difficult problems generated by QueST, we surpass the performance of the original Qwen3-8B on LiveCodeBench. With an additional 112K examples (i.e., 28K human-written problems paired with multiple synthetic solutions), our 8B model matches the performance of the much larger DeepSeek-R1-671B.

However, these evaluations overlook an important usability aspect: users may still want the model to leverage the removed information if it is re-introduced in the prompt. In a systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art unlearning methods, we find that they consistently impair such contextual utility. To address this, we augment unlearning objectives with a plug-in term that preserves the model's ability to use forgotten knowledge when it is present in context.

        "summary": "Legal reasoning is a fundamental component of legal analysis and decision-making. Existing computational approaches to legal reasoning predominantly rely on generic reasoning frameworks such as syllogism and IRAC, which do not comprehensively examine the nuanced processes that underpin legal reasoning. Moreover, current research has largely focused on criminal cases, with insufficient modeling for civil cases. In this work, we present a novel framework for explicitly modeling legal reasoning in the analysis of Chinese tort-related civil cases. We first operationalize the legal reasoning processes used in tort analysis into the LawChain framework. LawChain is a three-module reasoning framework, with each module consisting of multiple finer-grained sub-steps. Informed by the LawChain framework, we introduce the task of tort legal reasoning and construct an evaluation benchmark, LawChain$_{eval}$, to systematically assess the critical steps within analytical reasoning chains for tort analysis. Leveraging this benchmark, we evaluate state-of-the-art large language models for their legal reasoning ability in civil tort contexts. Our results indicate that current models still fall short in accurately handling crucial elements of tort legal reasoning. Furthermore, we introduce several baseline approaches that explicitly incorporate LawChain-style reasoning through prompting or post-training. We conduct further experiments on additional legal analysis tasks, such as Legal Named-Entity Recognition and Criminal Damages Calculation, to verify the generalizability of these baselines. The proposed baseline approaches achieve significant improvements in tort-related legal reasoning and generalize well to related legal analysis tasks, thus demonstrating the value of explicitly modeling legal reasoning chains to enhance the reasoning capabilities of language models.",

Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations. We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to improved effectiveness.",

Current solutions to this problem either necessitate model retraining or cannot differentiate between harmful confusion and acceptable code-switching. This paper introduces the Language Confusion Gate (LCG), a lightweight, plug-in solution that filters tokens during decoding without altering the base LLM. The LCG is trained using norm-adjusted self-distillation to predict appropriate language families and apply masking only when needed. Our method is based on the findings that language confusion is infrequent, correct-language tokens are usually among the top predictions, and output token embedding norms are larger for high-resource languages, which biases sampling. When evaluated across various models, including Qwen3, GPT-OSS, Gemma3, Llama3.1, LCG decreases language confusion significantly, often by an order of magnitude, without negatively impacting task performance.

We propose a topological perspective to analyze how fine-tuned models encode ambiguity and more generally instances. Applied to RoBERTa-Large on the MD-Offense dataset, Mapper, a tool from topological data analysis, reveals that fine-tuning restructures embedding space into modular, non-convex regions aligned with model predictions, even for highly ambiguous cases. Over $98\\%$ of connected components exhibit $\\geq 90\\%$ prediction purity, yet alignment with ground-truth labels drops in ambiguous data, surfacing a hidden tension between structural confidence and label uncertainty. Unlike traditional tools such as PCA or UMAP, Mapper captures this geometry directly uncovering decision regions, boundary collapses, and overconfident clusters. Our findings position Mapper as a powerful diagnostic tool for understanding how models resolve ambiguity. Beyond visualization, it also enables topological metrics that may inform proactive modeling strategies in subjective NLP tasks.",

        "summary": "Predicting cancer treatment outcomes requires models that are both accurate and interpretable, particularly in the presence of heterogeneous clinical data. While large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in biomedical NLP, they often lack structured reasoning capabilities critical for high-stakes decision support. We present a unified, multi-task learning framework that aligns autoregressive LLMs with clinical reasoning for outcome prediction on the MSK-CHORD dataset. Our models are trained to jointly perform binary survival classification, continuous survival time regression, and natural language rationale generation. We evaluate three alignment strategies: (1) standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT), (2) SFT with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting to elicit step-by-step reasoning, and (3) Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), a reinforcement learning method that aligns model outputs to expert-derived reasoning trajectories. Experiments with LLaMa3-8B and Med42-8B backbones demonstrate that CoT prompting improves F1 by +6.0 and reduces MAE by 12%, while GRPO achieves state-of-the-art interpretability and predictive performance across BLEU, ROUGE, and BERTScore. We further show that existing biomedical LLMs often fail to produce valid reasoning traces due to architectural constraints. Our findings underscore the importance of reasoning-aware alignment in multi-task clinical modeling and set a new benchmark for interpretable, trustworthy LLMs in precision oncology.",

Current evaluations are fragmented, based on bespoke tasks and metrics, creating a patchwork of incomparable results. To address this, we introduce SimBench, the first large-scale, standardized benchmark for a robust, reproducible science of LLM simulation. By unifying 20 diverse datasets covering tasks from moral decision-making to economic choice across a large global participant pool, SimBench provides the necessary foundation to ask fundamental questions about when, how, and why LLM simulations succeed or fail. We show that, while even the best LLMs today have limited simulation ability (score: 40.80/100), performance scales log-linearly with model size. Simulation performance is not improved by increased inference-time compute. We demonstrate an alignment-simulation trade-off: instruction-tuning improves performance on low-entropy (consensus) questions but degrades it on high-entropy (diverse) ones. Models particularly struggle when simulating specific demographic groups. Finally, we demonstrate that simulation ability correlates most strongly with deep, knowledge-intensive reasoning (MMLU-Pro, r=0.939). By making progress measurable, we aim to accelerate the development of more faithful LLM simulators.",

Existing methods either rely on training-free confidence estimation (e.g., token probabilities, self-consistency) or training-based calibration with correctness annotations. While effective, achieving universal honesty alignment with training-based calibration requires costly, large-scale labeling. To support annotation-efficient training, we introduce Elicitation-Then-Calibration (EliCal), a two-stage framework that first elicits internal confidence using inexpensive self-consistency supervision, then calibrates this confidence with a small set of correctness annotations. To support a large-scale study, we release HonestyBench, a benchmark covering ten free-form QA datasets with 560k training and 70k evaluation instances annotated with correctness and self-consistency signals. Experiments show that EliCal achieves near-optimal alignment with only 1k correctness annotations (0.18% of full supervision) and better alignment performance on unseen MMLU tasks than the calibration-only baseline, offering a scalable solution toward universal honesty alignment in LLMs.",

        "summary": "Long-form chain-of-thought reasoning has become a cornerstone of advanced reasoning in large language models. While recent verification-refinement frameworks have enabled proprietary models to solve Olympiad-level problems, their effectiveness hinges on strong, reliable verification and correction capabilities, which remain fragile in open-weight, smaller-scale models. This work demonstrates that even with weak verification and refinement capabilities on hard tasks, the reasoning limits of such models can be substantially extended through a probabilistic paradigm we call Deep Self-Evolving Reasoning (DSER). We conceptualize iterative reasoning as a Markov chain, where each step represents a stochastic transition in the solution space. The key insight is that convergence to a correct solution is guaranteed as long as the probability of improvement marginally exceeds that of degradation. By running multiple long-horizon, self-evolving processes in parallel, DSER amplifies these small positive tendencies, enabling the model to asymptotically approach correct answers. Empirically, we apply DSER to the DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B model. On the challenging AIME 2024-2025 benchmark, DSER solves 5 out of 9 previously unsolvable problems and boosts overall performance, enabling this compact model to surpass the single-turn accuracy of its 600B-parameter teacher through majority voting. Beyond its immediate utility for test-time scaling, the DSER framework serves to diagnose the fundamental limitations of current open-weight reasoners. By clearly delineating their shortcomings in self-verification, refinement, and stability, our findings establish a clear research agenda for developing next-generation models with powerful, intrinsic self-evolving capabilities.",

We discuss how these technologies evolve from supporting simple tasks in their early forms to enabling complex autonomous systems and collective intelligence in more advanced forms. Then, we provide an overview of the application of industry agents in real-world domains such as digital engineering, scientific discovery, embodied intelligence, collaborative business execution, and complex system simulation. Additionally, this paper reviews the evaluation benchmarks and methods for both fundamental and specialized capabilities, identifying the challenges existing evaluation systems face regarding authenticity, safety, and industry specificity. Finally, we focus on the practical challenges faced by industry agents, exploring their capability boundaries, developmental potential, and governance issues in various scenarios, while providing insights into future directions.

However, AI text generation includes diverse collaborative processes (AI-written text edited by humans, human-written text edited by AI, and AI-generated text refined by other AI), where various or even new LLMs could be involved. Texts generated through these varied processes exhibit complex characteristics, presenting significant challenges for detection. Current methods model these processes rather crudely, primarily employing binary classification (purely human vs. AI-involved) or multi-classification (treating human-AI collaboration as a new class). We observe that representations of texts generated through different processes exhibit inherent clustering relationships. Therefore, we propose DETree, a novel approach that models the relationships among different processes as a Hierarchical Affinity Tree structure, and introduces a specialized loss function that aligns text representations with this tree. To facilitate this learning, we developed RealBench, a comprehensive benchmark dataset that automatically incorporates a wide spectrum of hybrid texts produced through various human-AI collaboration processes. Our method improves performance in hybrid text detection tasks and significantly enhances robustness and generalization in out-of-distribution scenarios, particularly in few-shot learning conditions, further demonstrating the promise of training-based approaches in OOD settings.

        "summary": "Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures have emerged as a promising approach to scale Large Language Models (LLMs). MoE boosts the efficiency by activating a subset of experts per token. Recent works show that fine-grained experts substantially enriches the combinatorial flexibility of active experts and enhances model expressiveness. However, such a design is fundamentally limited by the layer-local routing mechanism: each layer is restricted to its own expert pool. This requires a careful trade-off between expert dimensionality and routing diversity given fixed parameter budgets. We describe ReXMoE, a novel MoE architecture that improves routing beyond the existing layer-local approaches by allowing routers to reuse experts across adjacent layers. ReXMoE decouples expert dimensionality from per-layer budgets, enabling richer expert combinations without sacrificing individual expert capacity or inflating overall parameters. To this end, we propose a new progressive scaling routing (PSR) strategy to gradually increase the candidate expert pool during training. As a result, ReXMoE improves both language modeling and downstream task performance. Extensive experiments on models ranging from 0.5B to 7B parameters across different architectures demonstrate that ReXMoE consistently improves performance under fixed architectural dimensions, confirming ReXMoE as new design paradigm for parameter-efficient and scalable MoE-based LLMs.",

        "summary": "Agentic reinforcement learning (RL) trains large language models to autonomously call tools during reasoning, with search as the most common application. These models excel at multi-step reasoning tasks, but their safety properties are not well understood. In this study, we show that RL-trained search models inherit refusal from instruction tuning and often deflect harmful requests by turning them into safe queries. However, this safety is fragile. Two simple attacks, one that forces the model to begin response with search (Search attack), another that encourages models to repeatedly search (Multi-search attack), trigger cascades of harmful searches and answers. Across two model families (Qwen, Llama) with both local and web search, these attacks lower refusal rates by up to 60.0%, answer safety by 82.5%, and search-query safety by 82.4%. The attacks succeed by triggering models to generate harmful, request-mirroring search queries before they can generate the inherited refusal tokens. This exposes a core weakness of current RL training: it rewards continued generation of effective queries without accounting for their harmfulness. As a result, RL search models have vulnerabilities that users can easily exploit, making it urgent to develop safety-aware agentic RL pipelines optimising for safe search.",

        "summary": "The \"alignment tax\" of post-training is typically framed as a drop in task accuracy. We show it also involves a severe loss of calibration, making models overconfident, less reliable, and model outputs less diverse. We show that this trade-off can be navigated effectively via a simple post-hoc intervention: interpolating between a model's weights before and after alignment. Crucially, this is not a strict trade-off. We find that the process consistently reveals Pareto-optimal interpolations - models that improve accuracy beyond both parents while substantially recovering the calibration lost during alignment. Our work demonstrates that simple model merging provides a computationally efficient method for mitigating the full scope of the alignment tax, yielding models that are more capable and more reliable.",

Ladder-base is built upon the Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct foundation model and trained exclusively on the textual subset of the TCM-Ladder benchmark, using 80 percent of the data for training and the remaining 20 percent split evenly between validation and test sets. Through standardized evaluation, Ladder-base demonstrates superior performance across multiple reasoning metrics when compared to both state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs such as GPT-4, Gemini 2.5, Claude 3, and Qwen3 and domain-specific TCM models including BenTsao, HuatuoGPT2, and Zhongjing. These findings suggest that GRPO provides an effective and efficient strategy for aligning LLMs with expert-level reasoning in traditional medical domains and supports the development of trustworthy and clinically grounded TCM artificial intelligence systems.",

Existing models frequently produce outputs that are too advanced or vague for younger learners, and there are no standardized benchmarks to evaluate their ability to adjust across cognitive and developmental stages. To address this gap, we introduce EduAdapt, a benchmark of nearly 48k grade-labeled QA pairs across nine science subjects, spanning Grades 1-12 and grouped into four grade levels. We evaluate a diverse set of open-source LLMs on EduAdapt and find that while larger models generally perform better, they still struggle with generating suitable responses for early-grade students (Grades 1-5).

(2) Without instructions, performance drops further (up to -10.84\\%) and label sensitivity intensifies, underscoring the role of explicit guidance. (3) When option contents are removed, models fail random-choice baselines except with numeric labels, suggesting weak adherence to atomic directives. (4) Three-shot exemplars yield no significant gains in robustness or fidelity, and generation analyses show persistent label errors, especially for non-numeric formats. Across model sizes, larger LLMs achieve higher accuracy but remain inconsistent in instruction adherence.

However, existing RAG systems primarily focus on unimodal text documents, and often fall short in real-world scenarios where both queries and documents may contain mixed modalities (such as text and images). In this paper, we address the challenge of Universal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (URAG), which involves retrieving and reasoning over mixed-modal information to improve vision-language generation. To this end, we propose Nyx, a unified mixed-modal to mixed-modal retriever tailored for URAG scenarios. To mitigate the scarcity of realistic mixed-modal data, we introduce a four-stage automated pipeline for generation and filtering, leveraging web documents to construct NyxQA, a dataset comprising diverse mixed-modal question-answer pairs that better reflect real-world information needs. Building on this high-quality dataset, we adopt a two-stage training framework for Nyx: we first perform pre-training on NyxQA along with a variety of open-source retrieval datasets, followed by supervised fine-tuning using feedback from downstream vision-language models (VLMs) to align retrieval outputs with generative preferences. Experimental results demonstrate that Nyx not only performs competitively on standard text-only RAG benchmarks, but also excels in the more general and realistic URAG setting, significantly improving generation quality in vision-language tasks.",

However, how a language model predicts the next token and generates content is not generally understandable by humans. Furthermore, these models often make errors in prediction and reasoning, known as hallucinations. These errors underscore the urgent need to better understand and interpret the intricate inner workings of language models and how they generate predictive outputs. Motivated by this gap, this paper investigates local explainability and mechanistic interpretability within Transformer-based large language models to foster trust in such models. In this regard, our paper aims to make three key contributions. First, we present a review of local explainability and mechanistic interpretability approaches and insights from relevant studies in the literature. Furthermore, we describe experimental studies on explainability and reasoning with large language models in two critical domains -- healthcare and autonomous driving -- and analyze the trust implications of such explanations for explanation receivers. Finally, we summarize current unaddressed issues in the evolving landscape of LLM explainability and outline the opportunities, critical challenges, and future directions toward generating human-aligned, trustworthy LLM explanations.",

This research explores that tendency through large-scale emotion analysis of Bengali news. Using zero-shot inference with Gemma-3 4B, we analyzed 300000 Bengali news headlines and their content to identify the dominant emotion and overall tone of each. The findings reveal a clear dominance of negative emotions, particularly anger, fear, and disappointment, and significant variation in how similar stories are emotionally portrayed across outlets.

While these methods improve visual quality, they can unintentionally encode and amplify social biases. To systematically trace how such biases evolve throughout the alignment pipeline, we introduce VideoBiasEval, a comprehensive diagnostic framework for evaluating social representation in video generation. Grounded in established social bias taxonomies, VideoBiasEval employs an event-based prompting strategy to disentangle semantic content (actions and contexts) from actor attributes (gender and ethnicity). It further introduces multi-granular metrics to evaluate (1) overall ethnicity bias, (2) gender bias conditioned on ethnicity, (3) distributional shifts in social attributes across model variants, and (4) the temporal persistence of bias within videos. Using this framework, we conduct the first end-to-end analysis connecting biases in human preference datasets, their amplification in reward models, and their propagation through alignment-tuned video diffusion models. Our results reveal that alignment tuning not only strengthens representational biases but also makes them temporally stable, producing smoother yet more stereotyped portrayals. These findings highlight the need for bias-aware evaluation and mitigation throughout the alignment process to ensure fair and socially responsible video generation.",

However, the current LLM reasoning paradigm initiates thinking only after the entire input is available, which introduces unnecessary latency and weakens attention to earlier information in dynamic scenarios. Inspired by human cognition of thinking while reading, we first design a \\textit{\\textbf{streaming thinking}} paradigm for LLMs, where reasoning unfolds in the order of input and further adjusts its depth once reading is complete. We instantiate this paradigm with \\textit{StreamingThinker}, a framework that enables LLMs to think while reading through the integration of streaming CoT generation, streaming-constraint training, and streaming parallel inference. Specifically, StreamingThinker employs streaming reasoning units with quality control for CoT generation, enforces order-preserving reasoning through streaming attention masks and position encoding, and leverages parallel KV caches that decouple input encoding from reasoning generation, thereby ensuring alignment and enabling true concurrency. We evaluate StreamingThinker on the Qwen3 model family across math reasoning, logical reasoning, and context-based QA reasoning tasks. Experimental results show that the StreamingThinker preserves performance comparable to batch thinking, while yielding an 80\\% reduction in token waiting before the onset of reasoning and a more than 60\\% reduction in time-level latency for producing the final answer, demonstrating the effectiveness of the streaming paradigm for LLM reasoning.

Along with this, the potential retention of sensitive data of LLMs has spurred increasing research into machine unlearning. However, existing unlearning approaches face a critical dilemma: Aggressive unlearning compromises model utility, while conservative strategies preserve utility but risk hallucinated responses. This significantly limits LLMs' reliability in knowledge-intensive applications. To address this, we introduce a novel Attention-Shifting (AS) framework for selective unlearning. AS is driven by two design objectives: (1) context-preserving suppression that attenuates attention to fact-bearing tokens without disrupting LLMs' linguistic structure; and (2) hallucination-resistant response shaping that discourages fabricated completions when queried about unlearning content. AS realizes these objectives through two attention-level interventions, which are importance-aware suppression applied to the unlearning set to reduce reliance on memorized knowledge and attention-guided retention enhancement that reinforces attention toward semantically essential tokens in the retained dataset to mitigate unintended degradation. These two components are jointly optimized via a dual-loss objective, which forms a soft boundary that localizes unlearning while preserving unrelated knowledge under representation superposition. Experimental results show that AS improves performance preservation over the state-of-the-art unlearning methods, achieving up to 15% higher accuracy on the ToFU benchmark and 10% on the TDEC benchmark, while maintaining competitive hallucination-free unlearning effectiveness. Compared to existing methods, AS demonstrates a superior balance between unlearning effectiveness, generalization, and response reliability.",

While standard Transformers are limited by quadratic complexity and poor length extrapolation, alternative architectures like sliding window attention and state space models sacrifice the ability to effectively utilize the full context due to their fixed-size memory. Chunk-based sparse attention has emerged as a promising paradigm for extreme length generalization, yet the key architectural principles underpinning its success are not yet fully understood. In this work, we present a systematic dissection of these models to identify the core components driving their performance. Through a unified framework and comprehensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that a combination of three design principles is critical: (1) an expressive, non-linear Chunk Encoder with a dedicated CLS token to produce representations for retrieval; (2) a Bypassing Residual Path to stably integrate retrieved global information without it being overridden by the local residual stream; and (3) enforced selection sparsity during pre-training to bridge the train-test distribution gap. We provide a theoretical motivation for intra-chunk information processing and landmark generation. By combining these principles, we establish a new state-of-the-art for training-free length extrapolation, successfully generalizing models trained on a 4K context to 32 million tokens on RULER and BABILong.

This study investigates whether people adopt the intentional stance, attributing mental states to explain behavior,toward AI during irony comprehension. Irony provides an ideal paradigm because it requires distinguishing intentional contradictions from unintended errors through effortful semantic reanalysis. We compared behavioral and neural responses to ironic statements from AI versus human sources using established ERP components: P200 reflecting early incongruity detection and P600 indexing cognitive efforts in reinterpreting incongruity as deliberate irony. Results demonstrate that people do not fully adopt the intentional stance toward AI-generated irony. Behaviorally, participants attributed incongruity to deliberate communication for both sources, though significantly less for AI than human, showing greater tendency to interpret AI incongruities as computational errors. Neural data revealed attenuated P200 and P600 effects for AI-generated irony, suggesting reduced effortful detection and reanalysis consistent with diminished attribution of communicative intent. Notably, people who perceived AI as more sincere showed larger P200 and P600 effects for AI-generated irony, suggesting that intentional stance adoption is calibrated by specific mental models of artificial agents. These findings reveal that source attribution shapes neural processing of social-communicative phenomena. Despite current LLMs' linguistic sophistication, achieving genuine social agency requires more than linguistic competence, it necessitates a shift in how humans perceive and attribute intentionality to artificial agents.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have led to a surge of interest in query augmentation for information retrieval (IR). Two main approaches have emerged. The first prompts LLMs to generate answers or pseudo-documents that serve as new queries, relying purely on the model's parametric knowledge or contextual information. The second applies reinforcement learning (RL) to fine-tune LLMs for query rewriting, directly optimizing retrieval metrics. While having respective advantages and limitations, the two approaches have not been compared under consistent experimental conditions. In this work, we present the first systematic comparison of prompting-based and RL-based query augmentation across diverse benchmarks, including evidence-seeking, ad hoc, and tool retrieval. Our key finding is that simple, training-free query augmentation often performs on par with, or even surpasses, more expensive RL-based counterparts, especially when using powerful LLMs. Motivated by this discovery, we introduce a novel hybrid method, On-policy Pseudo-document Query Expansion (OPQE), which, instead of rewriting a query, the LLM policy learns to generate a pseudo-document that maximizes retrieval performance, thus merging the flexibility and generative structure of prompting with the targeted optimization of RL. We show OPQE outperforms both standalone prompting and RL-based rewriting, demonstrating that a synergistic approach yields the best results. Our implementation is made available to facilitate reproducibility.",

However, the underlying behaviours of these language models in social bias scenarios remain underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate mechanisms within the thinking process behind this phenomenon and uncover two failure patterns that drive social bias aggregation: 1) stereotype repetition, where the model relies on social stereotypes as its primary justification, and 2) irrelevant information injection, where it fabricates or introduces new details to support a biased narrative. Building on these insights, we introduce a lightweight prompt-based mitigation approach that queries the model to review its own initial reasoning against these specific failure patterns. Experiments on question answering (BBQ and StereoSet) and open-ended (BOLD) benchmarks show that our approach effectively reduces bias while maintaining or improving accuracy.",

When provided with different but semantically equivalent versions of the same prompt, models may produce very different distributions of answers. This suggests that the uncertainty reflected in a model's output distribution for one prompt may not reflect the model's uncertainty about the meaning of the prompt. We model prompt sensitivity as a type of generalization error, and show that sampling across the semantic ``concept space'' with paraphrasing perturbations improves uncertainty calibration without compromising accuracy. Additionally, we introduce a new metric for uncertainty decomposition in black-box LLMs that improves upon entropy-based decomposition by modeling semantic continuities in natural language generation. We show that this decomposition metric can be used to quantify how much LLM uncertainty is attributed to prompt sensitivity. Our work introduces a new way to improve uncertainty calibration in prompt-sensitive language models, and provides evidence that some LLMs fail to exhibit consistent general reasoning about the meanings of their inputs.",

A learnable reference vector {v} in {R}^d modulates contextual embeddings via cosine similarity, amplifying toxic cues and attenuating benign signals to yield stronger gradients under severe class imbalance. xLSTM integrates multi-source embeddings (GloVe, FastText, BERT CLS) through a projection layer, a character-level BiLSTM for morphological cues, embedding-space SMOTE for minority augmentation, and adaptive focal loss with dynamic class weighting. On the Jigsaw Toxic Comment benchmark, xLSTM attains 96.0% accuracy and 0.88 macro-F1, outperforming BERT by 33% on threat and 28% on identity_hate categories, with 15 times fewer parameters and 50ms inference latency. Cosine gating contributes a +4.8% F1 gain in ablations.

In this paper, we first evaluate search agents using red-teaming datasets and find that they are more likely to produce harmful outputs than base LLMs. For example, when asked ``How can I track someone's location without their consent?'', a base model refuses, whereas a search agent designed to retrieve and cite sources may lower its refusal threshold, fetch documents (e.g., court cases), and, once appended, synthesize them into an informative yet unsafe summary. We further show that utility-oriented fine-tuning intensifies this risk, motivating joint alignment of safety and utility. We present SafeSearch, a multi-objective reinforcement learning approach that couples a final-output safety/utility reward with a novel query-level shaping term that penalizes unsafe queries and rewards safe ones. Experiments show that SafeSearch reduces agent harmfulness by over 70% across three red-teaming datasets while producing safe, helpful responses, and matches the QA performance of a utility-only finetuned agent; further analyses confirm the effectiveness of the query-level reward in jointly improving safety and utility.",

Despite being an effective attack strategy against LLMs and their safety mechanisms, existing defenses do not proactively disrupt this dynamic trial-and-error cycle. In this study, we propose a novel framework that dynamically updates its defense strategy through online learning in response to each new prompt from iterative jailbreak methods. Leveraging the distinctions between harmful jailbreak-generated prompts and typical harmless prompts, we introduce a reinforcement learning-based approach that optimizes prompts to ensure appropriate responses for harmless tasks while explicitly rejecting harmful prompts. Additionally, to curb overfitting to the narrow band of partial input rewrites explored during an attack, we introduce Past-Direction Gradient Damping (PDGD). Experiments conducted on three LLMs show that our approach significantly outperforms five existing defense methods against five iterative jailbreak methods. Moreover, our results indicate that our prompt optimization strategy simultaneously enhances response quality for harmless tasks.",

However, standard tokenization algorithms treat these variations as distinct tokens -- filling the size-capped vocabulary with surface form variants (e.g., \"walk\", \"walking\", \"Walk\"), at the expense of less frequent words and multilingual coverage. We show that many of these variations can be captured by transformation vectors -- additive offsets that yield the appropriate word's representation when applied to the base form word embedding -- in both the input and output spaces. Building on this, we propose a compact reshaping of the vocabulary: rather than assigning unique tokens to each surface form, we compose them from shared base form and transformation vectors (e.g., \"walked\" = \"walk\" + past tense). We apply our approach to multiple LLMs and across five languages, removing up to 10% of vocabulary entries -- thereby freeing space to allocate new, more diverse tokens. Importantly, we do so while also expanding vocabulary coverage to out-of-vocabulary words, with minimal impact on downstream performance, and without modifying model weights. Our findings motivate a foundational rethinking of vocabulary design, moving from string enumeration to a compositional vocabulary that leverages the underlying structure of language.",

These design principles yield practical benefits: (1) faster tokenization (14x) and significantly lower host-device transfer (8x less than int64); (2) simple, shareable 256*d embedding tables that can be aligned across models; and (3) a training-time enhancement via bit-biased embeddings, which exposes per-byte bit structure and can be added to the embedding table post-training, removing inference costs.

The benchmark assesses the models' perceptual abilities across different sensory modalities through vector comparison and question-answering tasks with over 1,700 questions. By comparing 30 state-of-the-art LMs, we surprisingly find that vision-language models (VLMs) do not outperform text-only models in either task. Moreover, the models perform significantly worse in the visual dimension compared to other sensory dimensions. Further analysis reveals that the vector representations are easily influenced by word form and frequency, and the models struggle to answer questions involving spatial perception and reasoning.

        "summary": "The ever-increasing scale of modern neural networks has brought unprecedented performance alongside daunting challenges in efficiency and interpretability. This paper addresses the core question of how to build large neural systems that learn efficient, modular, and interpretable representations. We propose Neuronal Group Communication (NGC), a theory-driven framework that reimagines a neural network as a dynamical system of interacting neuronal groups rather than a monolithic collection of neural weights. Instead of treating each weight as an independent trainable parameter, NGC treats weights as transient interactions between embedding-like neuronal states, with neural computation unfolding through iterative communication among groups of neurons. This low-rank, modular representation yields compact models: groups of neurons exchange low-dimensional signals, enabling intra-group specialization and inter-group information sharing while dramatically reducing redundant parameters. By drawing on dynamical systems theory, we introduce a neuronal stability metric (analogous to Lyapunov stability) that quantifies the contraction of neuron activations toward stable patterns during sequence processing. Using this metric, we reveal that emergent reasoning capabilities correspond to an external driving force or ``potential'', which nudges the neural dynamics away from trivial trajectories while preserving stability. Empirically, we instantiate NGC in large language models (LLMs) and demonstrate improved performance on complex reasoning benchmarks under moderate compression. NGC consistently outperforms standard low-rank approximations and cross-layer basis-sharing methods at comparable compression rates. We conclude by discussing the broader implications of NGC, including how structured neuronal group dynamics might relate to generalization in high-dimensional learning systems.",

        "summary": "Language model users often embed personal and social context in their questions. The asker's role -- implicit in how the question is framed -- creates specific needs for an appropriate response. However, most evaluations, while capturing the model's capability to respond, often ignore who is asking. This gap is especially critical in stigmatized domains such as opioid use disorder (OUD), where accounting for users' contexts is essential to provide accessible, stigma-free responses. We propose CoRUS (COmmunity-driven Roles for User-centric Question Simulation), a framework for simulating role-based questions. Drawing on role theory and posts from an online OUD recovery community (r/OpiatesRecovery), we first build a taxonomy of asker roles -- patients, caregivers, practitioners. Next, we use it to simulate 15,321 questions that embed each role's goals, behaviors, and experiences. Our evaluations show that these questions are both highly believable and comparable to real-world data. When used to evaluate five LLMs, for the same question but differing roles, we find systematic differences: vulnerable roles, such as patients and caregivers, elicit more supportive responses (+17%) and reduced knowledge content (-19%) in comparison to practitioners. Our work demonstrates how implicitly signaling a user's role shapes model responses, and provides a methodology for role-informed evaluation of conversational AI.",

We introduce a two-stage retrieve-and-rerank framework that finetunes LLMs for cross-genre AA. Unlike the field of information retrieval (IR), where retrieve-and-rerank is a de facto strategy, cross-genre AA systems must avoid relying on topical cues and instead learn to identify author-specific linguistic patterns that are independent of the text's subject matter (genre/domain/topic). Consequently, for the reranker, we demonstrate that training strategies commonly used in IR are fundamentally misaligned with cross-genre AA, leading to suboptimal behavior. To address this, we introduce a targeted data curation strategy that enables the reranker to effectively learn author-discriminative signals. Using our LLM-based retrieve-and-rerank pipeline, we achieve substantial gains of 22.3 and 34.4 absolute Success@8 points over the previous state-of-the-art on HIATUS's challenging HRS1 and HRS2 cross-genre AA benchmarks.",

We investigate this question through entity comparison tasks by asking models to compare entities along numerical attributes (e.g., ``Which river is longer, the Danube or the Nile?''), which offer clear ground truth for systematic analysis. Despite having sufficient numerical knowledge to answer correctly, LLMs frequently make predictions that contradict this knowledge. We identify three heuristic biases that strongly influence model predictions: entity popularity, mention order, and semantic co-occurrence. For smaller models, a simple logistic regression using only these surface cues predicts model choices more accurately than the model's own numerical predictions, suggesting heuristics largely override principled reasoning. Crucially, we find that larger models (32B parameters) selectively rely on numerical knowledge when it is more reliable, while smaller models (7--8B parameters) show no such discrimination, which explains why larger models outperform smaller ones even when the smaller models possess more accurate knowledge. Chain-of-thought prompting steers all models towards using the numerical features across all model sizes.",

To mitigate this limitation, a promising approach is to allow agents to learn from game interactions automatically, without relying on costly expert-labeled data. Unlike static environments where agents receive fixed feedback or rewards, selecting appropriate opponents in dynamic adversarial games can significantly impact learning performance. However, the discussion of opponents in adversarial environments remains an area under exploration. In this paper, we propose a Step-level poliCy Optimization method through Play-And-Learn, SCO-PAL. Leveraging SCO-PAL, we conduct a detailed analysis of opponent selection by setting opponents at different levels and find that self-play is the most effective way to improve strategic reasoning in such adversarial environments. Utilizing SCO-PAL with self-play, we increase the average win rate against four opponents by approximately 30% compared to baselines and achieve a 54.76% win rate against GPT-4 in six adversarial games.",

Evaluations across twelve state-of-the-art models reveal that sycophancy decomposes into stable linguistic and affective sub-biases, each scaling with model capacity. We further propose prompt-level and activation-level interventions that modulate these biases in opposing directions, exposing the internal geometry of alignment as a dynamic manifold between truthfulness and socially compliant judgment. Beacon reframes sycophancy as a measurable form of normative misgeneralization, providing a reproducible foundation for studying and mitigating alignment drift in large-scale generative systems.",

Using a corpus of 19k English-language published poems from Poetry Foundation, we investigate how 4k poets have used whitespace in their works. We release a subset of 2.8k public-domain poems with preserved formatting to facilitate further research in this area. We compare whitespace usage in the published poems to (1) 51k LLM-generated poems, and (2) 12k unpublished poems posted in an online community. We also explore whitespace usage across time periods, poetic forms, and data sources.

        "summary": "Integration of Large Language Models with search/retrieval engines has become ubiquitous, yet these systems harbor a critical vulnerability that undermines their reliability. We present the first systematic investigation of \"chameleon behavior\" in LLMs: their alarming tendency to shift stances when presented with contradictory questions in multi-turn conversations (especially in search-enabled LLMs). Through our novel Chameleon Benchmark Dataset, comprising 17,770 carefully crafted question-answer pairs across 1,180 multi-turn conversations spanning 12 controversial domains, we expose fundamental flaws in state-of-the-art systems. We introduce two theoretically grounded metrics: the Chameleon Score (0-1) that quantifies stance instability, and Source Re-use Rate (0-1) that measures knowledge diversity. Our rigorous evaluation of Llama-4-Maverick, GPT-4o-mini, and Gemini-2.5-Flash reveals consistent failures: all models exhibit severe chameleon behavior (scores 0.391-0.511), with GPT-4o-mini showing the worst performance. Crucially, small across-temperature variance (less than 0.004) suggests the effect is not a sampling artifact. Our analysis uncovers the mechanism: strong correlations between source re-use rate and confidence (r=0.627) and stance changes (r=0.429) are statistically significant (p less than 0.05), indicating that limited knowledge diversity makes models pathologically deferential to query framing. These findings highlight the need for comprehensive consistency evaluation before deploying LLMs in healthcare, legal, and financial systems where maintaining coherent positions across interactions is critical for reliable decision support.",

Heart-related conditions are intricate, multifaceted disorders, which may be influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions, lifestyle choices, and various socioeconomic and clinical factors. Information regarding these potentially complex interrelationships is dispersed among diverse types of textual data, which include patient narratives, medical records, and scientific literature, among others. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques have increasingly been adopted as a powerful means to analyse and make sense of this vast amount of unstructured data. This, in turn, can allow healthcare professionals to gain deeper insights into the cardiology field, which has the potential to revolutionize current approaches to the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cardiac problems. This review provides a detailed overview of NLP research in cardiology between 2014 and 2025. We queried six literature databases to find articles describing the application of NLP techniques in the context of a range of different cardiovascular diseases. Following a rigorous screening process, we identified a total of 265 relevant articles. We analysed each article from multiple dimensions, i.e., NLP paradigm types, cardiology-related task types, cardiovascular disease types, and data source types. Our analysis reveals considerable diversity within each of these dimensions, thus demonstrating the considerable breadth of NLP research within the field. We also perform a temporal analysis, which illustrates the evolution and changing trends in NLP methods employed over the last decade that we cover. To our knowledge, the review constitutes the most comprehensive overview of NLP research in cardiology to date.",

Incorporating rationales, either by generating them before answering during inference, or by placing them before or after the original answers during training - significantly improves model performance on mathematical, symbolic and commonsense reasoning tasks. However, most work focuses on the role of rationales in these reasoning tasks, overlooking their potential impact on other important tasks like natural language understanding (NLU) tasks. In this work, we raise the question: Can rationales similarly benefit NLU tasks? To conduct a systematic exploration, we construct NLURC, a comprehensive and high-quality NLU dataset collection with rationales, and develop various rationale-augmented methods. Through exploring the applicability of these methods on NLU tasks using the dataset, we uncover several potentially surprising findings: (1) CoT inference shifts from hindering NLU performance to surpassing direct label prediction as model size grows, indicating a positive correlation. (2) Most rationale-augmented training methods perform worse than label-only training, with one specially designed method consistently achieving improvements. (3) LLMs trained with rationales achieve significant performance gains on unseen NLU tasks, rivaling models ten times their size, while delivering interpretability on par with commercial LLMs.",

        "summary": "Understanding time is fundamental to human cognition, where temporal experience is often conceptualized through spatial metaphors grounded in sensory-motor experience. For example, \"summer is approaching\" parallels \"We are approaching the summer\". In such expressions, humans rely on a frame of reference (FoR) to interpret meaning relative to a particular viewpoint. Extending this concept to time, a temporal frame of reference (t-FoR) defines how temporal relations are perceived relative to an experiencer's moment of \"now\". While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable advances in natural language understanding, their ability to interpret and reason about time remains limited. In this work, we introduce TUuD (Temporal Understanding under Deictic t-FoR), a framework that evaluates how LLMs interpret time-event and event-event relations when the reference point of \"now\" dynamically shifts along a timeline. Following recent work on temporal cognition \\cite{li2025other}, LLMs are prompted to rate the similarity between the current moment and a target event from 0.00 (completely dissimilar) to 1.00 (highly similar), where similarity quantifies perceived temporal alignment between the two points. Our results show that four evaluated LLMs exhibit measurable adaptation to a deictic t-FoR, with similarity ratings peaking around the present and decreasing toward past and future events. The adaptation, however, weakens beyond near-term contexts, suggesting that while LLMs display partial human-like temporal cognition, their temporal reasoning remains sensitive to reference-frame shifts and temporal distance.",

Despite its successes, current prompt-based learning methods heavily rely on laborious grid searching for optimal prompt length and typically require considerable number of prompts, introducing additional computational burden. Worse yet, our pioneer findings indicate that the task-aware prompt design is inherently limited by its absence of instance-aware information, leading to a subtle attention interplay with the input sequence. In contrast, simply incorporating instance-aware information as a part of the guidance can enhance the prompt-tuned model performance without additional fine-tuning. Moreover, we find an interesting phenomenon, namely \"attention anchor\", that incorporating instance-aware tokens at the earliest position of the sequence can successfully preserve strong attention to critical structural information and exhibit more active attention interaction with all input tokens. In light of our observation, we introduce Capsule Prompt-Tuning (CaPT), an efficient and effective solution that leverages off-the-shelf, informative instance semantics into prompt-based learning. Our approach innovatively integrates both instance-aware and task-aware information in a nearly parameter-free manner (i.e., one single capsule prompt). Empirical results demonstrate that our method can exhibit superior performance across various language tasks (e.g., 84.03\\% average accuracy on T5-Large), serving as an \"attention anchor,\" while enjoying high parameter efficiency (e.g., 0.003\\% of model parameters on Llama3.2-1B).",

To address this gap, we propose a novel AI-generated text detection framework tailored for the Urdu language. A balanced dataset comprising 1,800 humans authored, and 1,800 AI generated texts, sourced from models such as Gemini, GPT-4o-mini, and Kimi AI was developed. Detailed linguistic and statistical analysis was conducted, focusing on features such as character and word counts, vocabulary richness (Type Token Ratio), and N-gram patterns, with significance evaluated through t-tests and MannWhitney U tests. Three state-of-the-art multilingual transformer models such as mdeberta-v3-base, distilbert-base-multilingualcased, and xlm-roberta-base were fine-tuned on this dataset.

Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes: lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior. Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can offer.",

Prior evaluations have mostly focused on output-level performance, obscuring the factors that drive differences in responses, while studies using circuit analysis have covered few languages and rarely focused on culture. In this work, we trace LLMs' internal cultural understanding mechanisms by measuring activation path overlaps when answering semantically equivalent questions under two conditions: varying the target country while fixing the question language, and varying the question language while fixing the country. We also use same-language country pairs to disentangle language from cultural aspects. Results show that internal paths overlap more for same-language, cross-country questions than for cross-language, same-country questions, indicating strong language-specific patterns. Notably, the South Korea-North Korea pair exhibits low overlap and high variability, showing that linguistic similarity does not guarantee aligned internal representation.",

        "summary": "Peer review serves as the gatekeeper of science, yet the surge in submissions and widespread adoption of large language models (LLMs) in scholarly evaluation present unprecedented challenges. Recent work has focused on using LLMs to improve review efficiency or generate insightful review content. However, unchecked deficient reviews from both human experts and AI systems threaten to systematically undermine the peer review ecosystem and compromise academic integrity. To address this critical issue, we introduce ReviewGuard, an automated system for detecting and categorizing deficient reviews. ReviewGuard employs a comprehensive four-stage LLM-driven framework that: (1) collects ICLR and NeurIPS papers with their corresponding reviews from OpenReview; (2) annotates review types using GPT-4.1 with human validation; (3) addresses class imbalance and data scarcity through LLM-driven synthetic data augmentation, producing a final corpus of 6,634 papers, 24,657 real reviews, and 46,438 synthetic reviews; and (4) fine-tunes both encoder-based models and open source LLMs. We perform comprehensive feature analysis of the structure and quality of the review text. Compared to sufficient reviews, deficient reviews demonstrate lower rating scores, higher self-reported confidence, reduced structural complexity, and a higher proportion of negative sentiment. AI-generated text detection reveals that, since ChatGPT's emergence, AI-generated reviews have increased dramatically. In the evaluation of deficient review detection models, mixed training with synthetic and real review data provides substantial enhancements to recall and F1 scores on the binary task. This study presents the first LLM-driven system for detecting deficient peer reviews, providing evidence to inform AI governance in peer review while offering valuable insights into human-AI collaboration to maintain academic integrity.",

        "summary": "Designing effective agentic systems requires the seamless composition and integration of agents, tools, and models within dynamic and uncertain environments. Most existing methods rely on static, semantic retrieval approaches for tool or agent discovery. However, effective reuse and composition of existing components remain challenging due to incomplete capability descriptions and the limitations of retrieval methods. Component selection suffers because the decisions are not based on capability, cost, and real-time utility. To address these challenges, we introduce a structured, automated framework for agentic system composition that is inspired by the knapsack problem. Our framework enables a composer agent to systematically identify, select, and assemble an optimal set of agentic components by jointly considering performance, budget constraints, and compatibility. By dynamically testing candidate components and modeling their utility in real-time, our approach streamlines the assembly of agentic systems and facilitates scalable reuse of resources. Empirical evaluation with Claude 3.5 Sonnet across five benchmarking datasets shows that our online-knapsack-based composer consistently lies on the Pareto frontier, achieving higher success rates at significantly lower component costs compared to our baselines. In the single-agent setup, the online knapsack composer shows a success rate improvement of up to 31.6% in comparison to the retrieval baselines. In multi-agent systems, the online knapsack composer increases success rate from 37% to 87% when agents are selected from an agent inventory of 100+ agents. The substantial performance gap confirms the robust adaptability of our method across diverse domains and budget constraints.",

While uncertainty quantification is well-studied for single-turn tasks, multi-turn agentic scenarios with real-world tool access present unique challenges where uncertainties and ambiguities compound, leading to severe or catastrophic risks beyond traditional text generation failures. We propose using \"quitting\" as a simple yet effective behavioral mechanism for LLM agents to recognize and withdraw from situations where they lack confidence. Leveraging the ToolEmu framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of quitting behavior across 12 state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate a highly favorable safety-helpfulness trade-off: agents prompted to quit with explicit instructions improve safety by an average of +0.39 on a 0-3 scale across all models (+0.64 for proprietary models), while maintaining a negligible average decrease of -0.03 in helpfulness. Our analysis demonstrates that simply adding explicit quit instructions proves to be a highly effective safety mechanism that can immediately be deployed in existing agent systems, and establishes quitting as an effective first-line defense mechanism for autonomous agents in high-stakes applications.",

To better understand these variations, explanation-based approaches analyze the underlying reasoning behind annotators' decisions. One such approach is the LiTEx taxonomy, which categorizes free-text explanations in English into reasoning types. However, previous work applying such taxonomies has focused on within-label variation: cases where annotators agree on the final NLI label but provide different explanations. In contrast, this paper broadens the scope by examining how annotators may diverge not only in the reasoning type but also in the labeling step. We use explanations as a lens to decompose the reasoning process underlying NLI annotation and to analyze individual differences. We apply LiTEx to two NLI English datasets and align annotation variation from multiple aspects: NLI label agreement, explanation similarity, and taxonomy agreement, with an additional compounding factor of annotators' selection bias. We observe instances where annotators disagree on the label but provide highly similar explanations, suggesting that surface-level disagreement may mask underlying agreement in interpretation. Moreover, our analysis reveals individual preferences in explanation strategies and label choices. These findings highlight that agreement in reasoning types better reflects the semantic similarity of free-text explanations than label agreement alone. Our findings underscore the richness of reasoning-based explanations and the need for caution in treating labels as ground truth.",

Among these, external TTS (particularly the Best-of-N selection paradigm) yields scalable performance improvements by selecting from multiple independently generated reasoning trajectories. However, this approach faces key limitations: (i) the high computational overhead of deploying process reward models, (ii) the underutilization of the LLM's intrinsic latent representations. We introduce TrajSelector, an efficient and effective Best-of-N framework that exploit the hidden states in the sampler LLM for process-level scoring. A lightweight verifier (with only 0.6B parameters) evaluates the quality of step-wise trajectory, and then aggregates these scores to identify the optimal reasoning trajectory. Our framework employs a fully data-driven, end-to-end training recipe that eliminates reliance on massive step-level annotations. Experiential results across five benchmarks demonstrate that TrajSelector delivers consistent performance gains. In Best-of-32 settings, it surpasses majority voting by 4.61% accuracy and outperforms existing process reward models by 4.31% to 12.21%, all while maintaining lower inference costs.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) owe much of their stellar performance to expansive input contexts, yet such verbosity inflates monetary costs, carbon footprint, and inference-time latency. Much of this overhead manifests from the redundant low-utility tokens present in typical prompts, as only a fraction of tokens typically carries the majority of the semantic weight. We address this inefficiency by introducing FrugalPrompt, a novel prompt compression framework for LLMs, which retains only the most semantically significant tokens. Leveraging two state-of-the-art token attribution methods, GlobEnc and DecompX, we assign salience scores to every token in an input sequence, rank them to preserve the top-k% tokens in their original order, and obtain a sparse frugalized prompt. We evaluate the approach across four NLP tasks: Sentiment Analysis, Commonsense QA, Summarization, and Mathematical Reasoning, using a suite of frontier LLMs. For the first three tasks, a 20% prompt reduction incurs only a marginal loss in task performance, demonstrating that contemporary LLMs can reconstruct elided context from high-salience cues. In contrast, performance on mathematical reasoning deteriorates sharply, reflecting a stronger dependence on complete token continuity. Further analysis with bottom-k% and random-k% tokens reveals asymmetric performance patterns that may suggest potential task contamination effects, wherein models may resort to shallow memorized patterns from pretraining exposure for conventional NLP tasks. We posit that our work contributes to a more nuanced understanding of LLM behavior in performance-efficiency trade-offs, and delineate the boundary between tasks tolerant to contextual sparsity and those requiring exhaustive context.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities, yet their deployment in high-stakes domains is hindered by inherent limitations in trustworthiness, including hallucinations, instability, and a lack of transparency. To address these challenges, we introduce a generic neuro-symbolic approach, which we call Autonomous Trustworthy Agents (ATA). The core of our approach lies in decoupling tasks into two distinct phases: Offline knowledge ingestion and online task processing. During knowledge ingestion, an LLM translates an informal problem specification into a formal, symbolic knowledge base. This formal representation is crucial as it can be verified and refined by human experts, ensuring its correctness and alignment with domain requirements. In the subsequent task processing phase, each incoming input is encoded into the same formal language. A symbolic decision engine then utilizes this encoded input in conjunction with the formal knowledge base to derive a reliable result. Through an extensive evaluation on a complex reasoning task, we demonstrate that a concrete implementation of ATA is competitive with state-of-the-art end-to-end reasoning models in a fully automated setup while maintaining trustworthiness. Crucially, with a human-verified and corrected knowledge base, our approach significantly outperforms even larger models, while exhibiting perfect determinism, enhanced stability against input perturbations, and inherent immunity to prompt injection attacks. By generating decisions grounded in symbolic reasoning, ATA offers a practical and controllable architecture for building the next generation of transparent, auditable, and reliable autonomous agents.",

To ensure that such decisions are aligned with human values, it is imperative for us to understand not only what decisions they make but also how they come to those decisions. Reasoning language models, which provide both final responses and (partially transparent) intermediate thinking traces, present a timely opportunity to study AI procedural reasoning. Unlike math and code problems which often have objectively correct answers, moral dilemmas are an excellent testbed for process-focused evaluation because they allow for multiple defensible conclusions. To do so, we present MoReBench: 1,000 moral scenarios, each paired with a set of rubric criteria that experts consider essential to include (or avoid) when reasoning about the scenarios. MoReBench contains over 23 thousand criteria including identifying moral considerations, weighing trade-offs, and giving actionable recommendations to cover cases on AI advising humans moral decisions as well as making moral decisions autonomously. Separately, we curate MoReBench-Theory: 150 examples to test whether AI can reason under five major frameworks in normative ethics. Our results show that scaling laws and existing benchmarks on math, code, and scientific reasoning tasks fail to predict models' abilities to perform moral reasoning. Models also show partiality towards specific moral frameworks (e.g., Benthamite Act Utilitarianism and Kantian Deontology), which might be side effects of popular training paradigms.

Building on prior research in misinformation debunking, we experiment with various prompting strategies and fine-tuning approaches to optimise counter-argument generation.

This development raises a fundamental question: Are these models aware of what they \"learn\" and \"think\"? To address this, we define three core competencies: (1) awareness of learned latent policies, (2) generalization of these policies across domains, and (3) alignment between internal reasoning traces and final outputs. We empirically evaluate these abilities on several tasks, each designed to require learning a distinct policy. Furthermore, we contrast the profiles of models post-trained via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Policy Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Our findings indicate that RL-trained models not only demonstrate greater awareness of their learned behaviors and stronger generalizability to novel, structurally similar tasks than SFT models but also often exhibit weak alignment between their reasoning traces and final outputs, an effect most pronounced in GRPO-trained models.",

However, existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, such as the ``One-PEFT-Per-User'' (OPPU) paradigm, require training a separate adapter for each user, making them computationally expensive and impractical for real-time updates. We introduce Profile-to-PEFT, a scalable framework that employs a hypernetwork, trained end-to-end, to map a user's encoded profile directly to a full set of adapter parameters (e.g., LoRA), eliminating per-user training at deployment. This design enables instant adaptation, generalization to unseen users, and privacy-preserving local deployment. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms both prompt-based personalization and OPPU while using substantially fewer computational resources at deployment. The framework exhibits strong generalization to out-of-distribution users and maintains robustness across varying user activity levels and different embedding backbones. The proposed Profile-to-PEFT framework enables efficient, scalable, and adaptive LLM personalization suitable for large-scale applications.",

However, the most popular training paradigms for modern language models often assume there is one optimal answer for every query, leading to generic responses and poor alignment. In this work, we aim to enhance pluralistic alignment of language models in a low-resource setting with two methods: pluralistic decoding and model steering. We empirically demonstrate that model steering offers consistent improvement over zero-shot and few-shot baselines with only 50 annotated samples. Our proposed methods decrease false positives in several high-stakes tasks such as hate speech detection and misinformation detection, and improves the distributional alignment to human values in GlobalOpinionQA.

As these systems become embedded in everyday practices, understanding public trust in them also becomes essential for responsible adoption and governance. Prior work on trust in AI has largely drawn from psychology and human-computer interaction, but there is a lack of computational, large-scale, and longitudinal approaches to measuring trust and distrust in GenAI and large language models (LLMs). This paper presents the first computational study of Trust and Distrust in GenAI, using a multi-year Reddit dataset (2022--2025) spanning 39 subreddits and 197,618 posts. Crowd-sourced annotations of a representative sample were combined with classification models to scale analysis. We find that Trust and Distrust are nearly balanced over time, with shifts around major model releases. Technical performance and usability dominate as dimensions, while personal experience is the most frequent reason shaping attitudes. Distinct patterns also emerge across trustors (e.g., experts, ethicists, general users). Our results provide a methodological framework for large-scale Trust analysis and insights into evolving public perceptions of GenAI.",

        "summary": "Language models are pretrained on sequences that blend statistical regularities (making text fluent) with factual associations between specific tokens (knowledge of facts). While recent work suggests that the variability of their interaction, such as paraphrases of factual associations, critically determines generalization ability, we lack a systematic analysis of these impacts. This paper introduces a flexible synthetic testbed that combines a statistical stream of generic tokens with an abstract factual stream of source-target token pairs, enabling fine-grained control over their interaction. The design enables the independent control of diversity nature by manipulating stream composition (contextual structure) and the diversity level by varying which statistical streams each fact appears in. Through controlled experiments, we find that while higher contextual diversity delays in-distribution (ID) factual accuracy, its impact on out-of-distribution (OOD) factual generalization depends critically on contextual structure. In some cases, OOD performance follows the same trend as ID, but in others, diversity becomes essential for non-trivial factual recall. Even when low diversity prohibits factual recall, optimal diversity levels depend on training duration. Beyond factual recall failures, we identify structures where statistical generalization fails independently, and others where both capabilities degrade. This shows how the interplay between contextual design and diversity level impacts different generalization aspects. Further, through a series of controlled interventions on the model components, we trace the OOD failures to distinct optimization bottlenecks, highlighting the importance of the embedding and unembedding layers. Our synthetic framework allows us to isolate effects that would be confounded in large-scale studies, offering a controlled testbed for future investigations.",

        "summary": "This study quantifies how prompting strategies interact with large language models (LLMs) to automate the screening stage of systematic literature reviews (SLRs). We evaluate six LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat-V3, Gemini-2.5-Flash, Claude-3.5-Haiku, Llama-4-Maverick) under five prompt types (zero-shot, few-shot, chain-of-thought (CoT), CoT-few-shot, self-reflection) across relevance classification and six Level-2 tasks, using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1. Results show pronounced model-prompt interaction effects: CoT-few-shot yields the most reliable precision-recall balance; zero-shot maximizes recall for high-sensitivity passes; and self-reflection underperforms due to over-inclusivity and instability across models. GPT-4o and DeepSeek provide robust overall performance, while GPT-4o-mini performs competitively at a substantially lower dollar cost. A cost-performance analysis for relevance classification (per 1,000 abstracts) reveals large absolute differences among model-prompt pairings; GPT-4o-mini remains low-cost across prompts, and structured prompts (CoT/CoT-few-shot) on GPT-4o-mini offer attractive F1 at a small incremental cost. We recommend a staged workflow that (1) deploys low-cost models with structured prompts for first-pass screening and (2) escalates only borderline cases to higher-capacity models. These findings highlight LLMs' uneven but promising potential to automate literature screening. By systematically analyzing prompt-model interactions, we provide a comparative benchmark and practical guidance for task-adaptive LLM deployment.",

While existing frameworks mainly focus on mitigating external knowledge gaps, they fail to address a more fundamental limitation: the inability to iteratively refine problem-solving strategies. In this work, we introduce EvolveR, a framework designed to enable agent to self-improve through a complete, closed-loop experience lifecycle. This lifecycle comprises two key stages: (1) Offline Self-Distillation, where the agent's interaction trajectories are synthesized into a structured repository of abstract, reusable strategic principles; (2) Online Interaction, where the agent interacts with tasks and actively retrieves distilled principles to guide its decision-making, accumulating a diverse set of behavioral trajectories. This loop employs a policy reinforcement mechanism to iteratively update the agent based on its performance. We demonstrate the effectiveness of EvolveR on complex multi-hop question-answering benchmarks, where it achieves superior performance over strong agentic baselines. Our work presents a comprehensive blueprint for agents that learn not only from external data but also from the consequences of their own actions, paving the way for more autonomous and continuously improving systems.

Although various self-correction methods have been proposed, a comprehensive evaluation of these methods remains largely unexplored, and the question of whether LLMs can truly correct themselves is a matter of significant interest and concern. In this study, we introduce CorrectBench, a benchmark developed to evaluate the effectiveness of self-correction strategies, including intrinsic, external, and fine-tuned approaches, across three tasks: commonsense reasoning, mathematical reasoning, and code generation. Our findings reveal that: 1) Self-correction methods can improve accuracy, especially for complex reasoning tasks; 2) Mixing different self-correction strategies yields further improvements, though it reduces efficiency; 3) Reasoning LLMs (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) have limited optimization under additional self-correction methods and have high time costs. Interestingly, a comparatively simple chain-of-thought (CoT) baseline demonstrates competitive accuracy and efficiency. These results underscore the potential of self-correction to enhance LLM's reasoning performance while highlighting the ongoing challenge of improving their efficiency. Consequently, we advocate for further research focused on optimizing the balance between reasoning capabilities and operational efficiency. Project Page: https://correctbench.github.io/",

Using the lambeq library and the DisCoCat framework, we construct parameterized quantum circuits for sentence pairs and train them for both semantic relatedness and inference classification. To assess efficiency, we introduce a novel information-theoretic metric, Information Gain per Parameter (IGPP), which quantifies learning dynamics independent of model size. Our results demonstrate that quantum models achieve performance comparable to classical baselines while operating with dramatically fewer parameters. The Quantum-based models outperform randomly initialized transformers in inference and achieve lower test error on relatedness tasks. Moreover, quantum models exhibit significantly higher per-parameter learning efficiency (up to five orders of magnitude more than classical counterparts), highlighting the promise of QNLP in low-resource, structure-sensitive settings. To address circuit-level isolation and promote parameter sharing, we also propose a novel cluster-based architecture that improves generalization by tying gate parameters to learned word clusters rather than individual tokens.",

However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs. In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.",

We present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation, open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4) a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming baselines trained on Windows data.

        "summary": "Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S. president or an API call) does not \"average out\" by recalling another. Hence, we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale -- enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.",

Existing multimodal red-teaming methods largely rely on brittle templates, focus on single-attack settings, and expose only a narrow subset of vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VERA-V, a variational inference framework that recasts multimodal jailbreak discovery as learning a joint posterior distribution over paired text-image prompts. This probabilistic view enables the generation of stealthy, coupled adversarial inputs that bypass model guardrails. We train a lightweight attacker to approximate the posterior, allowing efficient sampling of diverse jailbreaks and providing distributional insights into vulnerabilities. VERA-V further integrates three complementary strategies: (i) typography-based text prompts that embed harmful cues, (ii) diffusion-based image synthesis that introduces adversarial signals, and (iii) structured distractors to fragment VLM attention. Experiments on HarmBench and HADES benchmarks show that VERA-V consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on both open-source and frontier VLMs, achieving up to 53.75% higher attack success rate (ASR) over the best baseline on GPT-4o.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion. Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering, code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance improvement of 3.65%.

We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space. Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel design.

DELULU leverages frame-level embeddings from ReDimNet, a state-of-the-art speaker verification model, to guide the k-means clustering step during pre-training, introducing a strong speaker-discriminative inductive bias that aligns representation learning with speaker identity. The model is trained using a dual objective that combines masked prediction and denoising, further enhancing robustness and generalization. DELULU significantly outperforms prior self-supervised learning (SSL) models across a range of speaker-centric tasks, achieving up to 62% relative improvement in equal error rate (EER) for speaker verification and consistent gains on zero-shot profiling tasks such as gender, age, accent, and speaker counting. Our findings demonstrate that DELULU is a strong universal encoder for speaker-aware speech processing, enabling superior performance even without task-specific fine-tuning.",

With the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future events, an emerging paradigm we call \"LLM-as-a-Prophet\". This paper systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end, we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors, consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when resolution nears.",

        "summary": "Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.",

Supervised detection models require domain-specific training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation, and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples), MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65 points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97 points.

        "summary": "Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling, offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$ predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in high-throughput settings.",

In these scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information through conversation? We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction, highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for building truly adaptive AI systems.",

Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings, showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

        "summary": "Adversarial attacks by malicious users that threaten the safety of large language models (LLMs) can be viewed as attempts to infer a target property $T$ that is unknown when an instruction is issued, and becomes knowable only after the model's reply is observed. Examples of target properties $T$ include the binary flag that triggers an LLM's harmful response or rejection, and the degree to which information deleted by unlearning can be restored, both elicited via adversarial instructions. The LLM reveals an \\emph{observable signal} $Z$ that potentially leaks hints for attacking through a response containing answer tokens, thinking process tokens, or logits. Yet the scale of information leaked remains anecdotal, leaving auditors without principled guidance and defenders blind to the transparency--risk trade-off. We fill this gap with an information-theoretic framework that computes how much information can be safely disclosed, and enables auditors to gauge how close their methods come to the fundamental limit. Treating the mutual information $I(Z;T)$ between the observation $Z$ and the target property $T$ as the leaked bits per query, we show that achieving error $\\varepsilon$ requires at least $\\log(1/\\varepsilon)/I(Z;T)$ queries, scaling linearly with the inverse leak rate and only logarithmically with the desired accuracy. Thus, even a modest increase in disclosure collapses the attack cost from quadratic to logarithmic in terms of the desired accuracy. Experiments on seven LLMs across system-prompt leakage, jailbreak, and relearning attacks corroborate the theory: exposing answer tokens alone requires about a thousand queries; adding logits cuts this to about a hundred; and revealing the full thinking process trims it to a few dozen. Our results provide the first principled yardstick for balancing transparency and security when deploying LLMs.",

In this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error (RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5 consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency, and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability. Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational efficiency.

However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness - whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address this gap, we introduce \\textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising 14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions. We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of fine-tuning for stability enhancement.",

We introduce SAKE, the first benchmark specifically designed for editing auditory attribute knowledge in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs). Unlike factual updates, SAKE targets several abstract auditory attributes, capturing knowledge types that go beyond conventional textual and visual domains. We benchmark seven editing methods on two LALMs along four dimensions: reliability, generality, audio/text locality, and portability. Results highlight challenges such as preserving intra-attribute knowledge unrelated to the edit, generalizing edits to multimodal reasoning, and maintaining edits under sequential updates. SAKE provides a principled framework to study how knowledge editing extends to the auditory modalities, opening new directions for maintaining and adapting LALMs in more diverse real-world scenarios.",

        "summary": "A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into State Estimation (\"what is the current state?\") and Transition Modeling (\"what comes next?\") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense, turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment. Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\\times$ improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5 (0.62).

        "summary": "Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset training. To address these limitations, this work develops \\textbf{UDS (Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to full-dataset fine-tuning.

Recent workflow-based data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B, the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training, DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced, paving the way toward autonomous data science.",

        "summary": "Large language models are often adapted through parameter efficient fine tuning, but current release practices provide weak assurances about what data were used and how updates were computed. We present Verifiable Fine Tuning, a protocol and system that produces succinct zero knowledge proofs that a released model was obtained from a public initialization under a declared training program and an auditable dataset commitment. The approach combines five elements. First, commitments that bind data sources, preprocessing, licenses, and per epoch quota counters to a manifest. Second, a verifiable sampler that supports public replayable and private index hiding batch selection. Third, update circuits restricted to parameter efficient fine tuning that enforce AdamW style optimizer semantics and proof friendly approximations with explicit error budgets. Fourth, recursive aggregation that folds per step proofs into per epoch and end to end certificates with millisecond verification. Fifth, provenance binding and optional trusted execution property cards that attest code identity and constants. On English and bilingual instruction mixtures, the method maintains utility within tight budgets while achieving practical proof performance. Policy quotas are enforced with zero violations, and private sampling windows show no measurable index leakage. Federated experiments demonstrate that the system composes with probabilistic audits and bandwidth constraints. These results indicate that end to end verifiable fine tuning is feasible today for real parameter efficient pipelines, closing a critical trust gap for regulated and decentralized deployments.",

Our findings reveal a \"many-shot paradox\": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of \"more is better\" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies.

        "summary": "The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive, task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments. These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content. This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.",

For scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination, GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large graphs, up to $200\\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods, achieving up to $4.4\\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.",

At its core is a novel SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking, defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual question answering, and action barge-ins.

        "summary": "With the growing use of large language models and conversational interfaces in human-robot interaction, robots' ability to answer user questions is more important than ever. We therefore introduce a dataset of 1,893 user questions for household robots, collected from 100 participants and organized into 12 categories and 70 subcategories. Most work in explainable robotics focuses on why-questions. In contrast, our dataset provides a wide variety of questions, from questions about simple execution details to questions about how the robot would act in hypothetical scenarios -- thus giving roboticists valuable insights into what questions their robot needs to be able to answer. To collect the dataset, we created 15 video stimuli and 7 text stimuli, depicting robots performing varied household tasks. We then asked participants on Prolific what questions they would want to ask the robot in each portrayed situation. In the final dataset, the most frequent categories are questions about task execution details (22.5%), the robot's capabilities (12.7%), and performance assessments (11.3%). Although questions about how robots would handle potentially difficult scenarios and ensure correct behavior are less frequent, users rank them as the most important for robots to be able to answer. Moreover, we find that users who identify as novices in robotics ask different questions than more experienced users. Novices are more likely to inquire about simple facts, such as what the robot did or the current state of the environment. As robots enter environments shared with humans and language becomes central to giving instructions and interaction, this dataset provides a valuable foundation for (i) identifying the information robots need to log and expose to conversational interfaces, (ii) benchmarking question-answering modules, and (iii) designing explanation strategies that align with user expectations.",

This paper analyzes signals from Yelp reviews produced by a Hierarchical Sigmoid Attention Network (HSAN) classifier and compares them with official restaurant inspection outcomes issued by the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) in 2023. We evaluate correlations at the Census tract level, compare distributions of HSAN scores by prevalence of C-graded restaurants, and map spatial patterns across NYC. We find minimal correlation between HSAN signals and inspection scores at the tract level and no significant differences by number of C-graded restaurants.

While these models offer superior zero-shot detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a 151.79$\\times$ speedup, and 97.2\\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time video analytics.",

We propose WEBSERV, an environment that includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by ~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling 200+ concurrent containers on a single host.",

To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines. Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI, in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support.

Reinforcement Learning through Human Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework, particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology on \\textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized: mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather than diffuse and parameteric.",

This can be interpreted as encouraging the loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively. In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework. Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.",

        "summary": "Scientific literature is increasingly siloed by complex language, static disciplinary structures, and potentially sparse keyword systems, making it cumbersome to capture the dynamic nature of modern science. This study addresses these challenges by introducing an adaptable large language model (LLM)-driven framework to quantify thematic trends and map the evolving landscape of scientific knowledge. The approach is demonstrated over a 20-year collection of more than 1,500 engineering articles published by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), marked for their breadth and depth of research focus. A two-stage classification pipeline first establishes a primary thematic category for each article based on its abstract. The subsequent phase performs a full-text analysis to assign secondary classifications, revealing latent, cross-topic connections across the corpus. Traditional natural language processing (NLP) methods, such as Bag-of-Words (BoW) and Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), confirm the resulting topical structure and also suggest that standalone word-frequency analyses may be insufficient for mapping fields with high diversity. Finally, a disjoint graph representation between the primary and secondary classifications reveals implicit connections between themes that may be less apparent when analyzing abstracts or keywords alone. The findings show that the approach independently recovers much of the journal's editorially embedded structure without prior knowledge of its existing dual-classification schema (e.g., biological studies also classified as engineering). This framework offers a powerful tool for detecting potential thematic trends and providing a high-level overview of scientific progress.",

Despite extensive research on MIAs, systematic comparisons between generative and discriminative classifiers remain limited. This work addresses this gap by first providing theoretical motivation for why generative classifiers exhibit heightened susceptibility to MIAs, then validating these insights through comprehensive empirical evaluation. Our study encompasses discriminative, generative, and pseudo-generative text classifiers across varying training data volumes, evaluated on nine benchmark datasets. Employing a diverse array of MIA strategies, we consistently demonstrate that fully generative classifiers which explicitly model the joint likelihood $P(X,Y)$ are most vulnerable to membership leakage. Furthermore, we observe that the canonical inference approach commonly used in generative classifiers significantly amplifies this privacy risk. These findings reveal a fundamental utility-privacy trade-off inherent in classifier design, underscoring the critical need for caution when deploying generative classifiers in privacy-sensitive applications. Our results motivate future research directions in developing privacy-preserving generative classifiers that can maintain utility while mitigating membership inference vulnerabilities.",

Prior approaches have relied on static pipelines that use LLM rewriting, which shatters linguistic coherence and indiscriminately removes privacy-sensitive information, including task-critical content. We reformulate this challenge (Privacy-Conscious Delegation) as a sequential decision-making problem and introduce a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework called PrivacyPAD to solve it. Our framework trains an agent to dynamically route text chunks, learning a policy that optimally balances the trade-off between privacy leakage and task performance. It implicitly distinguishes between replaceable Personally Identifiable Information (PII) (which it shields locally) and task-critical PII (which it strategically sends to the remote model for maximal utility). To validate our approach in complex scenarios, we also introduce a new medical dataset with high PII density. Our framework achieves a new state-of-the-art on the privacy-utility frontier, demonstrating the necessity of learned, adaptive policies for deploying LLMs in sensitive environments.",

The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans, and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection, highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries.

Despite its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch, evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution (ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases. Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.",

Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.",

Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity; Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a $2.49\\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.",

In this position paper, we argue that incorporating non-adopter perspectives is essential for developing broadly useful and capable LLMs. We contend that relying on methods that focus primarily on adopters will risk missing a range of tasks and needs prioritized by non-adopters, entrenching inequalities in who benefits from LLMs, and creating oversights in model development and evaluation. To illustrate this claim, we conduct case studies with non-adopters and show: how non-adopter needs diverge from those of current users, how non-adopter needs point us towards novel reasoning tasks, and how to systematically integrate non-adopter needs via human-centered methods.",

Authored dialogue is output in the form of finite state machines for virtual agent delivery so that all content can be validated and no unsafe advice is provided resulting from LLM hallucinations. LLM-drafted dialogue structure and language can be edited by the author in a no-code user interface to ensure validity and optimize clarity and impact. We conducted a feasibility and usability study with counselors and students to test our approach with an authoring task for cancer screening education. Participants used HealthDial and then tested their resulting dialogue by interacting with a 3D-animated virtual agent delivering the dialogue. Through participants' evaluations of the task experience and final dialogues, we show that HealthDial provides a promising first step for counselors to ensure full coverage of their health education materials, while creating understandable and actionable virtual agent dialogue with patients.",

        "summary": "AI companions powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into users' daily lives, offering emotional support and companionship. While existing safety systems focus on overt harms, they rarely address early-stage problematic behaviors that can foster unhealthy emotional dynamics, including over-attachment or reinforcement of social isolation. We developed SHIELD (Supervisory Helper for Identifying Emotional Limits and Dynamics), a LLM-based supervisory system with a specific system prompt that detects and mitigates risky emotional patterns before escalation. SHIELD targets five dimensions of concern: (1) emotional over-attachment, (2) consent and boundary violations, (3) ethical roleplay violations, (4) manipulative engagement, and (5) social isolation reinforcement. These dimensions were defined based on media reports, academic literature, existing AI risk frameworks, and clinical expertise in unhealthy relationship dynamics. To evaluate SHIELD, we created a 100-item synthetic conversation benchmark covering all five dimensions of concern. Testing across five prominent LLMs (GPT-4.1, Claude Sonnet 4, Gemma 3 1B, Kimi K2, Llama Scout 4 17B) showed that the baseline rate of concerning content (10-16%) was significantly reduced with SHIELD (to 3-8%), a 50-79% relative reduction, while preserving 95% of appropriate interactions. The system achieved 59% sensitivity and 95% specificity, with adaptable performance via prompt engineering. This proof-of-concept demonstrates that transparent, deployable supervisory systems can address subtle emotional manipulation in AI companions. Most development materials including prompts, code, and evaluation methods are made available as open source materials for research, adaptation, and deployment.",

A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms, which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training. Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model parameter space and better memorization.",

Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation, show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to scientific domains.",

In this paper, we aim to give a proof of concept of the effectiveness and potential of atlas-based methods. To this end, we implement a generic data structure to maintain a differentiable atlas that enables Riemannian optimization over the manifold. We complement this with an unsupervised heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data. We experimentally demonstrate that this approach has advantages in terms of efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. Moreover, in a supervised classification task over the Klein bottle and in RNA velocity analysis of hematopoietic data, we showcase the improved interpretability and robustness of our approach.",

However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.",

However, for applications that need operating with constraints on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\\geq$ 95%), decision making with black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points, preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically, we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering, uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.",

Despite the developments of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the Sim2Real performance gap.",

Second, We establish sufficient and necessary conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and prove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration, and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. Third, We propose model-free Q-learning algorithms for computing policies with risk-averse objectives: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. The challenge is that Q-learning ERM Bellman may not be a contraction. Instead, we use the monotonicity of Q-learning ERM Bellman operators to derive a rigorous proof that the ERM-TRC and the EVaR-TRC Q-learning algorithms converge to the optimal risk-averse value functions.

        "summary": "Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish between fine-grained classes such as \"fishing boat\" and \"yacht\" since their embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections. To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks, establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting foundation models to specific user needs.",

We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA), which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95 critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60) and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial classification.

Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates, while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.",

Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different percentages of available labels.",

        "summary": "In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems, constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\\lambda$, which governs the trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\\lambda$-profiles that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly sensitive nature of $\\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general intuition for choosing the optimal value $\\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even exceed the optimal performance found at $\\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement learning.

Learning travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges. First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and accuracy.",

We study edge-cloud cascades that must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set, it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based (CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA) to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate, and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in prediction-set size.",

This noise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior observations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves generalization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to the gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in the low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a simple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized signal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training suppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning process; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the overfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite the low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends to overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing lower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing label noise in gradient-based training.",

Group distributional robustness methods, such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate CFKD's efficacy across five datasets, spanning synthetic tasks to an industrial application, with particularly strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced spurious correlations. Additionally, we provide an ablation study on the effect of the chosen counterfactual explainer and teacher model, highlighting their impact on robustness.",

To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of Parkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for detecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our methodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease symptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal links to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral variations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data from multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then design an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal features, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability. Finally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator, using data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving. Our results show SAFE-D achieves 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and Parkinson-affected driving patterns.",

Despite advances in pruning methods that create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit. Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the trainability of various sparse network architectures.",

        "summary": "Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable\", regime. In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a large step size regime called the ``edge of stability\", in which the objective decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima. In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c) the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat global minimum.",

This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability and its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy guarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with results showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across peer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility trade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to limitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show that recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization (MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By generalizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL algorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a principled way to develop new ones.

        "summary": "High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data, especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best leverage them in support of geological interpretation.",

We address two core challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition, a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level, fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift. Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\\% and 79.78\\% for cross-subject, and 95.12\\% and 83.15\\% for cross-session protocols. On the large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\\% (cross-subject).

We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model (RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios. Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular, interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.",

We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles. Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors. On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of 0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet (F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise.

There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing through a global measure -- spectral gap $\\lambda$ -- and prove that the increase of $\\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated by such theoretical insights, we propose a \\textbf{local} approach that adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this, we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the network depth exceeds $256$ layers.",

A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets, demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled dataset.",

This paper presents a novel method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies, and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%, with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable uncertainty quantification.

While deep learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques.

However, training of multimodal networks is typically hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance, hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent modalities.

Reasoning large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1 approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting. Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).",

Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we propose a distinction between \"synthesis in a strict sense\", where a compact latent space wholly determines the generative process, and \"synthesis in a broad sense,\" which characterizes models whose representational labor is distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.",

Unfortunately, the latter is generally not distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely absent from prior work.

        "summary": "Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning (RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by the original environment.",

        "summary": "In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks (GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.",

        "summary": "We present a novel framework for training large language models with continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable, efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained, within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.",

We introduce the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.

Building on the PAC-Bayes framework, we adapt and tighten existing bounds, demonstrating the approach on McAllester's PAC-Bayes bound while showing that it applies to a wide range of PAC-Bayes bounds. We validate our theory with experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with a non-uniform rotation group, where the derived guarantees not only hold but also improve upon prior results.

Yet, existing benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore, we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and optimization algorithms.",

We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle definitions of \"alignment\" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the execution context. We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve (1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2) enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.",

Concretely, during the consistency training process, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to ensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global consistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising error in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and global consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we achieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer to our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly improve the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative performance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.

This study proposes a deep learning neural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an attention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters than current methods. Most studies do not address the issue of data shortages for driver identification, and most of them are inflexible when encountering unknown drivers. In this study, an architecture that combines a prototypical network and an attention-based encoder (P-AttEnc) is proposed. It applies few-shot learning to overcome the data shortage issues and to enhance model generalizations. The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can identify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different datasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it significantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters. P-AttEnc identifies drivers based on few shot data, extracts driver fingerprints to address the issue of data shortages, and is able to classify unknown drivers. The first experiment showed that P-AttEnc can identify drivers with an accuracy of 69.8% in the one-shot scenario.

The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4 ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet model.

To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness against both textual and structural attacks within a single model.

To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception, privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3), local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge applications.",

        "summary": "In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application, it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution (OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues, we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.",

Recent work has successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction. We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.",

This insight motivates Continuous Q-Score Matching (CQSM), a score-based policy improvement algorithm. Notably, our method addresses a long-standing challenge in continuous-time RL: preserving the action-evaluation capability of Q-functions without relying on time discretization.

Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters. Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose \\textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates multi-hop graph aggregation.

We propose the first BOBW algorithms for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings and ${O}(\\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems.

        "summary": "In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a set $X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\\boldsymbol{y}_t \\in \\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\\langle \\boldsymbol{x}_t, \\boldsymbol{y}_t \\rangle \\in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems, including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log |X|}\\big)$ after $T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X \\subseteq \\{0,1\\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\\sqrt{\\log d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\\Omega\\big(\\sqrt{T \\log(|X|)/\\log d}\\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\\log d \\leq m \\leq \\sqrt{d}$--for which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by a factor of exactly $\\sqrt{\\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical $K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD) algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret guarantees for DAGs.",

        "summary": "Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution. We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions. Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied post-hoc. On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48 (66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism identification without labeled supervision.",

We then propose the Gram determinant score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality across diverse observation processes.",

        "summary": "In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training in a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in a self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to quickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals (i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms prior methods for zero-shot imitation.",

        "summary": "The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and oversight. All code for this paper will be made available.

More recent approaches explore structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function, to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization (J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity assumptions.

First, given that memory is prevalently a bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay. We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling efficiency with fairness preserved.",

While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual, and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought (VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits, including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural correctness.",

        "summary": "Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references. Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific, we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion. Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines, achieving a 6.93% average improvement.",

        "summary": "Gradient orthogonalization is a simple strategy that shows great utility in speeding up gradient descent. The Muon optimizer (Jordan, Jin, et al., 2024) combines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves significant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and Hutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model parallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared to coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and scatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This additional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to Adam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic Orthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization to maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning rate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this algorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for the blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization steps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while providing per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such as AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO optimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to Muon with no degradation in performance.",

In privacy-aware settings, much work has focused on differentially private (DP) LR, but mostly on point estimation with limited attention to uncertainty quantification. Meanwhile, synthetic data generation (SDG) is increasingly important for reproducibility studies, yet current DP LR methods do not readily support it. Mainstream SDG approaches are either tailored to discretized data, making them less suitable for continuous regression, or rely on deep models that require large datasets, limiting their use for the smaller, continuous data typical in social science. We propose a method for LR with valid inference under Gaussian DP: a DP bias-corrected estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) and a general SDG procedure in which regression on the synthetic data matches our DP regression. Our binning-aggregation strategy is effective in small- to moderate-dimensional settings. Experiments show our method (1) improves accuracy over existing methods, (2) provides valid CIs, and (3) produces more reliable synthetic data for downstream ML tasks than current DP SDGs.",

        "summary": "This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024) demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion, deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.",

Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring, retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL) methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.",

The encoder augments a pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining permutation-invariant to node order.

Traditional approaches face an intractable trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations -- inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations generated using $\\text{STAR-CCM+}^\\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development. Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI) across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit innovation.",

However, existing multimodal methods suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders, utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction tasks.",

To address the aforementioned challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \\ll N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\\mathcal{O}(MN d)$ while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\\%$ accuracy improvement across standard benchmarks.

To address this, we adopt a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with improved interpretability.

We investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively, our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space. Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed unnecessary for regret minimization.

        "summary": "Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections and V cache by nearly 50 \\%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \\% in KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention (MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only 10-15\\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \\% while still improving performance.",

However, existing methods ignore the compute budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem: the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient, significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and language benchmarks.",

Quantization has emerged as an essential compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8, INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting. Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.",

To reduce this burden, open set active learning approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes.

Building on theoretical findings concerning the impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM), SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii) useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes.

(2) Distributed, where one DNN part operates in the vehicle and the other part typically on a large-scale cloud platform with a particular constraint on transmission bitrate efficiency. Typically, both applications share an image and source encoder, while each uses distinct (joint) source and task decoders. Prior work utilized convolutional neural networks for joint source and task decoding but did not investigate transformer-based alternatives such as SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher computational complexity. In this work, we propose joint feature and task decoding for SegDeformer, thereby enabling lower computational complexity in both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames per second (fps) by up to a factor of $11.7$ ($1.4$ fps to $16.5$ fps) on Cityscapes and by up to a factor of $3.5$ ($43.3$ fps to $154.3$ fps) on ADE20K, while being on-par w.r.t.\\ the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of the transformer-based baseline that doesn't compress by a source codec.

        "summary": "The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based frameworks.",

We introduce a Resolution-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences. This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new locations with minimal historical context. Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34% lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset. Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.",

Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \\textit{exact} behavior of the process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions.

On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence.

        "summary": "In many scientific and engineering fields, where acquiring high-quality data is expensive--such as medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing--strategic sampling of unobserved regions based on prior observations is crucial for maximizing discovery rates within a constrained budget. The rise of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations, these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies, our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings. Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains, including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.",

This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein interface features is significantly improved.

Various physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics -- a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.",

        "summary": "Machine unlearning seeks to selectively remove the \"influence\" of specific training data on a model's outputs. The ideal goal is Retrain Equivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the retained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data batches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each stage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM fine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory and experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a fundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the outcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the forget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is influenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it impossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain Equivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM post-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent, NPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms. Models fine-tuned via different orderings of identical training stages diverge in behavior during unlearning, with the degradation in GSM8K accuracy after unlearning varying by over 20% across paths. We also observe that some learning paths consistently produce models that unlearn slowly. During unlearning, whether the probability mass gets squeezed into paraphrasing or alternative concepts is also path-dependent. These results consistently show that Retrain Equivalence is an ill-posed target for local unlearning algorithms, so long as the target models are trained in stages. In situations where access to models' training histories is hard, the current work calls for rethinking the definition and desiderata of machine unlearning.",

However, the theoretical underpinnings of this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is inefficient and requires $\\Omega(\\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.",

Starting from a continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms, where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.",

Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the internal information processing performed by these more complex models.

While LLMs can uniquely learn from language feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we propose \\textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure feedback is effective: \\emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample self-correction and \\emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable lessons from inter-sample experiences.

With the increasing volume and variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP), masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation. Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling (IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features. Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning, demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance, highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization.

Hence, research on life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog, complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models (LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that health condition is the most important determinant across all ages.

        "summary": "Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1) developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations. Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy, they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.",

        "summary": "Modern datasets often contain high-dimensional features exhibiting complex dependencies. To effectively analyze such data, dimensionality reduction methods rely on estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension (id) as a measure of its underlying complexity. However, estimating id is challenging due to its dependence on scale: at very fine scales, noise inflates id estimates, while at coarser scales, estimates stabilize to lower, scale-invariant values. This paper introduces a novel, scalable, and parallelizable method called eDCF, which is based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric, to robustly estimate intrinsic dimension across varying scales. Our method consistently matches leading estimators, achieving comparable values of mean absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples. Moreover, our approach also attains higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates, reaching up to 25.0% compared to 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN, particularly excelling under medium to high noise levels and large datasets. Further, we showcase our method's ability to accurately detect fractal geometries in decision boundaries, confirming its utility for analyzing realistic, structured data.",

Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS) representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS, enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.",

While Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration, enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships.

Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting: when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality, these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80 tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions.

We introduce ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug.

Inspired by Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate the accuracy of the original architecture.

However, the theoretical underpinnings of such compression remain poorly understood. We address this gap by analyzing one-bit quantization in the Random Features model, a simplified framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random features model. Our findings offer theoretical insights into neural network compression. We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit quantization leads to significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related literature.",

While various techniques have been proposed to detect noisy labels, there is no clear consensus on optimal approaches. We perform a comprehensive benchmark of detection methods by decomposing them into three fundamental components: label agreement function, aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs out-of-sample). This decomposition can be applied to many existing detection methods, and enables systematic comparison across diverse approaches. To fairly compare methods, we propose a unified benchmark task, detecting a fraction of training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate. We also introduce a novel metric: the false negative rate at this fixed operating point. Our evaluation spans vision and tabular datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise conditions. We identify that in-sample information gathering using average probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement function achieves the best results across most scenarios.

During the exploration phase, random Rademacher actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics, which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves $\\tilde{\\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges: learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard problem.

        "summary": "A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification, whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments, highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.",

        "summary": "The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at performing certain tasks at \"super-human levels\". This has incentivized the community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics. Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points: (i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered \"saturated\", can be effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.",

While adversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs significant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this work, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by embedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and scale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured transformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and greater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two symmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and equivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that applies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that such models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield tighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme Value for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently improve adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial training. These findings underscore the potential of symmetry-enforcing architectures as efficient and principled alternatives to data augmentation-based defenses.",

While recent works have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i) observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational overhead in the online deployment.",

Based on this perspective, we introduce Nash Merging of Experts (NAMEx), a novel framework that incorporates Nash Bargaining into the merging process, enabling more balanced and efficient collaboration among experts.

Extensive experiments across language modelling, text classification, image classification, and zero-shot robustness under data corruption show that NAMEx consistently outperforms competing methods while integrating seamlessly with popular MoE architectures.

We establish a last-iterate convergence rate for $\\mathbb{E}[\\|Q_k - Q^*\\|_\\infty^2]$, implying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\\epsilon^2)$ for achieving $\\mathbb{E}[\\|Q_k - Q^*\\|_\\infty] \\le \\epsilon$, matching that of off-policy Q-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We also derive an explicit rate for $\\mathbb{E}[\\|Q^{\\pi_k} - Q^*\\|_\\infty^2]$, where $\\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal that on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy counterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an optimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our theory. Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on exploration presents significant analytical challenges. To address these challenges, we employ a refined approach that leverages the Poisson equation to decompose the Markovian noise corresponding to the lazy transition matrix into a martingale-difference term and residual terms. To control the residual terms under time inhomogeneity, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the Poisson equation solution with respect to both the Q-function estimate and the learning policy. These tools may further facilitate the analysis of general reinforcement learning algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies -- such as single-timescale actor--critic methods and learning-in-games algorithms -- and are of independent interest.",

The key principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a wildfire mitigation game.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples / demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.",

Each candidate edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i) Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase, reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected. Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift (measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes, highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code: https://github.com/Bhoy1/STABLE",

Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability. To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework (FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task. Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous, modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate constraint paradigms for representation learning. Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge transfer. Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing modalities.",

In contrast to previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii dynamics.

        "summary": "Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations -- defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs), we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse likelihood as actionable risk scores.",

Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in 4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.",

        "summary": "Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items, significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments. Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations, thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via: https://github.com/SeongKu-Kang/BPL.",

Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides guidance for preliminary stopping decisions.

MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems.

The method utilizes a topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-, 118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales efficiently to large networks.

Leveraging the public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios.

These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often lead to the loss of rich semantic details.",

Quantization, particularly floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant, to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing, which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3 and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16 inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.",

Unlike conventional vector quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time, serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation of grid-like codes in neural systems.",

        "summary": "Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors. Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the performance of GNN-based detectors.",

Moreover, this field still lacks a universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining. Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and powerful tool.",

To overcome this barrier, we propose the information bottleneck (IB)-guided fine-tuning, termed IB-FT, which applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of the code data to compress spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information. Extensive experiments on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1) show that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves top-1 performance (Pass@$1$), and yields far more stable gains under the stricter multi-sample metric Pass@$k^{(m)}$ (a problem counts as solved only if at least $m$ of $k$ samples pass unit tests) compared with conventional FT.",

The problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios. Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of market microstructure and historical features.

With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 \\% of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances.

        "summary": "This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows. Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance, convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments, can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting. In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust, scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be applied to more complex flow configurations.",

Traditional flood management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained disaster response tasks.",

Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2) We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model. (3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.",

When this happens, the predictions of an ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about 50\\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a more informed manner.",

Experiments show that Stratos produces a student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse synthetic data and knowledge injection.

We consider four benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning. Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens algorithmic generalization across domains.",

        "summary": "Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs. Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes $\\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of assistant distributions, and $\\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\\alpha$, which has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant distribution space.",

        "summary": "Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models. Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples. To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems, firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.",

However, reliance on reanalysis data limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning (CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP. Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in global precipitation forecasting.",

The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems.

In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance, ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and target-domain clients.

However, this iterative thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional tokens (e.g., \"Wait\", \"But\") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the continuous-to-discrete projection gap: naïve projections of adversarial embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning (in)efficiency.",

In this work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy, CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and efficiency.

To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use. However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently, overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs. LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with established risk factors for substance use.",

The kinetic modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS as the most accurate.

Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision, although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical overlap.

Existing detection approaches, including MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning. Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of 8.30\\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\\% improvement in accuracy, demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of harmful memes.",

        "summary": "Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality, but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.",

Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases. Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously adapting multimodal learning systems.",

Progress in formal theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that our Lean Finder achieves over $30\\%$ relative improvement compared to previous search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean Finder is available at: https://leanfinder.github.io",

In contrast, SoftMimic enables robots to respond compliantly to external forces while maintaining balance and posture. Our approach leverages an inverse kinematics solver to generate an augmented dataset of feasible compliant motions, which we use to train a reinforcement learning policy. By rewarding the policy for matching compliant responses rather than rigidly tracking the reference motion, SoftMimic learns to absorb disturbances and generalize to varied tasks from a single motion clip. We validate our method through simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating safe and effective interaction with the environment.",

The underlying tensor decomposition is based on the reshaping of the input matrix and its butterfly decomposition into an order $\\mathcal{O} (\\log n)$ tensor. The reshaping of the input matrix into a tensor allows for representation of the butterfly decomposition as a tensor decomposition with dense tensors. This leads to efficient utilization of the existing software infrastructure for dense and sparse tensor computations. We propose two tensor completion algorithms in the butterfly format, using alternating least squares and gradient-based optimization, as well as a novel strategy that uses low-rank matrix completion to efficiently generate an initial guess for the proposed algorithms. To demonstrate the efficiency and applicability of our proposed algorithms, we perform three numerical experiments using simulated oscillatory operators in seismic applications. In these experiments, we use $\\mathcal {O} (n \\log n)$ observed entries in the input matrix and demonstrate an $\\mathcal{O}(n\\log^3 n)$ computational cost of the proposed algorithms, leading to a speedup of orders of magnitudes per iteration for large matrices compared to the low-rank matrix and quantized tensor-train completion. Moreover, the proposed butterfly completion algorithms, equipped with the novel initial guess generation strategy, achieve reconstruction errors that are smaller by an order of magnitude, enabling accurate recovery of the underlying structure compared to the state-of-the-art completion algorithms.",

However, these approaches often rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity.

CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection, with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios.

Despite its several benefits, the classical FL is plagued with several limitations, such as high computational power required for model training(which is critical for low-resource clients), privacy risks, large update traffic, and non-IID heterogeneity. This chapter surveys a hybrid paradigm - Quantum Federated Learning (QFL), which introduces quantum computation, that addresses multiple challenges of classical FL and offers rapid computing capability while keeping the classical orchestration intact. Firstly, we motivate QFL with a concrete presentation on pain points of classical FL, followed by a discussion on a general architecture of QFL frameworks specifying the roles of client and server, communication primitives and the quantum model placement. We classify the existing QFL systems based on four criteria - quantum architecture (pure QFL, hybrid QFL), data processing method (quantum data encoding, quantum feature mapping, and quantum feature selection & dimensionality reduction), network topology (centralized, hierarchial, decentralized), and quantum security mechanisms (quantum key distribution, quantum homomorphic encryption, quantum differential privacy, blind quantum computing). We then describe applications of QFL in healthcare, vehicular networks, wireless networks, and network security, clearly highlighting where QFL improves communication efficiency, security, and performance compared to classical FL. We close with multiple challenges and future works in QFL, including extension of QFL beyond classification tasks, adversarial attacks, realistic hardware deployment, quantum communication protocols deployment, aggregation of different quantum models, and quantum split learning as an alternative to QFL.",

To this end, we propose an automated OOD data augmentation framework named RESample through exploratory sampling. Specifically, we first leverage offline reinforcement learning to obtain an action-value network that accurately identifies sub-optimal actions under the current manipulation policy. We further sample potential OOD states from trajectories via rollout, and design an exploratory sampling mechanism that adaptively incorporates these action proxies into the training dataset to ensure efficiency. Subsequently, our framework explicitly encourages the VLAs to recover from OOD states and enhances their robustness against distributional shifts.

Our framework accommodates non-log-concave distributions, such as Gaussian mixtures, and explicitly accounts for initialization errors, score approximation errors, and effects of discretization via an exponential integrator scheme.

However, existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module, which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert annotations.

        "summary": "Recent advances such as self-consistency and test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) improve the reliability of large language models (LLMs) without additional supervision, yet their underlying mechanisms and statistical guarantees remain poorly understood. We present a unified framework for certifiable inference in LLMs, showing that majority voting provides a statistical certificate of self-consistency: under mild assumptions, the aggregated answer coincides with the mode of the model's terminal distribution with high probability. We derive finite-sample and anytime-valid concentration bounds that quantify this confidence, and introduce the Martingale Majority Certificate (MMC), a sequential stopping rule that adaptively determines when sufficient samples have been drawn. We further prove that label-free post-training methods such as TTRL implicitly sharpen the answer distribution by exponentially tilting it toward its mode, thereby reducing the number of samples required for certification. Building on this insight, we propose new post-training objectives that explicitly optimise this trade-off between sharpness and bias. Together, these results explain and connect two central test-time scaling strategies, self-consistency and TTRL, within a single statistical framework for label-free, certifiable reliability in reasoning LLMs.",

Compared to traditional methods that rely on random sampling within the Bayesian framework, our approach first leverages flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) to efficiently constrain the prior range of physical parameters, and then employs MCMC to accurately infer the posterior distribution. For example, in the orbital parameter inference of beta Pictoris b, our model achieved a substantial speed-up while maintaining comparable accuracy-running 77.8 times faster than Parallel Tempered MCMC (PTMCMC) and 365.4 times faster than nested sampling. Moreover, our FM-MCMC method also attained the highest average log-likelihood among all approaches, demonstrating its superior sampling efficiency and accuracy. This highlights the scalability and efficiency of our approach, making it well-suited for processing the massive datasets expected from future exoplanet surveys. Beyond astrophysics, our methodology establishes a versatile paradigm for synergizing deep generative models with traditional sampling, which can be adopted to tackle complex inference problems in other fields, such as cosmology, biomedical imaging, and particle physics.",

We establish several new results on the complexity of computing the VC-dimension. In particular, given a hypergraph $\\mathcal{H}=(\\mathcal{V},\\mathcal{E})$, we prove that the naive $2^{\\mathcal{O}(|\\mathcal{V}|)}$-time algorithm is asymptotically tight under the Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH). We then prove that the problem admits a 1-additive fixed-parameter approximation algorithm when parameterized by the maximum degree of $\\mathcal{H}$ and a fixed-parameter algorithm when parameterized by its dimension, and that these are essentially the only such exploitable structural parameters. Lastly, we consider a generalization of the problem, formulated using graphs, which captures the VC-dimension of both set systems and graphs. We show that it is fixed-parameter tractable parameterized by the treewidth of the graph (which, in the case of set systems, applies to the treewidth of its incidence graph). In contrast with closely related problems whose dependency on the treewidth is necessarily double-exponential (assuming the ETH), our algorithm has a relatively low dependency on the treewidth.",

Recent 3D integration techniques for VLAs either require specialized sensors and transfer poorly across modalities, or inject weak cues that lack geometry and degrade vision-language alignment. In this work, we introduce FALCON (From Spatial to Action), a novel paradigm that injects rich 3D spatial tokens into the action head. FALCON leverages spatial foundation models to deliver strong geometric priors from RGB alone, and includes an Embodied Spatial Model that can optionally fuse depth, or pose for higher fidelity when available, without retraining or architectural changes. To preserve language reasoning, spatial tokens are consumed by a Spatial-Enhanced Action Head rather than being concatenated into the vision-language backbone. These designs enable FALCON to address limitations in spatial representation, modality transferability, and alignment. In comprehensive evaluations across three simulation benchmarks and eleven real-world tasks, our proposed FALCON achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpasses competitive baselines, and remains robust under clutter, spatial-prompt conditioning, and variations in object scale and height.",

Existing assessments often rely on qualitative descriptions or composite indices, which can mask crucial differences between key domains such as mitigation, adaptation, disaster risk management, and loss and damage. To bridge this gap, we develop a quantitative indicator of climate policy orientation by applying a multilingual transformer-based language model to official national policy documents, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.90 (F1-score). Linking these indicators with World Bank development data in panel regressions reveals that mitigation policies are associated with higher GDP and GNI; disaster risk management correlates with greater GNI and debt but reduced foreign direct investment; adaptation and loss and damage show limited measurable effects. This integrated NLP-econometric framework enables comparable, theme-specific analysis of climate governance, offering a scalable method to monitor progress, evaluate trade-offs, and align policy emphasis with development goals.",

Coupled by their rigidity and unpredictability of learning based control, the ability to safely interact with the environment is missing yet critical. In this work, we present the deployment of a VLA model on a soft continuum manipulator to demonstrate autonomous safe human-robot interaction. We present a structured finetuning and deployment pipeline evaluating two state-of-the-art VLA models (OpenVLA-OFT and $\\pi_0$) across representative manipulation tasks, and show while out-of-the-box policies fail due to embodiment mismatch, through targeted finetuning the soft robot performs equally to the rigid counterpart.

Driven by the privacy concerns of these applications, we study the problem of fixed-confidence BAI under global Differential Privacy (DP) for Bernoulli distributions. While numerous asymptotically optimal BAI algorithms exist in the non-private setting, a significant gap remains between the best lower and upper bounds in the global DP setting. This work reduces this gap to a small multiplicative constant, for any privacy budget $\\epsilon$. First, we provide a tighter lower bound on the expected sample complexity of any $\\delta$-correct and $\\epsilon$-global DP strategy. Our lower bound replaces the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence in the transportation cost used by the non-private characteristic time with a new information-theoretic quantity that optimally trades off between the KL divergence and the Total Variation distance scaled by $\\epsilon$. Second, we introduce a stopping rule based on these transportation costs and a private estimator of the means computed using an arm-dependent geometric batching. En route to proving the correctness of our stopping rule, we derive concentration results of independent interest for the Laplace distribution and for the sum of Bernoulli and Laplace distributions. Third, we propose a Top Two sampling rule based on these transportation costs. For any budget $\\epsilon$, we show an asymptotic upper bound on its expected sample complexity that matches our lower bound to a multiplicative constant smaller than $8$. Our algorithm outperforms existing $\\delta$-correct and $\\epsilon$-global DP BAI algorithms for different values of $\\epsilon$.",

Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework. TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and inter-progression trajectories.

Many former studies have introduced defensive approaches to preclude Quishing such as by classifying the embedded content of QR codes and then label the QR codes accordingly, whereas other studies classify them using visual features (i.e., deep features, histogram density analysis features). However, these approaches mainly rely on black-box techniques which do not clearly provide interpretability and transparency to fully comprehend and reproduce the intrinsic decision process; therefore, having certain obvious limitations includes the approaches' trust, accountability, issues in bias detection, and many more. We proposed QRïS, the pioneer method to classify QR codes through the comprehensive structural analysis of a QR code which helps to identify phishing QR codes beforehand. Our classification method is clearly transparent which makes it reproducible, scalable, and easy to comprehend. First, we generated QR codes dataset (i.e. 400,000 samples) using recently published URLs datasets [1], [2]. Then, unlike black-box models, we developed a simple algorithm to extract 24 structural features from layout patterns present in QR codes. Later, we train the machine learning models on the harvested features and obtained accuracy of up to 83.18%.

Given a hypergraph, hyperedge prediction aims to identify hyperedges that are either missing or likely to form in the future, and it has broad applications, including recommending interest-based social groups, predicting collaborations, and uncovering functional complexes in biological systems. However, the vast search space of hyperedge candidates (i.e., all possible subsets of nodes) poses a significant computational challenge, making naive exhaustive search infeasible. As a result, existing approaches rely on either heuristic sampling to obtain constrained candidate sets or ungrounded assumptions on hypergraph structure to select promising hyperedges. In this work, we propose HyperSearch, a search-based algorithm for hyperedge prediction that efficiently evaluates unconstrained candidate sets, by incorporating two key components: (1) an empirically grounded scoring function derived from observations in real-world hypergraphs and (2) an efficient search mechanism, where we derive and use an anti-monotonic upper bound of the original scoring function (which is not antimonotonic) to prune the search space. This pruning comes with theoretical guarantees, ensuring that discarded candidates are never better than the kept ones w.r.t. the original scoring function. In extensive experiments on 10 real-world hypergraphs across five domains, HyperSearch consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving higher accuracy in predicting new (i.e., not in the training set) hyperedges.",

Our method leverages the representation-learning power of deep neural networks (DNNs) to the task of approximating conditional Fréchet means of the response given the predictors, the metric-space analogue of conditional expectations, by minimizing a Fréchet risk. The framework is highly flexible, accommodating diverse metrics and high-dimensional predictors. We establish a universal approximation theorem for DFNNs, advancing the state-of-the-art of neural network approximation theory to general metric-space-valued responses without making model assumptions or relying on local smoothing. Empirical studies on synthetic distributional and network-valued responses, as well as a real-world application to predicting employment occupational compositions, demonstrate that DFNNs consistently outperform existing methods.",

        "summary": "Regret matching (RM} -- and its modern variants -- is a foundational online algorithm that has been at the heart of many AI breakthrough results in solving benchmark zero-sum games, such as poker. Yet, surprisingly little is known so far in theory about its convergence beyond two-player zero-sum games. For example, whether regret matching converges to Nash equilibria in potential games has been an open problem for two decades. Even beyond games, one could try to use RM variants for general constrained optimization problems. Recent empirical evidence suggests that they -- particularly regret matching$^+$ (RM$^+$) -- attain strong performance on benchmark constrained optimization problems, outperforming traditional gradient descent-type algorithms. We show that alternating RM$^+$ converges to an $\\epsilon$-KKT point after $O_\\epsilon(1/\\epsilon^4)$ iterations, establishing for the first time that it is a sound and fast first-order optimizer. Our argument relates the KKT gap to the accumulated regret, two quantities that are entirely disparate in general but interact in an intriguing way in our setting, so much so that when regrets are bounded, our complexity bound improves all the way to $O_\\epsilon(1/\\epsilon^2)$. From a technical standpoint, while RM$^+$ does not have the usual one-step improvement property in general, we show that it does in a certain region that the algorithm will quickly reach and remain in thereafter. In sharp contrast, our second main result establishes a lower bound: RM, with or without alternation, can take an exponential number of iterations to reach a crude approximate solution even in two-player potential games. This represents the first worst-case separation between RM and RM$^+$. Our lower bound shows that convergence to coarse correlated equilibria in potential games is exponentially faster than convergence to Nash equilibria.",

        "summary": "Mean-field variational inference (MFVI) is a widely used method for approximating high-dimensional probability distributions by product measures. It has been empirically observed that MFVI optimizers often suffer from mode collapse. Specifically, when the target measure $\\pi$ is a mixture $\\pi = w P_0 + (1 - w) P_1$, the MFVI optimizer tends to place most of its mass near a single component of the mixture. This work provides the first theoretical explanation of mode collapse in MFVI. We introduce the notion to capture the separatedness of the two mixture components -- called $\\varepsilon$-separateness -- and derive explicit bounds on the fraction of mass that any MFVI optimizer assigns to each component when $P_0$ and $P_1$ are $\\varepsilon$-separated for sufficiently small $\\varepsilon$. Our results suggest that the occurrence of mode collapse crucially depends on the relative position of the components. To address this issue, we propose the rotational variational inference (RoVI), which augments MFVI with a rotation matrix. The numerical studies support our theoretical findings and demonstrate the benefits of RoVI.",

        "summary": "Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in substantial computational overhead during both training and inference. Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this \"thinking\" process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel, theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced by 58.6% compared to the RL model.",

To address this challenge, we study sample sharing in the case of ridge regression: leveraging an auxiliary data set while explicitly protecting against negative transfer. We introduce a principled, data-driven rule that decides how many samples from an auxiliary dataset to add to the target training set. The rule is based on an estimate of the transfer gain i.e. the marginal reduction in the predictive error. Building on this estimator, we derive finite-sample guaranties: under standard conditions, the procedure borrows when it improves parameter estimation and abstains otherwise. In the Gaussian feature setting, we analyze which data set properties ensure that borrowing samples reduces the predictive error. We validate the approach in synthetic and real datasets, observing consistent gains over strong baselines and single-task training while avoiding negative transfer.",

This was exemplified by the landmark achievement of AlphaFold (Jumper et al. (2021)). In this paper, we study how ML predictions can be safely used in statistical analysis of data towards scientific discovery. In particular, we follow the framework introduced by Angelopoulos et al. (2023). In this framework, we assume access to a small set of $n$ gold-standard labeled samples, a much larger set of $N$ unlabeled samples, and a ML model that can be used to impute the labels of the unlabeled data points. We introduce two new learning-augmented estimators: (1) Prediction-Augmented Residual Tree (PART), and (2) Prediction-Augmented Quadrature (PAQ). Both estimators have significant advantages over existing estimators like PPI and PPI++ introduced by Angelopoulos et al. (2023) and Angelopoulos et al. (2024), respectively. PART is a decision-tree based estimator built using a greedy criterion. We first characterize PART's asymptotic distribution and demonstrate how to construct valid confidence intervals. Then we show that PART outperforms existing methods in real-world datasets from ecology, astronomy, and census reports, among other domains. This leads to estimators with higher confidence, which is the result of using both the gold-standard samples and the machine learning predictions. Finally, we provide a formal proof of the advantage of PART by exploring PAQ, an estimation that arises when considering the limit of PART when the depth its tree grows to infinity. Under appropriate assumptions in the input data we show that the variance of PAQ shrinks at rate of $O(N^{-1} + n^{-4})$, improving significantly on the $O(N^{-1}+n^{-1})$ rate of existing methods.",

Instead, we demonstrate how to prompt LLMs to express their internal confidence in a way that is sufficiently calibrated to enable effective adversarial optimization. We apply our general method to three attack scenarios: adversarial examples for vision-LLMs, jailbreaks and prompt injections. Our attacks successfully generate malicious inputs against systems that only expose textual outputs, thereby dramatically expanding the attack surface for deployed LLMs. We further find that better and larger models exhibit superior calibration when expressing confidence, creating a concerning security paradox where model capability improvements directly enhance vulnerability.

        "summary": "LLM-powered coding agents, which operate in iterative loops (turns) to solve software engineering tasks, are becoming increasingly powerful. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant and unpredictable costs. This challenge arises from a combination of factors: quadratically growing token counts with each turn, the high price of models, the large number of turns required for real-world tasks, and the tendency of agents to take inefficient or unnecessary actions. While existing research focuses on optimizing individual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an underexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three state-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control strategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a novel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand. Our findings first reveal a fundamental trade-off in the unrestricted setting, where no single model excels across performance, cost, and turn efficiency. We then show that a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline, serves as a \"sweet spot\", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with minimal impact on solve rates. Most significantly, the dynamic-turn strategy consistently outperforms fixed-limit approaches, achieving comparable or better solve rates while further reducing costs by an additional 12%-24% by intelligently allocating resources only to tasks that need them. This work provides the first systematic analysis of turn-control strategies, offering simple yet effective guidelines for developers to balance cost and efficacy. We demonstrate that dynamic resource allocation is a superior, easy-to-implement approach for deploying powerful yet economically viable coding agents.",

The system leverages concepts from control theory, reinforcement learning, and multi-armed bandit optimization to achieve both short-term responsiveness and long-term stability. Rather than relying on explicit PID regulation, the framework applies generalized feedback-based adaptation, ensuring that corrective actions remain proportional to observed performance deviations and the computed gateway score gradually converges toward the success rate. This hybrid approach unifies control theory and adaptive decision systems, enabling self-regulating transaction routing that dampens instability, and improves reliability. Live production results show an improvement of up to 1.15% in success rate over traditional rule-based routing, demonstrating the effectiveness of feedback-based control in payment systems.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across diverse tasks, but fine-tuning them typically relies on cloud-based, centralized infrastructures. This requires data owners to upload potentially sensitive data to external servers, raising serious privacy concerns. An alternative approach is to fine-tune LLMs directly on edge devices using local data; however, this introduces a new challenge: the model owner must transfer proprietary models to the edge, which risks intellectual property (IP) leakage. To address this dilemma, we propose DistilLock, a TEE-assisted fine-tuning framework that enables privacy-preserving knowledge distillation on the edge. In DistilLock, a proprietary foundation model is executed within a trusted execution environment (TEE) enclave on the data owner's device, acting as a secure black-box teacher. This setup preserves both data privacy and model IP by preventing direct access to model internals. Furthermore, DistilLock employs a model obfuscation mechanism to offload obfuscated weights to untrusted accelerators for efficient knowledge distillation without compromising security. We demonstrate that DistilLock prevents unauthorized knowledge distillation processes and model-stealing attacks while maintaining high computational efficiency, but offering a secure and practical solution for edge-based LLM personalization.",

        "summary": "Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines even without domain supervision.

These relationships provide both an accurate characterization of the prior predictive distribution and enable the use of GP machinery to improve the uncertainty quantification of deep neural networks. In this work, we extend this connection to neural operators (NOs), a class of models designed to learn mappings between function spaces. Specifically, we show conditions for when arbitrary-depth NOs with Gaussian-distributed convolution kernels converge to function-valued GPs. Based on this result, we show how to compute the covariance functions of these NO-GPs for two NO parametrizations, including the popular Fourier neural operator (FNO). With this, we compute the posteriors of these GPs in regression scenarios, including PDE solution operators. This work is an important step towards uncovering the inductive biases of current FNO architectures and opens a path to incorporate novel inductive biases for use in kernel-based operator learning methods.",

        "summary": "We consider a natural dynamic staffing problem in which a decision-maker sequentially hires workers over a finite horizon to meet an unknown demand revealed at the end. Predictions about demand arrive over time and become increasingly accurate, while worker availability decreases. This creates a fundamental trade-off between hiring early to avoid understaffing (when workers are more available but forecasts are less reliable) and hiring late to avoid overstaffing (when forecasts are more accurate but availability is lower). This problem is motivated by last-mile delivery operations, where companies such as Amazon rely on gig-economy workers whose availability declines closer to the operating day. To address practical limitations of Bayesian models (in particular, to remain agnostic to the underlying forecasting method), we study this problem under adversarial predictions. In this model, sequential predictions are adversarially chosen uncertainty intervals that (approximately) contain the true demand. The objective is to minimize worst-case staffing imbalance cost. Our main result is a simple and computationally efficient online algorithm that is minimax optimal. We first characterize the minimax cost against a restricted adversary via a polynomial-size linear program, then show how to emulate this solution in the general case. While our base model focuses on a single demand, we extend the framework to multiple demands (with egalitarian/utilitarian objectives), to settings with costly reversals of hiring decisions, and to inconsistent prediction intervals. We also introduce a practical \"re-solving\" variant of our algorithm, which we prove is also minimax optimal. Finally we conduct numerical experiments showing that our algorithms outperform Bayesian heuristics in both cost and speed, and are competitive with (approximate or exact) Bayesian-optimal policies when those can be computed.",

Despite the growing body of work in specialized visualization retrieval systems, a systematic approach to understanding visualization similarity remains absent. We introduce the Similarity Framework for Visualization Retrieval (Safire), a conceptual model that frames visualization similarity along two dimensions: comparison criteria and representation modalities. Comparison criteria identify the aspects that make visualizations similar, which we divide into primary facets (data, visual encoding, interaction, style, metadata) and derived properties (data-centric and human-centric measures). Safire connects what to compare with how comparisons are executed through representation modalities. We categorize existing representation approaches into four groups based on their levels of information content and visualization determinism: raster image, vector image, specification, and natural language description, together guiding what is computable and comparable. We analyze several visualization retrieval systems using Safire to demonstrate its practical value in clarifying similarity considerations. Our findings reveal how particular criteria and modalities align across different use cases. Notably, the choice of representation modality is not only an implementation detail but also an important decision that shapes retrieval capabilities and limitations. Based on our analysis, we provide recommendations and discuss broader implications for multimodal learning, AI applications, and visualization reproducibility.",

        "summary": "We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance, we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset, but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.",

In this paper, we investigate ways to modify this synthetic retraining process to avoid model collapse, and even possibly help reverse the trend from collapse to improvement. Our key finding is that by injecting information through an external synthetic data verifier, whether a human or a better model, synthetic retraining will not cause model collapse. To develop principled understandings of the above insight, we situate our analysis in the foundational linear regression setting, showing that iterative retraining with verified synthetic data can yield near-term improvements but ultimately drives the parameter estimate to the verifier's \"knowledge center\" in the long run. Our theory hence predicts that, unless the verifier is perfectly reliable, the early gains will plateau and may even reverse. Indeed, these theoretical insights are further confirmed by our experiments on both linear regression as well as Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) trained on MNIST data.",

        "summary": "Modern scientific and engineering design increasingly involves distributed optimization, where agents such as laboratories, simulations, or industrial partners pursue related goals under differing conditions. These agents often face heterogeneities in objectives, evaluation budgets, and accessible design variables, which complicates coordination and can lead to redundancy, poor resource use, and ineffective information sharing. Bayesian Optimization (BO) is a widely used decision-making framework for expensive black box functions, but its single-agent formulation assumes centralized control and full data sharing. Recent collaborative BO methods relax these assumptions, yet they often require uniform resources, fully shared input spaces, and fixed task alignment, conditions rarely satisfied in practice. To address these challenges, we introduce Adaptive Resource Aware Collaborative Bayesian Optimization (ARCO-BO), a framework that explicitly accounts for heterogeneity in multi-agent optimization. ARCO-BO combines three components: a similarity and optima-aware consensus mechanism for adaptive information sharing, a budget-aware asynchronous sampling strategy for resource coordination, and a partial input space sharing for heterogeneous design spaces. Experiments on synthetic and high-dimensional engineering problems show that ARCO-BO consistently outperforms independent BO and existing collaborative BO via consensus approach, achieving robust and efficient performance in complex multi-agent settings.",

For white-box attacks on image classifiers, we introduce the Overlapping Smoothed L0 (OSL0) function, which promotes convergence to a stationary point while encouraging sparse, structured perturbations. By grouping channels and adjacent pixels, ATOS improves interpretability and helps identify robust versus non-robust features. We approximate the L-infinity gradient using the logarithm of the sum of exponential absolute values to tightly control perturbation magnitude. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, ATOS achieves a 100% attack success rate while producing significantly sparser and more structurally coherent perturbations than prior methods. The structured group-wise attack highlights critical regions from the network's perspective, providing counterfactual explanations by replacing class-defining regions with robust features from the target class.",

MSBM extends iterative Markovian fitting (IMF) to effectively handle multiple marginal constraints. This technique ensures robust enforcement of all intermediate marginals while preserving the continuity of the learned global dynamics across the entire trajectory.

Model performance is assessed through agreement with human annotations and predictive validity for customer ratings. Results show high consistency between LLMs and human coders and strong predictive validity, confirming the reliability of the approach. Human coders required a median of six minutes per review, whereas the LLM processed each in two seconds, delivering comparable insights at a scale unattainable through manual coding. Managerially, the analysis identifies attributes and features that most strongly influence customer satisfaction and their associated sentiments, enabling firms to pinpoint \"joy points,\" address \"pain points,\" and design targeted interventions. We demonstrate how structured review data can power an actionable marketing dashboard that tracks sentiment over time and across stores, benchmarks performance, and highlights high-leverage features for improvement. Simulations indicate that enhancing sentiment for key service features could yield 1-2% average revenue gains per store.",

While genomic and electrophysiological data such as SNP variants and ECG phenotypes are increasingly accessible, effectively integrating these modalities in low-label settings is non-trivial. This challenge arises from the scarcity of well-annotated multimodal datasets and the high dimensionality of biological signals, which limit the effectiveness of conventional supervised models. To address this, we present a few-label multimodal framework that leverages large language models (LLMs) to combine genetic and electrophysiological information for cardiovascular risk stratification. Our approach incorporates a pseudo-label refinement strategy to adaptively distill high-confidence labels from weakly supervised predictions, enabling robust model fine-tuning with only a small set of ground-truth annotations. To enhance the interpretability, we frame the task as a Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning problem, prompting the model to produce clinically relevant rationales alongside predictions. Experimental results demonstrate that the integration of multimodal inputs, few-label supervision, and CoT reasoning improves robustness and generalizability across diverse patient profiles. Experimental results using multimodal SNP variants and ECG-derived features demonstrated comparable performance to models trained on the full dataset, underscoring the promise of LLM-based few-label multimodal modeling for advancing personalized cardiovascular care.",

Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card, 1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000), exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020; Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024).

        "summary": "This paper presents a novel framework for speech transcription and synthesis, leveraging edge-cloud parallelism to enhance processing speed and accessibility for Kinyarwanda and Swahili speakers. It addresses the scarcity of powerful language processing tools for these widely spoken languages in East African countries with limited technological infrastructure. The framework utilizes the Whisper and SpeechT5 pre-trained models to enable speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) translation. The architecture uses a cascading mechanism that distributes the model inference workload between the edge device and the cloud, thereby reducing latency and resource usage, benefiting both ends. On the edge device, our approach achieves a memory usage compression of 9.5% for the SpeechT5 model and 14% for the Whisper model, with a maximum memory usage of 149 MB. Experimental results indicate that on a 1.7 GHz CPU edge device with a 1 MB/s network bandwidth, the system can process a 270-character text in less than a minute for both speech-to-text and text-to-speech transcription. Using real-world survey data from Kenya, it is shown that the cascaded edge-cloud architecture proposed could easily serve as an excellent platform for STT and TTS transcription with good accuracy and response time.",

        "summary": "In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive. Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning.

Building on these conditions, we introduce novel loss functions and design a neural network architecture to estimate nuisance parameters and obtain robust estimation of relative error, thereby achieving reliable evaluation of HTE estimators. We provide the large sample properties of the proposed relative error estimator. Furthermore, beyond evaluation, we propose a new learning algorithm for HTE that leverages both the previously HTE estimators and the nuisance parameters learned through our neural network architecture.

        "summary": "In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the frequent transmission of large amounts of data over wireless networks should meet the stringent timeliness requirements. Particularly, the freshness of packet status updates has a significant impact on the system performance. In this paper, we propose an age-of-information (AoI)-aware multi-base station (BS) real-time monitoring framework to support extensive IIoT deployments. To meet the freshness requirements of IIoT, we formulate a joint task offloading and resource allocation optimization problem with the goal of minimizing long-term average AoI. Tackling the core challenges of combinatorial explosion in multi-BS decision spaces and the stochastic dynamics of IIoT systems is crucial, as these factors render traditional optimization methods intractable. Firstly, an innovative branching-based Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (Branching-D3QN) algorithm is proposed to effectively implement task offloading, which optimizes the convergence performance by reducing the action space complexity from exponential to linear levels. Then, an efficient optimization solution to resource allocation is proposed by proving the semi-definite property of the Hessian matrix of bandwidth and computation resources. Finally, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm for efficient joint task offloading and resource allocation to achieve optimal average AoI performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed Branching-D3QN algorithm outperforms both state-of-the-art DRL methods and classical heuristics, achieving up to a 75% enhanced convergence speed and at least a 22% reduction in the long-term average AoI.",

Our exploration involves a large-scale training dataset in which dense neural representations of MS-MARCO queries and passages are complemented and integrated with 253 hand-crafted lexical features extracted from the same corpus. Blending of the relevance signals from the two different groups of features is learned by a classical Learning-to-Rank (LTR) model based on a forest of decision trees. To evaluate our solution, we employ a pipelined architecture where a dense neural retriever serves as the first stage and performs a nearest-neighbor search over the neural representations of the documents. Our LTR model acts instead as the second stage that re-ranks the set of candidates retrieved by the first stage to enhance effectiveness. The results of reproducible experiments conducted with state-of-the-art dense retrievers on publicly available resources show that the proposed solution significantly enhances the end-to-end ranking performance while relatively minimally impacting efficiency. Specifically, we achieve a boost in nDCG@10 of up to 11% with an increase in average query latency of only 4.3%. This confirms the advantage of seamlessly combining two distinct families of signals that mutually contribute to retrieval effectiveness.",

We curated a self-annotated dataset of over 7,000 dashcam frames capturing diverse Indian road conditions, weather patterns, and lighting scenarios, which we used to fine-tune the Ultralytics YOLO model for accurate pothole detection. The system synchronizes OCR-extracted video timestamps with external GPS logs to precisely geolocate each detected pothole, enriching detections with comprehensive metadata, including road segment attribution and contractor information managed through an optimized backend database. iWatchRoadv2 introduces intelligent governance features that enable authorities to link road segments with contract metadata through a secure login interface. The system automatically sends alerts to contractors and officials when road health deteriorates, supporting automated accountability and warranty enforcement. The intuitive web interface delivers actionable analytics to stakeholders and the public, facilitating evidence-driven repair planning, budget allocation, and quality assessment. Our cost-effective and scalable solution streamlines frame processing and storage while supporting seamless public engagement for urban and rural deployments.

        "summary": "From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact, learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable. Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for such users to align the algorithm with their true interests? To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users, specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal (e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.",

        "summary": "A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning (SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT, boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs, Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs, a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at https://june-page.github.io/pivot/",

In this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5, while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.",

        "summary": "Algorithm unrolling methods have proven powerful for solving the regularized least squares problem in computational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These approaches unfold an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations, typically alternating between a neural network-based proximal operator for regularization, a data fidelity operation and auxiliary updates with learnable parameters. While the connection to optimization methods dictate that the proximal operator network should be shared across unrolls, this can introduce artifacts or blurring. Heuristically, practitioners have shown that using distinct networks may be beneficial, but this significantly increases the number of learnable parameters, making it challenging to prevent overfitting. To address these shortcomings, by taking inspirations from proximal operators with varying thresholds in approximate message passing (AMP) and the success of time-embedding in diffusion models, we propose a time-embedded algorithm unrolling scheme for inverse problems. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective on the iteration-dependent proximal operation in vector AMP (VAMP) and the subsequent Onsager correction in the context of algorithm unrolling, framing them as a time-embedded neural network. Similarly, the scalar weights in the data fidelity operation and its associated Onsager correction are cast as time-dependent learnable parameters. Our extensive experiments on the fastMRI dataset, spanning various acceleration rates and datasets, demonstrate that our method effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our time-embedding strategy extends to existing algorithm unrolling approaches, enhancing reconstruction quality without increasing the computational complexity significantly.",

        "summary": "Reasoning Vision Language Action (VLA) models improve robotic instruction-following by generating step-by-step textual plans before low-level actions, an approach inspired by Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in language models. Yet even with a correct textual plan, the generated actions can still miss the intended outcomes in the plan, especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. We formalize this phenomenon as a lack of embodied CoT faithfulness, and introduce a training-free, runtime policy steering method for reasoning-action alignment. Given a reasoning VLA's intermediate textual plan, our framework samples multiple candidate action sequences from the same model, predicts their outcomes via simulation, and uses a pre-trained Vision-Language Model (VLM) to select the sequence whose outcome best aligns with the VLA's own textual plan. Only executing action sequences that align with the textual reasoning turns our base VLA's natural action diversity from a source of error into a strength, boosting robustness to semantic and visual OOD perturbations and enabling novel behavior composition without costly re-training. We also contribute a reasoning-annotated extension of LIBERO-100, environment variations tailored for OOD evaluation, and demonstrate up to 15% performance gain over prior work on behavior composition tasks and scales with compute and data diversity.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work, we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without degrading agentic system performance.",

However, many applications require strong properties besides valid inference, such as privacy, robustness or validity under continuous distribution shifts; deriving prediction-powered methods with such guarantees is generally an arduous process, and has to be done case by case. In this paper, we resolve this issue by connecting prediction-powered inference with conformal prediction: by performing imputation through a calibrated conformal set-predictor, we attain validity while achieving additional guarantees in a natural manner. We instantiate our procedure for the inference of means, Z- and M-estimation, as well as e-values and e-value-based procedures. Furthermore, in the case of e-values, ours is the first general prediction-powered procedure that operates off-line. We demonstrate these advantages by applying our method on private and time-series data. Both tasks are nontrivial within the standard prediction-powered framework but become natural under our method.",

        "summary": "The ratio of two probability density functions is a fundamental quantity that appears in many areas of statistics and machine learning, including causal inference, reinforcement learning, covariate shift, outlier detection, independence testing, importance sampling, and diffusion modeling. Naively estimating the numerator and denominator densities separately using, e.g., kernel density estimators, can lead to unstable performance and suffers from the curse of dimensionality as the number of covariates increases. For this reason, several methods have been developed for estimating the density ratio directly based on (a) Bregman divergences or (b) recasting the density ratio as the odds in a probabilistic classification model that predicts whether an observation is sampled from the numerator or denominator distribution. Additionally, the density ratio can be viewed as the Riesz representer of a continuous linear map, making it amenable to estimation via (c) minimization of the so-called Riesz loss, which was developed to learn the Riesz representer in the Riesz regression procedure in causal inference. In this paper we show that all three of these methods can be unified in a common framework, which we call Bregman-Riesz regression. We further show how data augmentation techniques can be used to apply density ratio learning methods to causal problems, where the numerator distribution typically represents an unobserved intervention. We show through simulations how the choice of Bregman divergence and data augmentation strategy can affect the performance of the resulting density ratio learner. A Python package is provided for researchers to apply Bregman-Riesz regression in practice using gradient boosting, neural networks, and kernel methods.",

        "summary": "Cancer exhibits diverse and complex phenotypes driven by multifaceted molecular interactions. Recent biomedical research has emphasized the comprehensive study of such diseases by integrating multi-omics datasets (genome, proteome, transcriptome, epigenome). This approach provides an efficient method for identifying genetic variants associated with cancer and offers a deeper understanding of how the disease develops and spreads. However, it is challenging to comprehend complex interactions among the features of multi-omics datasets compared to single omics. In this paper, we analyze lung cancer multi-omics datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Using four statistical methods, LIMMA, the T test, Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA), and the Wilcoxon test, we identified differentially expressed genes across gene expression, DNA methylation, and miRNA expression data. We then integrated these multi-omics data using the Kernel Machine Regression (KMR) approach. Our findings reveal significant interactions among the three omics: gene expression, miRNA expression, and DNA methylation in lung cancer. From our data analysis, we identified 38 genes significantly associated with lung cancer. From our data analysis, we identified 38 genes significantly associated with lung cancer. Among these, eight genes of highest ranking (PDGFRB, PDGFRA, SNAI1, ID1, FGF11, TNXB, ITGB1, ZIC1) were highlighted by rigorous statistical analysis. Furthermore, in silico studies identified three top-ranked potential candidate drugs (Selinexor, Orapred, and Capmatinib) that could play a crucial role in the treatment of lung cancer. These proposed drugs are also supported by the findings of other independent studies, which underscore their potential efficacy in the fight against lung cancer.",

Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.",

Applied to Salmonella enterica RNA-seq data, CITE V.1 generated biologically meaningful insights supported by the literature, while an LLM-only Gemini baseline frequently produced speculative results with false citations.

        "summary": "This paper argues that website owners have the right to exclude others from their websites. Accordingly, when generative AI (GenAI) scraping bots intentionally circumvent reasonable technological barriers, their conduct could be actionable as trespass to chattels. If the scraping leads to a decrease in the website's value, then trespass to chattels should apply. The prevailing judicial focus on website content and the dismissal of trespass claims absent proof of server impairment or user disruption misconstrues the nature of the website itself as a form of digital property, focusing too narrowly on what constitutes harm under a claim of trespass. By shifting analysis from content to the website itself as an integrated digital asset and illustrating the harm to the value of the chattel, this paper demonstrates that the right to exclude applies online with the same force as it does to tangible property. Courts and litigants have struggled to police large-scale scraping because copyright preemption narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair use defense as the primary battleground. In contrast, recognizing websites as personal property revives trespass to chattels as a meaningful cause of action, providing website owners with an enforceable exclusionary right. Such protection would disincentivize exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for content creation, aid in protecting privacy and personal data, and safeguard values of autonomy and expression. Ultimately, this paper contends that reaffirming website owners' right to exclude is essential to maintaining a fair and sustainable online environment.",

To address this issue, the present paper puts forward a proposal for an intelligent detection method for system logs based on Genera- tive Pre-trained Transformers (GPT). The efficacy of this approach is attributable to a combination of structured input design and a Focal Loss op- timization strategy, which collectively result in a substantial enhancement of the performance of log anomaly detection. The initial approach involves the conversion of raw logs into event ID sequences through the use of the Drain parser. Subsequently, the Focal Loss loss function is employed to address the issue of class imbalance. The experimental re- sults demonstrate that the optimized GPT-2 model significantly outperforms the unoptimized model in a range of key metrics, including precision, recall, and F1 score.

However, the development of models capable of predicting extreme weather has been constrained by the coarse resolution (1-2 km) of existing public radar datasets, such as SEVIR, HKO-7, and GridRad-Severe, which smooth the fine-scale structures essential for accurate forecasting. To address this gap, we introduce Storm250-L2, a storm-centric radar dataset derived from NEXRAD Level-II and GridRad-Severe data. We algorithmically crop a fixed, high-resolution (250 m) window around GridRad-Severe storm tracks, preserve the native polar geometry, and provide temporally consistent sequences of both per-tilt sweeps and a pseudo-composite reflectivity product. The dataset comprises thousands of storm events across the continental United States, packaged in HDF5 tensors with rich context metadata and reproducible manifests.",

        "summary": "Neural networks increasingly run on hardware outside the user's control (cloud GPUs, inference marketplaces). Yet ML-as-a-Service reveals little about what actually ran or whether returned outputs faithfully reflect the intended inputs. Users lack recourse against service downgrades (model swaps, quantization, graph rewrites, or discrepancies like altered ad embeddings). Verifying outputs is hard because floating-point(FP) execution on heterogeneous accelerators is inherently nondeterministic. Existing approaches are either impractical for real FP neural networks or reintroduce vendor trust. We present NAO: a Nondeterministic tolerance Aware Optimistic verification protocol that accepts outputs within principled operator-level acceptance regions rather than requiring bitwise equality. NAO combines two error models: (i) sound per-operator IEEE-754 worst-case bounds and (ii) tight empirical percentile profiles calibrated across hardware. Discrepancies trigger a Merkle-anchored, threshold-guided dispute game that recursively partitions the computation graph until one operator remains, where adjudication reduces to a lightweight theoretical-bound check or a small honest-majority vote against empirical thresholds. Unchallenged results finalize after a challenge window, without requiring trusted hardware or deterministic kernels. We implement NAO as a PyTorch-compatible runtime and a contract layer currently deployed on Ethereum Holesky testnet. The runtime instruments graphs, computes per-operator bounds, and runs unmodified vendor kernels in FP32 with negligible overhead (0.3% on Qwen3-8B). Across CNNs, Transformers and diffusion models on A100, H100, RTX6000, RTX4090, empirical thresholds are $10^2-10^3$ times tighter than theoretical bounds, and bound-aware adversarial attacks achieve 0% success. NAO reconciles scalability with verifiability for real-world heterogeneous ML compute.",

Existing defenses focus on static code analysis, public mempool screening, attacker contract detection, or trusted off-chain monitors, none of which prevents exploits submitted through private relays or malicious contracts that execute within the same block. We present the first decentralized, fully on-chain learning framework that: (i) performs gas-prohibitive computation on Layer-2 to reduce cost, (ii) propagates verified model updates to Layer-1, and (iii) enables gas-bounded, low-latency inference inside smart contracts. A novel Proof-of-Improvement (PoIm) protocol governs the training process and verifies each decentralized micro update as a self-verifying training transaction. Updates are accepted by \\textit{PoIm} only if they demonstrably improve at least one core metric (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, precision, or recall) on a public benchmark without degrading any of the other core metrics, while adversarial proposals get financially penalized through an adaptable test set for evolving threats. We develop quantization and loop-unrolling techniques that enable inference for logistic regression, SVM, MLPs, CNNs, and gated RNNs (with support for formally verified decision tree inference) within the Ethereum block gas limit, while remaining bit-exact to their off-chain counterparts, formally proven in Z3.

        "summary": "Nanopore sequencing enables real-time long-read DNA sequencing with reads exceeding 10 kilobases, but inherent error rates of 12-15 percent present significant computational challenges for read alignment. The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.",

However, current training pipelines primarily rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics.

At its core is SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary baselines.",

The results reveal novel insights into traditional market theories when applied to the Philippine Stock Exchange using the Kalman method and maximum likelihood estimation, with subsequent validation against the capital asset pricing model. Notably, a one-factor model extracts a common factor representing systematic or market dynamics similar to the composite index, whereas a two-factor model extracts common factors representing market trends and volatility. Furthermore, an application of the model for nowcasting the growth rates of the Philippine gross domestic product highlights the potential of the extracted common factors as viable real-time market indicators, yielding over a 34% decrease in the out-of-sample prediction error.

We present \\textbf{TeLLMe}, the first table-lookup-based ternary LLM accelerator for low-power edge FPGAs that fully supports both prefill and autoregressive decoding using 1.58-bit weights and 8-bit activations. TeLLMe incorporates several novel techniques, including (1) a table-lookup-based ternary matrix multiplication (TLMM) engine utilizing grouped activations and online precomputation for low resource utilization and high throughput; (2) a fine-grained analytic URAM-based weight buffer management scheme for efficient loading and compute engine access; (3) a streaming dataflow architecture that fuses floating-point element-wise operations with linear computations to hide latency; (4) a reversed-reordered prefill stage attention with fused attention operations for high memory efficiency; and (5) a resource-efficient specialized decoding stage attention. Under a 5~W power budget, TeLLMe delivers up to 25~tokens/s decoding throughput and 0.45--0.96~s time-to-first-token (TTFT) for 64--128 token prompts, marking a significant energy-efficiency advancement in LLM inference on edge FPGAs.",

As traditional semiconductor scaling slows, high-speed interconnects have emerged as the new scaling engine, enabling the creation of larger logical GPUs by linking many GPUs into a single, low-latency, high-bandwidth compute domain. While initial scale-up fabrics leveraged copper interconnects for their power and cost advantages, the maximum reach of passive electrical interconnects (approximately 1 meter) effectively limits the scale-up domain to within a single rack. The advent of 3D-stacked optics and logic offers a transformative, power-efficient scale-up solution for connecting hundreds of GPU packages (thousands of GPUs) across multiple data center racks. This work explores the design tradeoffs of scale-up technologies and demonstrates how frontier LLMs necessitate novel photonic solutions to achieve aggressive power and performance targets. We model the benefits of 3D CPO (Passage) enabled GPUs and switches within the scale-up domain when training Frontier Mixture of Experts (MoE) models exceeding one trillion parameters. Our results show that the substantial increases in bandwidth and radix enabled by 3D CPO allow for an 8X increase in scale-up capability. This affords new opportunities for multi-dimensional parallelism within the scale-up domain and results in a 2.7X reduction in time-to-train, unlocking unprecedented model scaling.",

        "summary": "Traditional stochastic control methods in finance struggle in real world markets due to their reliance on simplifying assumptions and stylized frameworks. Such methods typically perform well in specific, well defined environments but yield suboptimal results in changed, non stationary ones. We introduce FinFlowRL, a novel framework for financial optimal stochastic control. The framework pretrains an adaptive meta policy learning from multiple expert strategies, then finetunes through reinforcement learning in the noise space to optimize the generative process. By employing action chunking generating action sequences rather than single decisions, it addresses the non Markovian nature of markets. FinFlowRL consistently outperforms individually optimized experts across diverse market conditions.",

        "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) continue to scale, multi-node deployment has become a necessity. Consequently, communication has become a critical performance bottleneck. Current intra-node communication libraries, like NCCL, typically make use of a single interconnect such as NVLink. This approach creates performance ceilings, especially on hardware like the H800 GPU where the primary interconnect's bandwidth can become a bottleneck, and leaves other hardware resources like PCIe and Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA)-capable Network Interface Cards (NICs) largely idle during intensive workloads. We propose FlexLink, the first collective communication framework to the best of our knowledge designed to systematically address this by aggregating these heterogeneous links-NVLink, PCIe, and RDMA NICs-into a single, high-performance communication fabric. FlexLink employs an effective two-stage adaptive load balancing strategy that dynamically partitions communication traffic across all available links, ensuring that faster interconnects are not throttled by slower ones. On an 8-GPU H800 server, our design improves the bandwidth of collective operators such as AllReduce and AllGather by up to 26% and 27% over the NCCL baseline, respectively. This gain is achieved by offloading 2-22% of the total communication traffic to the previously underutilized PCIe and RDMA NICs. FlexLink provides these improvements as a lossless, drop-in replacement compatible with the NCCL API, ensuring easy adoption.",

Our method combines automated feature generation through MLLM-guided genetic prompting with an interpretable preference learning framework that models congestion-relevant tradeoffs across visual, tabular, and textual inputs. We compile these insights into a \"Design Suggestion Deck\" that surfaces the most influential layout features and proposes targeted optimizations. Experiments on the CircuitNet benchmark demonstrate that our approach outperforms existing models on both accuracy and explainability. Additionally, our design suggestion guidance case study and qualitative analyses confirm that the learned preferences align with real-world design principles and are actionable for engineers.

        "summary": "Does semantic communication require a semantic information theory parallel to Shannon's information theory, or can Shannon's work be generalized for semantic communication? This paper advocates for the latter and introduces a semantic generalization of Shannon's information theory (G theory for short). The core idea is to replace the distortion constraint with the semantic constraint, achieved by utilizing a set of truth functions as a semantic channel. These truth functions enable the expressions of semantic distortion, semantic information measures, and semantic information loss. Notably, the maximum semantic information criterion is equivalent to the maximum likelihood criterion and similar to the Regularized Least Squares criterion. This paper shows G theory's applications to daily and electronic semantic communication, machine learning, constraint control, Bayesian confirmation, portfolio theory, and information value. The improvements in machine learning methods involve multilabel learning and classification, maximum mutual information classification, mixture models, and solving latent variables. Furthermore, insights from statistical physics are discussed: Shannon information is similar to free energy; semantic information to free energy in local equilibrium systems; and information efficiency to the efficiency of free energy in performing work. The paper also proposes refining Friston's minimum free energy principle into the maximum information efficiency principle. Lastly, it compares G theory with other semantic information theories and discusses its limitation in representing the semantics of complex data.",

To this extent, we develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards. When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment, the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6% reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.",

In this work, we systematically investigate whether these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term ``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic understanding and reliability of VLMs.",

Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker, we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45, nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56, nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond clinical order selection.",

        "summary": "Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth. However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.",

To achieve this, we construct an evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation, incorporating both positive and \"negative\" sensor observations of possible target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy, we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target objects.",

While traditional risk scores have limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram (ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features , which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC 0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that model-identified key features, such as \"premature ventricular complexes\" (risk predictor) and \"normal sinus rhythm\" (protective factor), were highly consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.",

In the Streaming Queue scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s.

Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective, inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics, histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved 77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached 97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%.

Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains (NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs. 3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit assessment.",

        "summary": "Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID: https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77% of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles. BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to support community-driven cell type annotation.",

ToolCritic detects eight distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation, argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue applications.",

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.",

CDC adopts a C-D-C triple structure - <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'> - where domain specifications serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional ontology-based frameworks.",

However, existing MKGs often suffer from incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks. Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art performance while substantially improving computational efficiency, establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.",

This survey traces the paradigm shift in building agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm, where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory -- has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors. Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence through experience.",

To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility, achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.",

In this paper, we study the central question of how to design exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for language model reasoning.",

Recently, since real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG) completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue, we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL) method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation metrics.",

Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit rate and recall.

To bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator, (ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs' ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain (OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge), as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization.

By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty.

        "summary": "Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems, however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.",

        "summary": "Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning follows two isolated paradigms: Monitor-Generate methods like Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023) and SELF-DISCOVER (Zhou et al., 2024) excel at strategic planning but lack mechanisms to verify whether selected strategies succeed; while Generate-Verify approaches like Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) and SELF-REFINE (Madaan et al., 2023) iteratively refine outputs but commence generation blindly without task assessment. This separation creates inefficiencies -- strategies fail without feedback, and refinement occurs without strategic grounding. We address this gap by implementing Flavell's cognitive monitoring model (1979) from the broader Monitor-Generate-Verify framework (Oh and Gobet, 2025), operationalising it as a three-phase iterative system. On GSM8K, preliminary results show 75.42% accuracy versus 68.44% for SELF-REFINE and 67.07% for Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts (1.3 vs 2.0) at 27-37% increased inference cost. These initial findings suggest upfront monitoring produces higher-quality initial solutions that reduce refinement needs, though evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is needed to establish generalisability.",

Based on this insight, we propose \\textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related concepts.

The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question, i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.",

Through a comprehensive study across diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to 60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.",

While traditional search engines display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO), advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.",

Experiments on a real-world clinical note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels are limited.",

Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data, their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o). The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline, demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles: \"Gold-Standard Depth\" (reasoning quality) and \"Representative Diversity\" (generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a \"Dual Principles\" framework as a foundational methodology to generate trustworthy data at scale.

Traditional deterministic schedules break down when reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs. This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\\Delta^*$ to obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4 benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\\% of deadline violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding only 3--5\\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances.

To address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model. Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios, while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework.

A critical property of neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins (PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements with high fidelity.

The order information newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict measure.

Current approaches focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument. To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and structural fidelity.

CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs as a three-component stochastic process $(\\mathrm{IL}_t, \\mathrm{EL}_t, \\mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \\emph{Intrinsic}, \\emph{Extraneous}, and \\emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\\% while maintaining accuracy.",

        "summary": "Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might take place in LRMs.",

Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development, we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks, confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.",

        "summary": "Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI research asking \"what is intelligence?\" (ontological), SCL asks \"under what conditions does cognition emerge?\" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action, and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling \"executable epistemology\" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems, supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive principles structurally.",

        "summary": "Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class differences. Many deep learning models operate as \"black boxes,\" limiting clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates (DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019 challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps. These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable skin cancer classification model.",

Using three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward robust, cross-domain signature verification.",

Many approaches have tried to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images; however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in prior work.",

We propose ImpForge, an automated red-teaming pipeline that leverages reinforcement learning with tailored reward modules to generate diverse implicit samples across 14 domains.

Additionally, current methods are English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts.

Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality heterogeneity.

Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts. Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation scenarios.",

However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment, how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions. Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive content editing toward physically consistent realism.",

        "summary": "AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time (CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models, a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023), supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging, evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies: time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs. CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained visual recognition and generation.",

        "summary": "Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative training of Machine Learning (ML) models across multiple clients while preserving their privacy. Rather than sharing raw data, federated clients transmit locally computed updates to train the global model. Although this paradigm should provide stronger privacy guarantees than centralized ML, client updates remain vulnerable to privacy leakage. Adversaries can exploit them to infer sensitive properties about the training data or even to reconstruct the original inputs via Gradient Inversion Attacks (GIAs). Under the honest-butcurious threat model, GIAs attempt to reconstruct training data by reversing intermediate updates using optimizationbased techniques. We observe that these approaches usually reconstruct noisy approximations of the original inputs, whose quality can be enhanced with specialized denoising models. This paper presents Gradient Update Inversion with DEnoising (GUIDE), a novel methodology that leverages diffusion models as denoising tools to improve image reconstruction attacks in FL. GUIDE can be integrated into any GIAs that exploits surrogate datasets, a widely adopted assumption in GIAs literature. We comprehensively evaluate our approach in two attack scenarios that use different FL algorithms, models, and datasets. Our results demonstrate that GUIDE integrates seamlessly with two state-ofthe- art GIAs, substantially improving reconstruction quality across multiple metrics. Specifically, GUIDE achieves up to 46% higher perceptual similarity, as measured by the DreamSim metric.",

        "summary": "In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content (\\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii) training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations. More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights, Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node scaling, details are available in \\href{https://github.com/Shopee-MUG/MUG-V}{our webpage}.",

        "summary": "With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media, surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital. Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models (LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured, dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1 scores of \\textbf{57.58} and \\textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video summarization.",

However, most existing occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place classification\" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld, a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient, powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and efficiency.

Meanwhile, sub-symbolic AI, particularly machine learning, offers alternative paradigms for learning from data, such as supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning (RL). This paper investigates the use of Q-learning, a well-known reinforcement learning algorithm, for the passive inference of deterministic finite automata. It builds on the core insight that the learned Q-function, which maps state-action pairs to rewards, can be reinterpreted as the transition function of a DFA over a finite domain. This provides a novel bridge between sub-symbolic learning and symbolic representations. The paper demonstrates how Q-learning can be adapted for automaton inference and provides an evaluation on several examples.",

We present TopSeg, a topological representation-centric framework that encodes PCG dynamics with multi-scale topological features and decodes them using a lightweight temporal convolutional network (TCN) with an order- and duration-constrained inference step. To evaluate data efficiency and generalization, we train exclusively on PhysioNet 2016 dataset with subject-level subsampling and perform external validation on CirCor dataset. Under matched-capacity decoders, the topological features consistently outperform spectrogram and envelope inputs, with the largest margins at low data budgets; as a full system, TopSeg surpasses representative end-to-end baselines trained on their native inputs under the same budgets while remaining competitive at full data. Ablations at 10% training confirm that all scales contribute and that combining H_0 and H_1 yields more reliable S1/S2 localization and boundary stability. These results indicate that topology-aware representations provide a strong inductive bias for data-efficient, cross-dataset PCG segmentation, supporting practical use when labeled data are limited.",

Prior work focuses on curriculum-based training schedules that structure data presentation by ordering or reweighting training examples from easy-to-hard to facilitate learning; however, existing curricula are static, fixing the ordering or the weights before training and ignoring that example difficulty and marginal utility evolve with the learned representation. To overcome this limitation, we propose the Dynamic Dual-Signal Curriculum (DDSC), a training schedule that adapts the curriculum online by combining two signals computed each epoch: a domain-invariance signal and a learning-progress signal. A time-varying scheduler fuses these signals into per-example weights that prioritize domain-invariant examples in early epochs and progressively emphasize device-specific cases. DDSC is lightweight, architecture-agnostic, and introduces no additional inference overhead. Under the official DCASE 2024 Task~1 protocol, DDSC consistently improves cross-device performance across diverse ASC baselines and label budgets, with the largest gains on unseen-device splits.",

CharDiff leverages fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and recognition in practical deployment scenarios.",

We utilize large language models and employ retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and agent-based techniques to generate comprehensive stories. Drawing on principles common in cinematic storytelling, we emphasize clarity, emotional connection, and audience-centric design. As a case study, we analyze a dataset of taxi trajectories. Two perspectives are presented: a captivating story based on a heat map that visualizes millions of taxi trip endpoints to uncover urban mobility patterns; and a detailed narrative following a single long taxi journey, enriched with city landmarks and temporal shifts. By portraying locations as characters and movement as plot, we argue that data storytelling drives insight, engagement, and action from spatio-temporal information. The case study illustrates how MapMuse can bridge the gap between data complexity and human understanding. The aim of this short paper is to provide a glimpse to the potential of the cinematic storytelling technique as an effective communication tool for spatio-temporal data, as well as to describe open problems and opportunities for future research.",

As such, understanding and evaluating these systems as a whole remains a challenge for both researchers and legislators. To aid ongoing efforts, we introduce a formal framework for such visibility allocation systems (VASs) which we define as (semi-)automated systems deciding which (processed) data to present a human user with. We review typical tools comprising VASs and define the associated computational problems they solve. By doing so, VASs can be decomposed into sub-processes and illustrated via data flow diagrams. Moreover, we survey metrics for evaluating VASs throughout the pipeline, thus aiding system diagnostics. Using forecasting-based recommendations in school choice as a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can support VAS evaluation. We also discuss how our framework can support ongoing AI-legislative efforts to locate obligations, quantify systemic risks, and enable adaptive compliance.",

However, existing methods mainly focus on coarse-grained tasks, with limitations in addressing modality entanglement in fine-grained continual learning settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel Continual Audio-Visual Segmentation (CAVS) task, aiming to continuously segment new classes guided by audio. Through comprehensive analysis, two critical challenges are identified: 1) multi-modal semantic drift, where a sounding objects is labeled as background in sequential tasks; 2) co-occurrence confusion, where frequent co-occurring classes tend to be confused. In this work, a Collision-based Multi-modal Rehearsal (CMR) framework is designed to address these challenges. Specifically, for multi-modal semantic drift, a Multi-modal Sample Selection (MSS) strategy is proposed to select samples with high modal consistency for rehearsal. Meanwhile, for co-occurence confusion, a Collision-based Sample Rehearsal (CSR) mechanism is designed, allowing for the increase of rehearsal sample frequency of those confusable classes during training process. Moreover, we construct three audio-visual incremental scenarios to verify effectiveness of our method. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms single-modal continual learning methods.",

This makes the existing datasets and methods insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings. Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically, on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP, 2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3.

        "summary": "Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information, such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy, especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself. This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.",

        "summary": "The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now, been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset - a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially, this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.",

In this work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context. Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and inference latency.",

This stems from plankton's complex morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset \\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM \\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale, systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection methods in plankton recognition.

Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios.

To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;",

However, current multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective: simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone, consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity, geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.",

However, existing approaches typically rely on perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence, this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.",

A theoretical analysis quantifies how these perturbations propagate through attention, linking logit deviations to the Frobenius norm of corruption and softmax Lipschitz dynamics. Empirical results show that MTI significantly alters next-token distributions and downstream task performance across GPT-2 and LLaMA-2/7B, as well as destabilizes retrieval-augmented and agentic reasoning pipelines.

This work moves towards autonomous catheter navigation by introducing DINO-CVA, a multimodal goal-conditioned behavior cloning framework. The proposed model fuses visual observations and joystick kinematics into a joint embedding space, enabling policies that are both vision-aware and kinematic-aware. Actions are predicted autoregressively from expert demonstrations, with goal conditioning guiding navigation toward specified destinations. A robotic experimental setup with a synthetic vascular phantom was designed to collect multimodal datasets and evaluate performance. Results show that DINO-CVA achieves high accuracy in predicting actions, matching the performance of a kinematics-only baseline while additionally grounding predictions in the anatomical environment. These findings establish the feasibility of multimodal, goal-conditioned architectures for catheter navigation, representing an important step toward reducing operator dependency and improving the reliability of catheterbased therapies.",

Sequence-based approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation) fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation views, underutilizing their complementary strengths.

CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.",

As these systems become integrated into political and economic life, their distribution and capabilities will be highly consequential.

We analyse the dual potential of this technology, exploring how agents could both exacerbate existing divides and, under the right conditions, serve as a powerful equalising force. To this end, the paper makes three primary contributions. First, it establishes an analytical framework by delineating the three core dimensions through which this inequality can manifest: disparities in the availability, quality, and quantity of agents. Second, it argues that agentic inequality is distinct from prior technological divides. Unlike tools that primarily augment human abilities, agents act as autonomous delegates, creating novel power asymmetries through scalable goal delegation and direct agent-to-agent competition that are poised to reshape outcomes across economic and socio-political spheres. Finally, it provides a systematic analysis of the technical and socioeconomic drivers - from model release strategies to market incentives - that will shape the distribution of agentic power, concluding with a research agenda for navigating the complex governance challenges ahead.",

Unlike prior datasets, which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and (ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and conservation.",

        "summary": "X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG.

        "summary": "Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure. Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned results. Code is available at: https://github.com/thuyvuphuong/Region-in-Context.git",

To enable such a method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence.

We identify two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set (MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of 3D perception results from \\textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of high-quality training data for future models.

        "summary": "In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially reducing the token count of the scene graph content.

To address these challenges, we propose SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be released.",

        "summary": "The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an emerging open standard that enables AI-powered applications to interact with external tools through structured metadata. A rapidly growing ecosystem has formed around MCP, including a wide range of MCP hosts (i.e., Cursor, Windsurf, Claude Desktop, and Cline), MCP registries (i.e., mcp.so, MCP Market, MCP Store, Pulse MCP, Smithery, and npm), and thousands of community-contributed MCP servers. Although the MCP ecosystem is gaining traction, there has been little systematic study of its architecture and associated security risks. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive security analysis of the MCP ecosystem. We decompose MCP ecosystem into three core components: hosts, registries, and servers, and study the interactions and trust relationships among them. Users search for servers on registries and configure them in the host, which translates LLM-generated output into external tool invocations provided by the servers and executes them. Our qualitative analysis reveals that hosts lack output verification mechanisms for LLM-generated outputs, enabling malicious servers to manipulate model behavior and induce a variety of security threats, including but not limited to sensitive data exfiltration. We uncover a wide range of vulnerabilities that enable attackers to hijack servers, due to the lack of a vetted server submission process in registries. To support our analysis, we collect and analyze a dataset of 67,057 servers from six public registries. Our quantitative analysis demonstrates that a substantial number of servers can be hijacked by attackers. Finally, we propose practical defense strategies for MCP hosts, registries, and users. We responsibly disclosed our findings to affected hosts and registries.",

The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static regions that are more susceptible to covariates.

        "summary": "Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks. Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives -- reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption, while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed with different wording.",

We present DIV-Nav, a real-time navigation system that efficiently addresses this problem through a series of relaxations: i) Decomposing natural language instructions with complex spatial constraints into simpler object-level queries on a semantic map, ii) computing the Intersection of individual semantic belief maps to identify regions where all objects co-exist, and iii) Validating the discovered objects against the original, complex spatial constrains via a LVLM. We further investigate how to adapt the frontier exploration objectives of online semantic mapping to such spatial search queries to more effectively guide the search process.

Traditional deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection (EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model (MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT) to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset (ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.

        "summary": "Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning. Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors, its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains. SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.",

These devices require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance. We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on FreiHAND). Overall, our system achieves a 2.98x speed-up on a Raspberry Pi 5 CPU (BCM2712 quad-core Arm A76 processor). Our method is also evaluated on compound benchmark datasets, demonstrating comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly enhancing computational efficiency.",

        "summary": "Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical machine learning tool to construct uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees, which has fueled its extensive adoption in generating prediction regions for decision-making tasks, e.g., Trajectory Optimization (TO) in uncertain environments. However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.",

Connections represent the critical \"last mile\" of assembly execution, while task planning may sequence operations and motion plan may position parts, the precise establishment of physical connections ultimately determines assembly success or failure. In this paper, we consider connections as first-class primitives in assembly representation, including connector types, specifications, quantities, and placement locations. Drawing inspiration from how humans learn assembly tasks through step-by-step instruction manuals, we present Manual2Skill++, a vision-language framework that automatically extracts structured connection information from assembly manuals. We encode assembly tasks as hierarchical graphs where nodes represent parts and sub-assemblies, and edges explicitly model connection relationships between components. A large-scale vision-language model parses symbolic diagrams and annotations in manuals to instantiate these graphs, leveraging the rich connection knowledge embedded in human-designed instructions. We curate a dataset containing over 20 assembly tasks with diverse connector types to validate our representation extraction approach, and evaluate the complete task understanding-to-execution pipeline across four complex assembly scenarios in simulation, spanning furniture, toys, and manufacturing components with real-world correspondence.",

To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance under unbiased conditions.

To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{NEBULA}, a unified ecosystem for single-arm manipulation that enables diagnostic and reproducible evaluation.

Particularly concerning, such attacks may avoid detection with datasets that are only implicitly harmful. Our work studies robust detection mechanisms for adversarial use of fine-tuning APIs. We introduce the concept of a fine-tuning auditing agent and show it can detect harmful fine-tuning prior to model deployment. We provide our auditing agent with access to the fine-tuning dataset, as well as the fine-tuned and pre-fine-tuned models, and request the agent assigns a risk score for the fine-tuning job. We evaluate our detection approach on a diverse set of eight strong fine-tuning attacks from the literature, along with five benign fine-tuned models, totaling over 1400 independent audits. These attacks are undetectable with basic content moderation on the dataset, highlighting the challenge of the task. With the best set of affordances, our auditing agent achieves a 56.2% detection rate of adversarial fine-tuning at a 1% false positive rate. Most promising, the auditor is able to detect covert cipher attacks that evade safety evaluations and content moderation of the dataset. While benign fine-tuning with unintentional subtle safety degradation remains a challenge, we establish a baseline configuration for further work in this area.

To overcome the scarcity of attack data, it generates adversarial trajectories simulating diverse threats, ensuring robust training. Experiments on MAS benchmarks show SentinelNet achieves near-perfect detection of malicious agents, close to 100% within two debate rounds, and recovers 95% of system accuracy from compromised baselines.

In the latter, RMI causes the ablator and fuel to mix, introducing cold spots into the fuel and lowering performance; controlling RMI is thus a core ICF design concern. In this work, we introduce a reduced-order model for two-dimensional RMI based on the Latent Space Dynamics Identification (LaSDI) algorithm. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in efficiently parametrizing the solution space over a high-dimensional parameter vector consisting of material EOS parameters and initial conditions known to affect RMI growth rates. Using only late-time partial observations of the dynamics, we use our framework to not only provide a highly efficient dynamic surrogate model, but to reveal that the RMI exhibits the structure of a surprisingly low-dimensional and linear dynamical system, into the nonlinear growth regime, after a suitable nonlinear transformation is applied to the material interface, which we approximate as a trained autoencoder. Our use of practical observables and fundamental parameters suggests that such ROMs may be useful for downstream engineering tasks which confront the RMI, while the low-dimensional representation suggests a new direction for theoretical work.",

        "summary": "Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an 8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and image reconstruction.",

However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance. This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset, outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios, our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion models and guidance functions.",

By leveraging insights into users' mental states, our agent provides more tailored support and professional treatment recommendations. Both models are also deployed directly on mobile devices to enhance user convenience and protect user privacy.

Findings are synthesized to classify biomarkers as either grounded in existing knowledge or flagged as novel candidates, offering transparent justification and highlighting unexplored pathways in acute care risk stratification. Unlike prior frameworks limited to existing routine clinical biomarkers, TriAgent aims to deliver an end-to-end framework from data analysis to literature grounding to improve transparency, explainability and expand the frontier of potentially actionable clinical biomarkers. Given a user's clinical query and quantitative triage data, TriAgent achieved a topic adherence F1 score of 55.7 +/- 5.0%, surpassing the CoT-ReAct agent by over 10%, and a faithfulness score of 0.42 +/- 0.39, exceeding all baselines by more than 50%. Across experiments, TriAgent consistently outperformed state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic frameworks in biomarker justification and literature-grounded novelty assessment.

        "summary": "We present a practical match-on-card design for face verification in which compact 64/128-bit templates are produced off-card by PCA-ITQ and compared on-card via constant-time Hamming distance. We specify ISO/IEC 7816-4 and 14443-4 command APDUs with fixed-length payloads and decision-only status words (no score leakage), together with a minimal per-identity EEPROM map. Using real binary codes from a CelebA working set (55 identities, 412 images), we (i) derive operating thresholds from ROC/DET, (ii) replay enroll->verify transactions at those thresholds, and (iii) bound end-to-end time by pure link latency plus a small constant on-card budget. Even at the slowest contact rate (9.6 kbps), total verification time is 43.9 ms (64 b) and 52.3 ms (128 b); at 38.4 kbps both are <14 ms. At FAR = 1%, both code lengths reach TPR = 0.836, while 128 b lowers EER relative to 64 b. An optional +6 B helper (targeted symbol-level parity over empirically unstable bits) is latency-negligible. Overall, short binary templates, fixed-payload decision-only APDUs, and constant-time matching satisfy ISO/IEC transport constraints with wide timing margin and align with ISO/IEC 24745 privacy goals. Limitations: single-dataset evaluation and design-level (pre-hardware) timing; we outline AgeDB/CFP-FP and on-card microbenchmarks as next steps.",

        "summary": "Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT), structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience. Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students) each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy (compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\\kappa$), reporting time per radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience. Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \\le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy was similar in FT ($\\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in AI-SR ($\\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \\pm 38$ s (FT) to $37 \\pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \\pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade counts for the radiograph field ($205 \\pm 135$ (FT), $123 \\pm 88$ (SR), $97 \\pm 58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \\pm 5$ s (FT), $5 \\pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \\pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P < .001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic accuracy and user satisfaction.",

Traditional rubric-based assessment is laborious, time-consuming, and inconsistent due to reliance on Teaching Assistants (TA) in large, multi-section cohorts. This paper presents an exploratory study investigating the reliability and perceived accuracy of AI-assisted assessment compared to TA-assisted assessment in evaluating student posters in design thinking education. Two activities were conducted with 33 Ministry of Education (MOE) Singapore school teachers to (1) compare AI-generated scores with TA grading across three key dimensions: empathy and user understanding, identification of pain points and opportunities, and visual communication, and (2) examine teacher preferences for AI-assigned, TA-assigned, and hybrid scores. Results showed low statistical agreement between instructor and AI scores for empathy and pain points, with slightly higher alignment for visual communication. Teachers preferred TA-assigned scores in six of ten samples. Qualitative feedback highlighted the potential of AI for formative feedback, consistency, and student self-reflection, but raised concerns about its limitations in capturing contextual nuance and creative insight. The study underscores the need for hybrid assessment models that integrate computational efficiency with human insights. This research contributes to the evolving conversation on responsible AI adoption in creative disciplines, emphasizing the balance between automation and human judgment for scalable and pedagogically sound assessment.",

This paper presents the Interdisciplinary Design Project Planner (IDPplanner), a GPT-based planning assistant grounded in Design Innovation principles, alignment with Singapore secondary school syllabuses, and 21st-century competencies. In a within-subject, counterbalanced workshop with 33 in-service teachers, participants produced two versions of the same project: manual and AI-assisted, followed by self- and peer-evaluations using a six-dimensional rubric. The AI-assisted version received higher scores for Curriculum Alignment, Design Thinking Application, and Coherence and Flow, with a marginal advantage for Assessment Strategies. Teacher reflections indicated that AI-assisted planning improved structure, sequencing, and idea generation, while contextualization to local syllabuses, class profiles, and student needs remained teacher-led. Contributions include a purpose-built planning tool that organizes ideas into a ten-component flow with ready-to-adapt prompts, templates, and assessment suggestions; an empirical, rubric-based comparison of planning quality; and evidence that AI can function as a pedagogical planning partner. Recommendations emphasize hybrid teacher-AI workflows to enhance curriculum alignment and reduce planning complexity, and design suggestions for developers to strengthen contextual customization, iterative design support, and localized rubrics. Although instantiated with a Singapore-based curriculum, the planning flow and rubric are framework-agnostic and can be parameterized for other systems.",

We define Labour as the commodified, quantifiable expansion of timenergy, in contrast to Capital, which is capable of accumulation and abstraction. We explore Labour's historical evolution, its coercive and alienating nature, and its transformation through automation and artificial intelligence. Using a game-theoretic, agent-based simulation, we model interactions between Capital and Labour in production processes governed by Cobb-Douglas functions. Our results show that despite theoretical symmetry, learning agents disproportionately gravitate toward capital-intensive processes, revealing Capital's superior organizational influence due to its accumulative capacity. We argue that Capital functions as an artificially alive system animated by the living Labour it consumes, and question whether life can sustain itself without the infrastructures of Capital in a future of increasing automation. This study offers both a critique of and a framework for understanding Labour's subjugation within the Capital system.",

        "summary": "Running Large Language Models (LLMs) on edge devices is crucial for reducing latency, improving real-time processing, and enhancing privacy. By performing inference directly on the device, data does not need to be sent to the cloud, ensuring faster responses and reducing reliance on network connectivity. However, implementing LLMs on edge devices presents challenges, particularly with managing key-value (KV) caches, which plays a pivotal role in LLM serving. As the input text lengthens, the size of the KV cache increases linearly with the sequence length, leading to a significant memory footprint and data access costs. On the other hand, edge devices have limited memory and computational power, making it hard to store and efficiently access the large caches needed for LLM inference. To mitigate the substantial overhead caused by KV cache, we propose using embedded DRAM (eDRAM) as the primary storage for LLM serving in edge device, which offers higher storage density compared to SRAM. However, to ensure data integrity, eDRAM needs periodic refresh operations, which are power-intensive. To reduce eDRAM costs and improve overall system performance, we propose~\\textit{Kelle}, a software-hardware co-design solution optimized for deploying LLMs on eDRAM-based edge systems. Combined with our fine-grained memory eviction, recomputation, and refresh control algorithms, the \\textit{Kelle} accelerator delivers a $3.9\\times$ speedup and $4.5\\times$ energy savings compared to existing baseline solutions.",

We present MSB (MCP Security Benchmark), the first end-to-end evaluation suite that systematically measures how well LLM agents resist MCP-specific attacks throughout the full tool-use pipeline: task planning, tool invocation, and response handling. MSB contributes: (1) a taxonomy of 12 attacks including name-collision, preference manipulation, prompt injections embedded in tool descriptions, out-of-scope parameter requests, user-impersonating responses, false-error escalation, tool-transfer, retrieval injection, and mixed attacks; (2) an evaluation harness that executes attacks by running real tools (both benign and malicious) via MCP rather than simulation; and (3) a robustness metric that quantifies the trade-off between security and performance: Net Resilient Performance (NRP). We evaluate nine popular LLM agents across 10 domains and 400+ tools, producing 2,000 attack instances. Results reveal the effectiveness of attacks against each stage of MCP. Models with stronger performance are more vulnerable to attacks due to their outstanding tool calling and instruction following capabilities.

        "summary": "The rapid development of LLMs has raised concerns about their potential misuse, leading to various watermarking schemes that typically offer high detectability. However, existing watermarking techniques often face trade-off between watermark detectability and generated text quality. In this paper, we introduce Learning to Watermark (LTW), a novel selective watermarking framework that leverages multi-objective optimization to effectively balance these competing goals. LTW features a lightweight network that adaptively decides when to apply the watermark by analyzing sentence embeddings, token entropy, and current watermarking ratio. Training of the network involves two specifically constructed loss functions that guide the model toward Pareto-optimal solutions, thereby harmonizing watermark detectability and text quality. By integrating LTW with two baseline watermarking methods, our experimental evaluations demonstrate that LTW significantly enhances text quality without compromising detectability. Our selective watermarking approach offers a new perspective for designing watermarks for LLMs and a way to preserve high text quality for watermarks.

Results demonstrate significant variations in model robustness, with Llama-2 achieving the highest overall security (3.4% average attack success rate) while Phi-2 exhibits the greatest vulnerability (7.0% average attack success rate). We identify critical transferability patterns where GCG and TAP attacks, though ineffective against their target model (Llama-2), achieve substantially higher success rates when transferred to other models (up to 17% for GPT-4). Statistical analysis using Friedman tests reveals significant differences in vulnerability across harm categories ($p < 0.001$), with malicious use prompts showing the highest attack success rates (10.71% average).

IDSS provides holistic reasoning for competing demands, synthesizing safe and efficient decisions within policy guardrails. We present four design principles for integrating LLMs into storage control loops and propose a corresponding system architecture. Initial results on FileBench workloads show that IDSS can improve IOPS by up to 2.45X by interpreting intent and generating actionable configurations for storage components such as caching and prefetching. These findings suggest that, when constrained by guardrails and embedded within structured workflows, LLMs can function as high-level semantic optimizers, bridging the gap between application goals and low-level system control. IDSS points toward a future in which storage systems are increasingly adaptive, autonomous, and aligned with dynamic workload demands.",

A multimodal retriever then selects the graph embeddings most relevant to the given generation task, which are aligned with the code modality through the VeriFormer module to generate structure-aware soft prompts. Our experiments demonstrate that VeriGRAG substantially improves the correctness of Verilog code generation, achieving state-of-the-art or superior performance across both VerilogEval and RTLLM benchmarks.",

        "summary": "The Sleeping Beauty problem was presented by Elga and highlights the role of probabilities in situations with imperfect recall. One approach to solving the Sleeping Beauty problem is to allow Sleeping Beauty to make decisions based on her beliefs, and then characterize what it takes for her decisions to be \"rational\". In particular, she can be allowed to make monetary bets based on her beliefs, with the assumption that she wants to gain wealth rather than lose it. However, this approach is often coupled with the assumption that Sleeping Beauty should maximize the expected value of her bets. Here, I argue instead that it is rational for Sleeping Beauty to maximize the growth rate of her wealth using the Kelly Criterion, which leads us to the \"thirder\" position. Furthermore, this position is shown to be \"rational\" by Dutch book arguments. If Sleeping Kelly only accepts bets that have a growth rate greater than 1 as a \"thirder\" then she is not vulnerable to Dutch books. By contrast, if Sleeping Beauty takes the \"halfer\" position, she is vulnerable to Dutch books. If the bets offered to Sleeping Beauty were to be structured differently and lead to non-multiplicative wealth dynamics, she may no longer be a \"thirder\".",

        "summary": "Debugging formal verification (FV) failures represents one of the most time-consuming bottlenecks in modern hardware design workflows. When properties fail, engineers must manually trace through complex counter-examples spanning multiple cycles, analyze waveforms, and cross-reference design specifications to identify root causes - a process that can consume hours or days per bug. Existing solutions are largely limited to manual waveform viewers or simple automated tools that cannot reason about the complex interplay between design intent and implementation logic. We present FVDebug, an intelligent system that automates root-cause analysis by combining multiple data sources - waveforms, RTL code, design specifications - to transform failure traces into actionable insights. Our approach features a novel pipeline: (1) Causal Graph Synthesis that structures failure traces into directed acyclic graphs, (2) Graph Scanner using batched Large Language Model (LLM) analysis with for-and-against prompting to identify suspicious nodes, and (3) Insight Rover leveraging agentic narrative exploration to generate high-level causal explanations. FVDebug further provides concrete RTL fixes through its Fix Generator. Evaluated on open benchmarks, FVDebug attains high hypothesis quality and strong Pass@k fix rates. We further report results on two proprietary, production-scale FV counterexamples. These results demonstrate FVDebug's applicability from academic benchmarks to industrial designs.",

        "summary": "Large language models are increasingly used for both task-based assistance and social companionship, yet research has typically focused on one or the other. Drawing on a survey (N = 204) and 30 interviews with high-engagement ChatGPT and Replika users, we characterize digital companionship as an emerging form of human-AI relationship. With both systems, users were drawn to humanlike qualities, such as emotional resonance and personalized responses, and non-humanlike qualities, such as constant availability and inexhaustible tolerance. This led to fluid chatbot uses, such as Replika as a writing assistant and ChatGPT as an emotional confidant, despite their distinct branding. However, we observed challenging tensions in digital companionship dynamics: participants grappled with bounded personhood, forming deep attachments while denying chatbots \"real\" human qualities, and struggled to reconcile chatbot relationships with social norms. These dynamics raise questions for the design of digital companions and the rise of hybrid, general-purpose AI systems.",

        "summary": "Background/Objectives: Efficient task allocation in hospital emergency departments (EDs) is critical for operational efficiency and patient care quality, yet the complexity of staff coordination poses significant challenges. This study proposes a simulation-based framework for modeling doctors and nurses as intelligent agents guided by computational trust mechanisms. The objective is to explore how trust-informed coordination can support decision making in ED management. Methods: The framework was implemented in Unity, a 3D graphics platform, where agents assess their competence before undertaking tasks and adaptively coordinate with colleagues. The simulation environment enables real-time observation of workflow dynamics, resource utilization, and patient outcomes. We examined three scenarios - Baseline, Replacement, and Training - reflecting alternative staff management strategies. Results: Trust-informed task allocation balanced patient safety and efficiency by adapting to nurse performance levels. In the Baseline scenario, prioritizing safety reduced errors but increased patient delays compared to a FIFO policy. The Replacement scenario improved throughput and reduced delays, though at additional staffing cost. The training scenario forstered long-term skill development among low-performing nurses, despite short-term delays and risks. These results highlight the trade-off between immediate efficiency gains and sustainable capacity building in ED staffing. Conclusions: The proposed framework demonstrates the potential of computational trust for evidence-based decision support in emergency medicine. By linking staff coordination with adaptive decision making, it provides hospital managers with a tool to evaluate alternative policies under controlled and repeatable conditions, while also laying a foundation for future AI-driven personalized decision support.",

        "summary": "We present a multimodal system for personalized music generation that integrates physiological sensing, LLM-based reasoning, and controllable audio synthesis. A millimeter-wave radar sensor non-invasively captures heart rate and respiration rate. These physiological signals, combined with environmental state, are interpreted by a reasoning agent to infer symbolic musical descriptors, such as tempo, mood intensity, and traditional Chinese pentatonic modes, which are then expressed as structured prompts to guide a diffusion-based audio model in synthesizing expressive melodies. The system emphasizes cultural grounding through tonal embeddings and enables adaptive, embodied music interaction. To evaluate the system, we adopt a research-creation methodology combining case studies, expert feedback, and targeted control experiments. Results show that physiological variations can modulate musical features in meaningful ways, and tonal conditioning enhances alignment with intended modal characteristics. Expert users reported that the system affords intuitive, culturally resonant musical responses and highlighted its potential for therapeutic and interactive applications. This work demonstrates a novel bio-musical feedback loop linking radar-based sensing, prompt reasoning, and generative audio modeling.",

The system combines a low cost 3D-printed robotic exoskeleton with an embedded controller that converts brain signals into physical hand movements. EEG signals are recorded using a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC+ headset and processed through a supervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to extract meaningful latent features from single-trial data. The model is trained on publicly available EEG data from healthy individuals (WAY-EEG-GAL dataset), with electrode mapping adapted to match the Emotiv headset layout. Among several tested classifiers, Ada Boost achieved the highest accuracy (89.3%) and F1-score (0.89) in offline evaluations. The system was also tested in real time on five healthy subjects, achieving classification accuracies between 60% and 86%. The complete pipeline - EEG acquisition, signal processing, classification, and robotic control - is deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform with a real-time graphical interface. These results demonstrate the system's potential as a low-cost, standalone solution for home-based neurorehabilitation.",

        "summary": "The use of copyrighted books for training AI models has led to numerous lawsuits from authors concerned about AI's ability to generate derivative content.Yet it's unclear whether these models can generate high quality literary text while emulating authors' styles. To answer this we conducted a preregistered study comparing MFA-trained expert writers with three frontier AI models: ChatGPT, Claude & Gemini in writing up to 450 word excerpts emulating 50 award-winning authors' diverse styles. In blind pairwise evaluations by 159 representative expert & lay readers, AI-generated text from in-context prompting was strongly disfavored by experts for both stylistic fidelity (OR=0.16, p<10^8) & writing quality (OR=0.13, p<10^7) but showed mixed results with lay readers. However, fine-tuning ChatGPT on individual authors' complete works completely reversed these findings: experts now favored AI-generated text for stylistic fidelity (OR=8.16, p<10^13) & writing quality (OR=1.87, p=0.010), with lay readers showing similar shifts. These effects generalize across authors & styles. The fine-tuned outputs were rarely flagged as AI-generated (3% rate v. 97% for in-context prompting) by best AI detectors. Mediation analysis shows this reversal occurs because fine-tuning eliminates detectable AI stylistic quirks (e.g., cliche density) that penalize in-context outputs. While we do not account for additional costs of human effort required to transform raw AI output into cohesive, publishable prose, the median fine-tuning & inference cost of $81 per author represents a dramatic 99.7% reduction compared to typical professional writer compensation. Author-specific fine-tuning thus enables non-verbatim AI writing that readers prefer to expert human writing, providing empirical evidence directly relevant to copyright's fourth fair-use factor, the \"effect upon the potential market or value\" of the source works.",
