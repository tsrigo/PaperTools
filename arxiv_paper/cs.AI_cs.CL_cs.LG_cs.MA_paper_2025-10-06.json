        "summary": "The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into multiagent systems has opened new possibilities for collaborative reasoning and cooperation with AI agents. This paper explores different prompting methods and evaluates their effectiveness in enhancing agent collaborative behaviour and decision-making. We enhance CoELA, a framework designed for building Collaborative Embodied Agents that leverage LLMs for multi-agent communication, reasoning, and task coordination in shared virtual spaces. Through systematic experimentation, we examine different LLMs and prompt engineering strategies to identify optimised combinations that maximise collaboration performance. Furthermore, we extend our research by integrating speech capabilities, enabling seamless collaborative voice-based interactions. Our findings highlight the effectiveness of prompt optimisation in enhancing collaborative agent performance; for example, our best combination improved the efficiency of the system running with Gemma3 by 22% compared to the original CoELA system. In addition, the speech integration provides a more engaging user interface for iterative system development and demonstrations.",

        "summary": "We investigate a public announcement logic for asynchronous public announcements wherein the sending of the announcements by the environment is separated from the reception of the announcements by the individual agents. Both come with different modalities. In the logical semantics, formulas are interpreted in a world of a Kripke model but given a history of prior announcements and receptions of announcements that already happened. An axiomatisation AA for such a logic has been given in prior work, for the formulas that are valid when interpreted in the Kripke model before any such announcements have taken place. This axiomatisation is a reduction system wherein one can show that every formula is equivalent to a purely epistemic formula without dynamic modalities for announcements and receptions. We propose a generalisation AA* of this axiomatisation, for the formulas that are valid when interpreted in the Kripke model given any history of prior announcements and receptions of announcements. It does not extend the axiomatisation AA, for example it is no longer valid that nobody has received any announcement. Unlike AA, this axiomatisation AA* is infinitary and it is not a reduction system.",

To address those limitations, we propose AMANDA, a training-free agentic framework that performs medical knowledge augmentation via LLM agents. Specifically, our intrinsic medical knowledge augmentation focuses on coarse-to-fine question decomposition for comprehensive diagnosis, while extrinsic medical knowledge augmentation grounds the reasoning process via biomedical knowledge graph retrieval. Extensive experiments across eight Med-VQA benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements in both zero-shot and few-shot Med-VQA settings.

We find that the two research areas are mostly separate, leading to redundant terminology and repeated pitfalls. Common challenges include susceptibility to spurious correlations, impact on downstream reward hacking, methods to improve data quality, and approaches to meta-evaluation. Our position paper argues that a closer collaboration between the fields can help overcome these issues. To that end, we show how metrics outperform reward models on specific tasks and provide an extensive survey of the two areas. Grounded in this survey, we point to multiple research topics in which closer alignment can improve reward models and metrics in areas such as preference elicitation methods, avoidance of spurious correlations and reward hacking, and calibration-aware meta-evaluation.",

However, as reasoning chains extend, critical intermediate steps and the original prompt will be buried in the context, receiving insufficient attention and leading to errors. In this paper, we propose Self-Anchor, a novel pipeline that leverages the inherent structure of reasoning to steer LLM attention. Self-Anchor decomposes reasoning trajectories into structured plans and automatically aligns the model's attention to the most relevant inference steps, allowing the model to maintain focus throughout generation. Our experiment shows that Self-Anchor outperforms SOTA prompting methods across six benchmarks. Notably, Self-Anchor significantly reduces the performance gap between ``non-reasoning'' models and specialized reasoning models, with the potential to enable most LLMs to tackle complex reasoning tasks without retraining.",

        "summary": "Multi-LLM systems harness the complementary strengths of diverse Large Language Models, achieving performance and efficiency gains unattainable by a single model. In existing designs, LLMs communicate through text, forcing internal representations to be transformed into output token sequences. This process both loses rich semantic information and incurs token-by-token generation latency. Motivated by these limitations, we ask: Can LLMs communicate beyond text? Oracle experiments show that enriching the KV-Cache semantics can improve response quality without increasing cache size, supporting KV-Cache as an effective medium for inter-model communication. Thus, we propose Cache-to-Cache (C2C), a new paradigm for direct semantic communication between LLMs. C2C uses a neural network to project and fuse the source model's KV-cache with that of the target model to enable direct semantic transfer. A learnable gating mechanism selects the target layers that benefit from cache communication. Compared with text communication, C2C utilizes the deep, specialized semantics from both models, while avoiding explicit intermediate text generation. Experiments show that C2C achieves 8.5-10.5% higher average accuracy than individual models. It further outperforms the text communication paradigm by approximately 3.0-5.0%, while delivering an average 2.0x speedup in latency. Our code is available at https://github.com/thu-nics/C2C.",

This saturates context limits and increases computational cost processing; moreover, processing full pages exposes agents to security risks such as prompt injection. Existing pruning strategies either discard relevant content or retain irrelevant context, leading to suboptimal action prediction. We introduce FocusAgent, a simple yet effective approach that leverages a lightweight LLM retriever to extract the most relevant lines from accessibility tree (AxTree) observations, guided by task goals. By pruning noisy and irrelevant content, FocusAgent enables efficient reasoning while reducing vulnerability to injection attacks. Experiments on WorkArena and WebArena benchmarks show that FocusAgent matches the performance of strong baselines, while reducing observation size by over 50%. Furthermore, a variant of FocusAgent significantly reduces the success rate of prompt-injection attacks, including banner and pop-up attacks, while maintaining task success performance in attack-free settings. Our results highlight that targeted LLM-based retrieval is a practical and robust strategy for building web agents that are efficient, effective, and secure.",

Ablations on the amount of unlabeled target data show that, for subsets consisting of as few as 25 examples, NN-Rank produces high-quality rankings which achieve 92.8% of the NDCG achieved using all available target data for ranking.",

Using these similarity metrics as intermediate supervision, we then train EditLens, a regression model that predicts the amount of AI editing present within a text. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on both binary (F1=94.7%) and ternary (F1=90.4%) classification tasks in distinguishing human, AI, and mixed writing.

To diagnose this, we investigate the model's internal representations and find that the final layer, biased by English-centric training, provides a poor signal for multilingual confidence. In contrast, our layer-wise analysis uncovers a key insight that late-intermediate layers consistently offer a more reliable and better-calibrated signal. Building on this, we introduce a suite of training-free methods, including Language-Aware Confidence Ensemble (LACE), which adaptively selects an optimal ensemble of layers for each specific language.

        "summary": "Radiology report evaluation is a crucial part of radiologists' training and plays a key role in ensuring diagnostic accuracy. As part of the standard reporting workflow, a junior radiologist typically prepares a preliminary report, which is then reviewed and edited by a senior radiologist to produce the final report. Identifying semantic differences between preliminary and final reports is essential for junior doctors, both as a training tool and to help uncover gaps in clinical knowledge. While AI in radiology is a rapidly growing field, the application of large language models (LLMs) remains challenging due to the need for specialised domain knowledge. In this paper, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide explainable and accurate comparisons of reports in the radiology domain. We begin by comparing the performance of several LLMs in comparing radiology reports. We then assess a more traditional approach based on Named-Entity-Recognition (NER). However, both approaches exhibit limitations in delivering accurate feedback on semantic similarity. To address this, we propose Llama-EntScore, a semantic similarity scoring method using a combination of Llama 3.1 and NER with tunable weights to emphasise or de-emphasise specific types of differences. Our approach generates a quantitative similarity score for tracking progress and also gives an interpretation of the score that aims to offer valuable guidance in reviewing and refining their reporting. We find our method achieves 67% exact-match accuracy and 93% accuracy within +/- 1 when compared to radiologist-provided ground truth scores - outperforming both LLMs and NER used independently.

        "summary": "Recent work on Speech-to-Text Translation (S2TT) has focused on LLM-based models, introducing the increasingly adopted Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, where the model is guided to first transcribe the speech and then translate it. CoT typically outperforms direct prompting primarily because it can exploit abundant Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and Text-to-Text Translation (T2TT) datasets to explicitly model its steps. In this paper, we systematically compare CoT and Direct prompting under increasing amounts of S2TT data. To this end, we pseudo-label an ASR corpus by translating its transcriptions into six European languages, and train LLM-based S2TT systems with both prompting strategies at different data scales. Our results show that Direct improves more consistently as the amount of data increases, suggesting that it may become a more effective approach as larger S2TT resources are created.",

        "summary": "This paper presents the development and evaluation of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying the United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) clinical guidelines using Large Language Models (LLMs). The extensive length and volume of these guidelines can impede their utilisation within a time-constrained healthcare system, a challenge this project addresses through the creation of a system capable of providing users with precisely matched information in response to natural language queries. The system's retrieval architecture, composed of a hybrid embedding mechanism, was evaluated against a database of 10,195 text chunks derived from three hundred guidelines. It demonstrates high performance, with a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) of 0.814, a Recall of 81% at the first chunk and of 99.1% within the top ten retrieved chunks, when evaluated on 7901 queries. The most significant impact of the RAG system was observed during the generation phase. When evaluated on a manually curated dataset of seventy question-answer pairs, RAG-enhanced models showed substantial gains in performance. Faithfulness, the measure of whether an answer is supported by the source text, was increased by 64.7 percentage points to 99.5% for the RAG-enhanced O4-Mini model and significantly outperformed the medical-focused Meditron3-8B LLM, which scored 43%. This, combined with a perfect Context Precision score of 1 for all RAG-enhanced models, confirms the system's ability to prevent information fabrication by grounding its answers in relevant source material. This study thus establishes RAG as an effective, reliable, and scalable approach for applying generative AI in healthcare, enabling cost-effective access to medical guidelines.",

Existing membership inference attacks (MIAs) and dataset-inference methods typically require access to internal signals such as logits, while current black-box approaches often rely on handcrafted prompts or a clean reference dataset for calibration, both of which limit practical applicability. Watermarking is a promising alternative, but prior techniques can degrade text quality or reduce task performance. We propose TRACE, a practical framework for fully black-box detection of copyrighted dataset usage in LLM fine-tuning. \\texttt{TRACE} rewrites datasets with distortion-free watermarks guided by a private key, ensuring both text quality and downstream utility. At detection time, we exploit the radioactivity effect of fine-tuning on watermarked data and introduce an entropy-gated procedure that selectively scores high-uncertainty tokens, substantially amplifying detection power. Across diverse datasets and model families, TRACE consistently achieves significant detections (p<0.05), often with extremely strong statistical evidence. Furthermore, it supports multi-dataset attribution and remains robust even after continued pretraining on large non-watermarked corpora.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) increasingly solve complex reasoning tasks via long chain-of-thought, but their forward-only autoregressive generation process is fragile; early token errors can cascade, which creates a clear need for self-reflection mechanisms. However, existing self-reflection either performs revisions over full drafts or learns self-correction via expensive training, both fundamentally reactive and inefficient. To address this, we propose Self-Reflective Generation at Test Time (SRGen), a lightweight test-time framework that reflects before generating at uncertain points. During token generation, SRGen utilizes dynamic entropy thresholding to identify high-uncertainty tokens. For each identified token, it trains a specific corrective vector, which fully exploits the already generated context for a self-reflective generation to correct the token probability distribution. By retrospectively analyzing the partial output, this self-reflection enables more trustworthy decisions, thereby significantly reducing the probability of errors at highly uncertain points. Evaluated on challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks and a diverse set of LLMs, SRGen can consistently strengthen model reasoning: improvements in single-pass quality also translate into stronger self-consistency voting. Especially, on AIME2024 with DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B, SRGen yields absolute improvements of +12.0% on Pass@1 and +13.3% on Cons@5. Moreover, our findings position SRGen as a plug-and-play method that integrates reflection into the generation process for reliable LLM reasoning, achieving consistent gains with bounded overhead and broad composability with other training-time (e.g., RLHF) and test-time (e.g., SLOT) techniques.",

While existing solvers rely on information-theoretic entropy maximization or frequency-based heuristics without formal constraint treatment, we present the first comprehensive CSP formulation of Wordle with novel constraint-aware solving strategies. We introduce CSP-Aware Entropy, computing information gain after constraint propagation rather than on raw candidate sets, and a Probabilistic CSP framework integrating Bayesian word-frequency priors with logical constraints. Through evaluation on 2,315 English words, CSP-Aware Entropy achieves 3.54 average guesses with 99.9% success rate, a statistically significant 1.7% improvement over Forward Checking (t=-4.82, p<0.001, Cohen's d=0.07) with 46% faster runtime (12.9ms versus 23.7ms per guess). Under 10% noise, CSP-aware approaches maintain 5.3 percentage point advantages (29.0% versus 23.7%, p=0.041), while Probabilistic CSP achieves 100% success across all noise levels (0-20%) through constraint recovery mechanisms. Cross-lexicon validation on 500 Spanish words demonstrates 88% success with zero language-specific tuning, validating that core CSP principles transfer across languages despite an 11.2 percentage point gap from linguistic differences (p<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Our open-source implementation with 34 unit tests achieving 91% code coverage provides reproducible infrastructure for CSP research. The combination of formal CSP treatment, constraint-aware heuristics, probabilistic-logical integration, robustness analysis, and cross-lexicon validation establishes new performance benchmarks demonstrating that principled constraint satisfaction techniques outperform classical information-theoretic and learning-based approaches for structured puzzle-solving domains.",

A critical paradox was revealed: models excelled at taxonomic classification (94.9%) but consistently failed at conservation reasoning (27.2% for status assessment). This knowledge-reasoning gap, evident across all models, suggests inherent architectural constraints, not just data limitations. Furthermore, models exhibited systematic biases favoring charismatic vertebrates, potentially amplifying existing conservation inequities. These findings delineate clear boundaries for responsible LLM deployment: they are powerful tools for information retrieval but require human oversight for judgment-based decisions. A hybrid approach is recommended, where LLMs augment expert capacity while human experts retain sole authority over risk assessment and policy.",

Yet, challenges persist in integrating iterative reasoning steps with external knowledge retrieval. To address this, we introduce StepChain GraphRAG, a framework that unites question decomposition with a Breadth-First Search (BFS) Reasoning Flow for enhanced multi-hop QA. Our approach first builds a global index over the corpus; at inference time, only retrieved passages are parsed on-the-fly into a knowledge graph, and the complex query is split into sub-questions. For each sub-question, a BFS-based traversal dynamically expands along relevant edges, assembling explicit evidence chains without overwhelming the language model with superfluous context. Experiments on MuSiQue, 2WikiMultiHopQA, and HotpotQA show that StepChain GraphRAG achieves state-of-the-art Exact Match and F1 scores. StepChain GraphRAG lifts average EM by 2.57% and F1 by 2.13% over the SOTA method, achieving the largest gain on HotpotQA (+4.70% EM, +3.44% F1). StepChain GraphRAG also fosters enhanced explainability by preserving the chain-of-thought across intermediate retrieval steps. We conclude by discussing how future work can mitigate the computational overhead and address potential hallucinations from large language models to refine efficiency and reliability in multi-hop QA.",

        "summary": "Personality refers to individual differences in behavior, thinking, and feeling. With the growing availability of digital footprints, especially from social media, automated methods for personality assessment have become increasingly important. Natural language processing (NLP) enables the analysis of unstructured text data to identify personality indicators. However, two main challenges remain central to this thesis: the scarcity of large, personality-labeled datasets and the disconnect between personality psychology and NLP, which restricts model validity and interpretability. To address these challenges, this thesis presents two datasets -- MBTI9k and PANDORA -- collected from Reddit, a platform known for user anonymity and diverse discussions. The PANDORA dataset contains 17 million comments from over 10,000 users and integrates the MBTI and Big Five personality models with demographic information, overcoming limitations in data size, quality, and label coverage. Experiments on these datasets show that demographic variables influence model validity. In response, the SIMPA (Statement-to-Item Matching Personality Assessment) framework was developed - a computational framework for interpretable personality assessment that matches user-generated statements with validated questionnaire items. By using machine learning and semantic similarity, SIMPA delivers personality assessments comparable to human evaluations while maintaining high interpretability and efficiency. Although focused on personality assessment, SIMPA's versatility extends beyond this domain. Its model-agnostic design, layered cue detection, and scalability make it suitable for various research and practical applications involving complex label taxonomies and variable cue associations with target concepts.",

This dual mechanism enables XTRA to learn topics that are interpretable (coherent and diverse) and well-aligned across languages.

To minimize data dependency, we introduce two novel mechanisms grounded in self-awareness: (1) self-aware difficulty prediction, where the model learns to assess task difficulty relative to its own abilities and prioritize challenging yet solvable tasks, and (2) self-aware limit breaking, where the model recognizes when a task is beyond its capability boundary and proactively requests external data to break through that limit.

Recently, various multimodal entity linking (MEL) techniques have been proposed, targeted to learn comprehensive embeddings by leveraging both text and vision modalities. The selection of high-quality negative samples can potentially play a crucial role in metric/representation learning. However, to the best of our knowledge, this possibility remains unexplored in existing literature within the framework of MEL. To fill this gap, we address the multimodal entity linking problem in a generative adversarial setting where the generator is responsible for generating high-quality negative samples, and the discriminator is assigned the responsibility for the metric learning tasks. Since the generator is involved in generating samples, which is a discrete process, we optimize it using policy gradient techniques and propose a policy gradient-based generative adversarial network for multimodal entity linking (PGMEL). Experimental results based on Wiki-MEL, Richpedia-MEL and WikiDiverse datasets demonstrate that PGMEL learns meaningful representation by selecting challenging negative samples and outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",

In this work, we present the first comprehensive survival analysis of conversational AI robustness, analyzing 36,951 conversation turns across 9 state-of-the-art LLMs to model failure as a time-to-event process. Our survival modeling framework-employing Cox proportional hazards, Accelerated Failure Time, and Random Survival Forest approaches-reveals extraordinary temporal dynamics. We find that abrupt, prompt-to-prompt(P2P) semantic drift is catastrophic, dramatically increasing the hazard of conversational failure. In stark contrast, gradual, cumulative drift is highly protective, vastly reducing the failure hazard and enabling significantly longer dialogues. AFT models with interactions demonstrate superior performance, achieving excellent discrimination and exceptional calibration. These findings establish survival analysis as a powerful paradigm for evaluating LLM robustness, offer concrete insights for designing resilient conversational agents, and challenge prevailing assumptions about the necessity of semantic consistency in conversational AI Systems.",

        "summary": "Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) research has primarily focused on closed-book factual question answering (QA), while contextual QA remains unexplored, despite its importance in real-world applications. In this work, we focus on UQ for the contextual QA task and propose a theoretically grounded approach to quantify epistemic uncertainty. We begin by introducing a task-agnostic, token-level uncertainty measure defined as the cross-entropy between the predictive distribution of the given model and the unknown true distribution. By decomposing this measure, we isolate the epistemic component and approximate the true distribution by a perfectly prompted, idealized model. We then derive an upper bound for epistemic uncertainty and show that it can be interpreted as semantic feature gaps in the given model's hidden representations relative to the ideal model. We further apply this generic framework to the contextual QA task and hypothesize that three features approximate this gap: context-reliance (using the provided context rather than parametric knowledge), context comprehension (extracting relevant information from context), and honesty (avoiding intentional lies). Using a top-down interpretability approach, we extract these features by using only a small number of labeled samples and ensemble them to form a robust uncertainty score. Experiments on multiple QA benchmarks in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution settings show that our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised (sampling-free and sampling-based) and supervised UQ methods, achieving up to a 13-point PRR improvement while incurring a negligible inference overhead.",

To this end, we propose Structured-of-Thought (SoT), a training-free method that improves the performance on multilingual reasoning through a multi-step transformation: Language Thinking Transformation and Structured Knowledge Transformation. The SoT method converts language-specific semantic information into language-agnostic structured representations, enabling the models to understand the query in different languages more sophisticated. Besides, SoT effectively guides LLMs toward more concentrated reasoning to maintain consistent underlying reasoning pathways when handling cross-lingual variations in expression. Experimental results demonstrate that SoT outperforms several strong baselines on multiple multilingual reasoning benchmarks when adapting to various backbones of LLMs. It can also be integrated with other training-free strategies for further improvements.

In this study, we present empirical evidence that users adopt distinct communication styles when users interact with chatbots versus human agents. Our analysis reveals significant differences in grammatical fluency, politeness, and lexical diversity in user language between the two settings. These findings suggest that models trained exclusively on human-human interaction data may not adequately accommodate the communication style shift that occurs once an LLM chatbot is deployed. To enhance LLM robustness to post-launch communication style changes, we experimented with two strategies: (1) data augmentation during the post-training phase and (2) inference-time user message reformulation. Our results indicate that models trained on stylistically diverse datasets significantly outperform those trained exclusively on original or stylistically uniform datasets, while inference-time reformulation proved less effective.

Highlight explanations (HEs) offer a natural solution as they can point the exact context pieces and tokens that influenced model outputs. However, no existing work evaluates their effectiveness in accurately explaining context utilisation. We address this gap by introducing the first gold standard HE evaluation framework for context attribution, using controlled test cases with known ground-truth context usage, which avoids the limitations of existing indirect proxy evaluations. To demonstrate the framework's broad applicability, we evaluate four HE methods -- three established techniques and MechLight, a mechanistic interpretability approach we adapt for this task -- across four context scenarios, four datasets, and five LMs. Overall, we find that MechLight performs best across all context scenarios. However, all methods struggle with longer contexts and exhibit positional biases, pointing to fundamental challenges in explanation accuracy that require new approaches to deliver reliable context utilisation explanations at scale.",

By finding the nearest decoder LM token to an MA representation, we uncover two strategies for MA representations. For models using a Whisper encoder, MAs appear to represent the meaning of the input using an English-based interlingua, allowing them to handle languages unseen in instruction tuning. For models that don't, like Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct, MAs instead represent the phonetics of the input, but expressed with English words.

However, evaluating RAG systems remains a challenging task. Traditional evaluation metrics struggle to effectively capture the key features of modern LLM-generated content that often exhibits high fluency and naturalness. Inspired by the RAGAS tool, a well-known RAG evaluation framework, we extended this framework into a KG-based evaluation paradigm, enabling multi-hop reasoning and semantic community clustering to derive more comprehensive scoring metrics. By incorporating these comprehensive evaluation criteria, we gain a deeper understanding of RAG systems and a more nuanced perspective on their performance. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we compare its performance with RAGAS scores and construct a human-annotated subset to assess the correlation between human judgments and automated metrics. In addition, we conduct targeted experiments to demonstrate that our KG-based evaluation method is more sensitive to subtle semantic differences in generated outputs.

We instantiate two inference approaches: a generalized best-first search and a lightweight path-sum ranker. We evaluate our approaches on MS MARCO and QQP with encoder (e.g., BERT/T5) and decoder (GPT-2) representations. Our results show that our retrieval approaches match the dot product search on strong encoder embeddings while remaining robust when kNN degrades: with GPT-2 vectors, dot product performance collapses whereas our approaches still retrieve relevant results.

Our approach starts with the observation that most domains of interest, such as natural language syntax, coding languages, arithmetic problems, are captured by probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs). We study the learning dynamics of small models trained on synthetic languages generated from PCFGs, enabling precise control over grammar complexity, recursion depth, and subgrammar structure. We prove several general, recursive formulae for the training loss and Kullback-Leibler divergence over the subgrammar structure of a PCFG. Empirically, we find that unlike children, who first master simple substructures before progressing to more complex constructions, transformers reduce loss across all subgrammars in parallel. We further show that subgrammar pretraining can improve the final loss for smaller models, and that pretrained models develop internal representations more aligned with the grammar's substructure. Finally, we demonstrate that models struggle with deeper recursive structures (a limitation even of large language models), revealing fundamental challenges in how neural networks represent hierarchical syntax. Overall, our work initiates the study of the learning dynamics of transformers on PCFGs as a versatile testbed for probing learning in language models, opening a research direction with many open questions.",

When a sensory prompt tells the model to 'see' or 'hear', it cues the model to resolve its next-token predictions as if they were conditioned on latent visual or auditory evidence that is never actually supplied.

We present retrieval of relevant structured domain statements given a user query using sub-string level match. We evaluate on eleven realistic DB schemas covering diverse domains across five open-source and proprietary LLMs and demonstrate that (1) DB level structured domain statements are more practical and accurate than existing ad-hoc query specific textual domain statements, and (2) Our sub-string match based retrieval of relevant domain statements provides significantly higher accuracy than other retrieval approaches.",

However, the knowledge updating mechanism of LLMs remains largely unexplored due to insufficient, isolated, and small-scale evaluation.

This paper proposes KnowledgeSmith, a unified framework to systematically understand the updating mechanism of LLMs. We first cast editing and unlearning as instances of one constrained optimization problem. Then, we propose an automatic dataset generator that provides structured interventions across multiple graph levels and data scales, enabling controlled studies of how different modification strategies propagate through model knowledge. Extensive experiments demonstrate nuanced insights over knowledge propagation, plasticity scaling, consistency, and robustness. For instance, our results show that LLMs do not exhibit similar updating as humans for different levels of knowledge, and there exists consistency-capacity trade-off.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this limitation by enriching LLMs with external knowledge, but existing systems primarily rely on unstructured documents, while largely overlooking relational databases, which provide precise, timely, and efficiently queryable factual information, serving as indispensable infrastructure in domains such as finance, healthcare, and scientific research. Motivated by this gap, we conduct a systematic analysis that reveals three central observations: (i) databases and documents offer complementary strengths across queries, (ii) naively combining both sources introduces noise and cost without consistent accuracy gains, and (iii) selecting the most suitable source for each query is crucial to balance effectiveness and efficiency. We further observe that query types show consistent regularities in their alignment with retrieval paths, suggesting that routing decisions can be effectively guided by systematic rules that capture these patterns. Building on these insights, we propose a rule-driven routing framework. A routing agent scores candidate augmentation paths based on explicit rules and selects the most suitable one; a rule-making expert agent refines the rules over time using QA feedback to maintain adaptability; and a path-level meta-cache reuses past routing decisions for semantically similar queries to reduce latency and cost. Experiments on three QA benchmarks demonstrate that our framework consistently outperforms static strategies and learned routing baselines, achieving higher accuracy while maintaining moderate computational cost.",

Yet compressing all world knowledge into parameters is unnecessary, as only a fraction is used per prompt, and impractical for edge devices with limited inference-time memory and compute. We address this shortcoming by a memory-augmented architecture and a pretraining strategy aligned with existing hardware paradigms. We introduce small language models that access large hierarchical parametric memory banks encoding world knowledge. During pretraining and inference, we fetch a small, context-dependent memory block and add it to the model. Our pretraining learns to store long-tail world knowledge in the memory parameters, while the small language model acts as an anchor capturing common knowledge and general reasoning abilities. Through trillion-token-scale experiments, we show significant gains: a 160M-parameters model augmented with an 18M-parameters memory fetched from a 4.6B memory bank obtains comparable performance to a regular model with more than 2x the parameters. Through extensive experiments, we study the optimal type and size of parametric memories in transformers, scaling them to over 21B parameters.

Models that accept external knowledge uncritically are vulnerable to misinformation, whereas models that adhere rigidly to parametric knowledge fail to benefit from retrieval. Despite the widespread adoption of retrieval-augmented generation, we still lack a systematic understanding of what shapes knowledge-arbitration strategies during training. This gap risks producing pretrained models with undesirable arbitration behaviors and, consequently, wasting substantial computational resources after the pretraining budget has already been spent. To address this problem, we present the first controlled study of how training conditions influence models' use of in-context and parametric knowledge, and how they arbitrate between them. We train transformer-based language models on a synthetic biographies corpus while systematically controlling various conditions. Our experiments reveal that intra-document repetition of facts fosters the development of both parametric and in-context capabilities. Moreover, training on a corpus that contains inconsistent information or distributional skew encourages models to develop robust strategies for leveraging parametric and in-context knowledge. Rather than viewing these non-ideal properties as artifacts to remove, our results indicate that they are important for learning robust arbitration. These insights offer concrete, empirical guidance for pretraining models that harmoniously integrate parametric and in-context knowledge.",

        "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents typically receive two kinds of context: (i) environment-level manuals that define interaction interfaces and global rules, and (ii) task-level guidance or demonstrations tied to specific goals. In this work, we identify a crucial but overlooked third type of context, instance-level context, which consists of verifiable and reusable facts tied to a specific environment instance, such as object locations, crafting recipes, and local rules. We argue that the absence of instance-level context is a common source of failure for LLM agents in complex tasks, as success often depends not only on reasoning over global rules or task prompts but also on making decisions based on precise and persistent facts. Acquiring such context requires more than memorization: the challenge lies in efficiently exploring, validating, and formatting these facts under tight interaction budgets. We formalize this problem as Instance-Level Context Learning (ILCL) and introduce our task-agnostic method to solve it. Our method performs a guided exploration, using a compact TODO forest to intelligently prioritize its next actions and a lightweight plan-act-extract loop to execute them. This process automatically produces a high-precision context document that is reusable across many downstream tasks and agents, thereby amortizing the initial exploration cost. Experiments across TextWorld, ALFWorld, and Crafter demonstrate consistent gains in both success and efficiency: for instance, ReAct's mean success rate in TextWorld rises from 37% to 95%, while IGE improves from 81% to 95%. By transforming one-off exploration into persistent, reusable knowledge, our method complements existing contexts to enable more reliable and efficient LLM agents.",

        "summary": "In this case study, we select a set of controversial Romanian historical questions and ask multiple Large Language Models to answer them across languages and contexts, in order to assess their biases. Besides being a study mainly performed for educational purposes, the motivation also lies in the recognition that history is often presented through altered perspectives, primarily influenced by the culture and ideals of a state, even through large language models. Since they are often trained on certain data sets that may present certain ambiguities, the lack of neutrality is subsequently instilled in users. The research process was carried out in three stages, to confirm the idea that the type of response expected can influence, to a certain extent, the response itself; after providing an affirmative answer to some given question, an LLM could shift its way of thinking after being asked the same question again, but being told to respond with a numerical value of a scale. Results show that binary response stability is relatively high but far from perfect and varies by language. Models often flip stance across languages or between formats; numeric ratings frequently diverge from the initial binary choice, and the most consistent models are not always those judged most accurate or neutral. Our research brings to light the predisposition of models to such inconsistencies, within a specific contextualization of the language for the question asked.",

        "summary": "Transformer-based large models excel in natural language processing and computer vision, but face severe computational inefficiencies due to the self-attention's quadratic complexity with input tokens. Recently, researchers have proposed a series of methods based on block selection and compression to alleviate this problem, but they either have issues with semantic incompleteness or poor training-inference efficiency. To comprehensively address these challenges, we propose ChunkLLM, a lightweight and pluggable training framework. Specifically, we introduce two components: QK Adapter (Q-Adapter and K-Adapter) and Chunk Adapter. The former is attached to each Transformer layer, serving dual purposes of feature compression and chunk attention acquisition. The latter operates at the bottommost layer of the model, functioning to detect chunk boundaries by leveraging contextual semantic information. During the training phase, the parameters of the backbone remain frozen, with only the QK Adapter and Chunk Adapter undergoing training. Notably, we design an attention distillation method for training the QK Adapter, which enhances the recall rate of key chunks. During the inference phase, chunk selection is triggered exclusively when the current token is detected as a chunk boundary, thereby accelerating model inference. Experimental evaluations are conducted on a diverse set of long-text and short-text benchmark datasets spanning multiple tasks. ChunkLLM not only attains comparable performance on short-text benchmarks but also maintains 98.64% of the performance on long-context benchmarks while preserving a 48.58% key-value cache retention rate. Particularly, ChunkLLM attains a maximum speedup of 4.48x in comparison to the vanilla Transformer in the processing of 120K long texts.",

        "summary": "The Spiral of Silence (SoS) theory holds that individuals with minority views often refrain from speaking out for fear of social isolation, enabling majority positions to dominate public discourse. When the 'agents' are large language models (LLMs), however, the classical psychological explanation is not directly applicable, since SoS was developed for human societies. This raises a central question: can SoS-like dynamics nevertheless emerge from purely statistical language generation in LLM collectives? We propose an evaluation framework for examining SoS in LLM agents. Specifically, we consider four controlled conditions that systematically vary the availability of 'History' and 'Persona' signals. Opinion dynamics are assessed using trend tests such as Mann-Kendall and Spearman's rank, along with concentration measures including kurtosis and interquartile range. Experiments across open-source and closed-source models show that history and persona together produce strong majority dominance and replicate SoS patterns; history signals alone induce strong anchoring; and persona signals alone foster diverse but uncorrelated opinions, indicating that without historical anchoring, SoS dynamics cannot emerge. The work bridges computational sociology and responsible AI design, highlighting the need to monitor and mitigate emergent conformity in LLM-agent systems.",

However, emission-related knowledge is often fragmented and highly specialized, while existing methods for accessing and compiling emissions data remain inefficient. These issues hinder the ability of non-experts to interpret emissions information, posing challenges to research and management. To address this, we present Emission-GPT, a knowledge-enhanced large language model agent tailored for the atmospheric emissions domain. Built on a curated knowledge base of over 10,000 documents (including standards, reports, guidebooks, and peer-reviewed literature), Emission-GPT integrates prompt engineering and question completion to support accurate domain-specific question answering. Emission-GPT also enables users to interactively analyze emissions data via natural language, such as querying and visualizing inventories, analyzing source contributions, and recommending emission factors for user-defined scenarios. A case study in Guangdong Province demonstrates that Emission-GPT can extract key insights--such as point source distributions and sectoral trends--directly from raw data with simple prompts. Its modular and extensible architecture facilitates automation of traditionally manual workflows, positioning Emission-GPT as a foundational tool for next-generation emission inventory development and scenario-based assessment.",

        "summary": "As large language models (LLMs) scale up, accuracy improves, but the autoregressive (AR) nature of decoding increases latency since each token requires a serial forward pass. Speculative decoding addresses this by employing a fast drafter to propose multi-token drafts, which are then verified in parallel by the target model. However, many deployments still rely on AR drafters, where sequential passes limit wall-clock gains. We revisit the drafting stage and present DiffuSpec, a training-free drop-in framework that uses a pretrained diffusion language model (DLM) to produce multi-token drafts in a single forward pass, while remaining compatible with standard AR verifiers. Because DLM drafts are generated under bidirectional conditioning, parallel per-position candidates form a token lattice in which the locally highest-probability token at each position need not form a causal left-to-right path. Moreover, DLM drafting requires pre-specifying a draft length, inducing a speed-quality trade-off. To address these challenges, we introduce two practical components: (i) a causal-consistency path search (CPS) over this lattice that extracts a left-to-right path aligned with AR verification; and (ii) an adaptive draft-length (ADL) controller that adjusts next proposal size based on recent acceptance feedback and realized generated length. Across benchmarks, DiffuSpec yields up to 3x wall-clock speedup, establishing diffusion-based drafting as a robust alternative to autoregressive drafters for speculative decoding.",

Here, we searched for abstract representations of meaning in the language cortex by modeling neural responses to sentences using representations from vision and language models. When we generate images corresponding to sentences and extract vision model embeddings, we find that aggregating across multiple generated images yields increasingly accurate predictions of language cortex responses, sometimes rivaling large language models. Similarly, averaging embeddings across multiple paraphrases of a sentence improves prediction accuracy compared to any single paraphrase. Enriching paraphrases with contextual details that may be implicit (e.g., augmenting \"I had a pancake\" to include details like \"maple syrup\") further increases prediction accuracy, even surpassing predictions based on the embedding of the original sentence, suggesting that the language system maintains richer and broader semantic representations than language models. Together, these results demonstrate the existence of highly abstract, form-independent meaning representations within the language cortex.",

Paralinguistic features, such as age, gender, and accent, can affect model outputs; when compounded by multi-turn conversations, these effects may exacerbate biases, with potential implications for fairness in decision-making and recommendation tasks. In this paper, we systematically evaluate biases in speech LLMs and study the impact of multi-turn dialogues with repeated negative feedback. Bias is measured using Group Unfairness Score (GUS) for decisions and similarity-based normalized statistics rate (SNSR) for recommendations, across both open-source models like Qwen2.5-Omni and GLM-4-Voice, as well as closed-source APIs such as GPT-4o Audio and Gemini-2.5-Flash. Our analysis reveals that closed-source models generally exhibit lower bias, while open-source models are more sensitive to age and gender, and recommendation tasks tend to amplify cross-group disparities. We found that biased decisions may persist in multi-turn conversations. This work provides the first systematic study of biases in end-to-end spoken dialogue models, offering insights towards fair and reliable audio-based interactive systems.

We introduce a unified framework based on dynamic expert clustering and structured compression to address these issues cohesively. Our method employs an online clustering procedure that periodically regroups experts using a fused metric of parameter and activation similarity, which stabilizes expert utilization. To our knowledge, this is one of the first frameworks to leverage the semantic embedding capability of the router to dynamically reconfigure the model's architecture during training for substantial efficiency gains. Within each cluster, we decompose expert weights into a shared base matrix and extremely low-rank residual adapters, achieving up to fivefold parameter reduction per group while preserving specialization. This structure enables a two-stage hierarchical routing strategy: tokens are first assigned to a cluster, then to specific experts within it, drastically reducing the routing search space and the volume of all-to-all communication. Furthermore, a heterogeneous precision scheme, which stores shared bases in FP16 and residual factors in INT4, coupled with dynamic offloading of inactive clusters, reduces peak memory consumption to levels comparable to dense models. Evaluated on GLUE and WikiText-103, our framework matches the quality of standard MoE models while reducing total parameters by approximately 80%, improving throughput by 10% to 20%, and lowering expert load variance by a factor of over three. Our work demonstrates that structural reorganization is a principled path toward scalable, efficient, and memory-effective MoE LLMs.",

We address this gap by introducing SIMPACT, the SIMulation-oriented Persona and Action Capture Toolkit, a privacy respecting framework for constructing behaviorally-grounded social media datasets suitable for training agent models. We formulate next-action prediction as a task for training and evaluating LLM-based agents and introduce metrics at both the cluster and population levels to assess behavioral fidelity and stylistic realism. As a concrete implementation, we release BluePrint, a large-scale dataset built from public Bluesky data focused on political discourse. BluePrint clusters anonymized users into personas of aggregated behaviours, capturing authentic engagement patterns while safeguarding privacy through pseudonymization and removal of personally identifiable information. The dataset includes a sizable action set of 12 social media interaction types (likes, replies, reposts, etc.), each instance tied to the posting activity preceding it. This supports the development of agents that use context-dependence, not only in the language, but also in the interaction behaviours of social media to model social media users. By standardizing data and evaluation protocols, SIMPACT provides a foundation for advancing rigorous, ethically responsible social media simulations. BluePrint serves as both an evaluation benchmark for political discourse modeling and a template for building domain specific datasets to study challenges such as misinformation and polarization.",

        "summary": "Real-world large language model deployments (e.g., conversational AI systems, code generation assistants) naturally generate abundant implicit user dissatisfaction (DSAT) signals, as users iterate toward better answers through refinements, corrections, and expressed preferences, while explicit satisfaction (SAT) feedback is scarce. Existing preference learning approaches are poorly aligned with this data profile, as they rely on costly human annotations or assume plentiful positive responses. In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{DRIFT} (\\textbf{D}issatisfaction-\\textbf{R}efined \\textbf{I}terative pre\\textbf{F}erence \\textbf{T}raining), which anchors training on real-world DSAT signals and samples positives dynamically from the evolving policy. Empirically, DRIFT models trained on real-world \\textit{WildFeedback} datasets and synthetic \\textit{UltraFeedback} datasets achieve up to +6.23\\% (7B) / +7.61\\% (14B) on WildBench Task Score and up to +8.95\\% (7B) / +12.29\\% (14B) on AlpacaEval2 win rate over base models, outperforming strong baseline methods such as iterative DPO and SPIN. At larger scales, the improvements are particularly pronounced: 14B models trained with DRIFT surpass GPT-4o-mini on WildBench. Further analysis shows that DRIFT also preserves exploratory capacity, yielding more diverse high-reward solutions rather than collapsing to narrow subsets. Theoretically, we demonstrate that this design preserves preference margins and avoids the gradient degeneration. These results show that DRIFT is an effective and scalable recipe for real-world post-training that leverages the most abundant and informative signal.

With the recent emergence of prompting-based unlearning techniques, a natural question arises: Can LLMs be prompted to simulate an earlier knowledge cutoff? In this work, we investigate the capability of prompting to simulate earlier knowledge cutoff in LLMs. We construct three evaluation datasets to assess the extent to which LLMs can forget (1) direct factual knowledge, (2) semantic shifts, and (3) causally related knowledge. Results demonstrate that while prompt-based simulated knowledge cutoffs show effectiveness when directly queried with the information after that date, they struggle to induce forgetting when the forgotten content is not directly asked but causally related to the query. These findings highlight the need for more rigorous evaluation settings when applying LLMs for temporal prediction tasks.

Our method directly optimizes factual grounding and completeness without training a separate reward model or relying on human-authored references. Empirically, the approach improves clinical note quality and reduces training cost via a simple reward-gating strategy. An independent GPT-5 qualitative evaluation further supports these gains, showing higher preference for GRPO outputs in factuality, completeness, and brevity, with fewer omissions and hallucinations. Because the benchmarks are relatively clean and the base model already well aligned, these improvements likely represent a conservative lower bound. The framework is scalable to real-world settings and can incorporate custom objectives such as guideline adherence or billing preferences.",

To study this problem, we introduce FormalML, a Lean 4 benchmark built from foundational theories of machine learning. Using a translation tactic that converts procedural proofs into declarative form, we extract 4937 problems spanning optimization and probability inequalities, with varying levels of difficulty. FormalML is the first subgoal completion benchmark to combine premise retrieval and complex research-level contexts.

Existing attribution methods, particularly those based on parameter gradients, often fall short due to prohibitive noisy signals and computational complexity. In this work, we introduce a novel and efficient framework that diagnoses a range of undesirable LLM behaviors by analyzing representation and its gradients, which operates directly in the model's activation space to provide a semantically meaningful signal linking outputs to their training data. We systematically evaluate our method for tasks that include tracking harmful content, detecting backdoor poisoning, and identifying knowledge contamination. The results demonstrate that our approach not only excels at sample-level attribution but also enables fine-grained token-level analysis, precisely identifying the specific samples and phrases that causally influence model behavior.

A fundamental challenge in this ffeld stems from tokenization ambiguity in modern tokenizers, which can lead to catastrophic decoding failures. The recent method, SyncPool, addresses this ambiguity by employing a coarse-grained synchronization mechanism over groups of ambiguous candidates. However, SyncPool sacriffces embedding capacity, as it utilizes the entire Shannon entropy of an ambiguous group solely for synchronization rather than for payload embedding. We propose a method named look-ahead Sync, which overcomes the capacity limitation of SyncPool while retaining its provable security guarantees. Our approach performs minimal synchronized sampling only on truly indistinguishable token sequences, while strategically preserving all other discernible paths to maximize embedding capacity. We provide theoretical proofs for the security of our method and analyze the gap between its achievable embedding capacity and the theoretical upper bound. Experiments on English (using Llama 3) and Chinese (using Qwen 2.5) benchmarks show that our method consistently approaches the theoretical capacity upper bound and signiffcantly outperforms SyncPool. The improvement in embedding rate exceeds 160% in English and 25% in Chinese, particularly in settings with larger candidate pools. This work represents a signiffcant step toward practical high-capacity provably secure linguistic steganography.",

To address this, we develop a methodology for generating natural dialogues that are consistent with a user's underlying state using behavior simulators together with LM-prompting.

We construct training samples with long-range dependencies by combining original documents with these verified contextual supplements.

This paper introduces a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the gap between these two paradigms. Our framework processes user speech through an S2S transformer for immediate responsiveness while concurrently relaying the query to a powerful back-end LLM. The LLM's text-based response is then injected in real time to guide the S2S model's speech generation, effectively infusing its output with rich knowledge without the full latency penalty of a cascaded system. We evaluated our method using a speech-synthesized variant of the MT-Bench benchmark that consists of multi-turn question-answering sessions. The results demonstrate that our system substantially outperforms a baseline S2S model in response correctness, approaching that of a cascaded system, while maintaining a latency on par with the baseline.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit impressive capabilities but often hallucinate, confidently providing incorrect answers instead of admitting ignorance. Prior work has shown that models encode linear representations of their own knowledge and that activation steering can reduce hallucinations. These approaches, however, require real-time monitoring and intervention during inference. We introduce Contrastive Activation Steering for Amortized Learning (CASAL), an efficient algorithm that connects interpretability with amortized optimization. CASAL directly bakes the benefits of activation steering into model's weights. Once trained, LLMs answer questions they know while abstaining from answering those they do not. CASAL's light-weight design requires training only a submodule of a single transformer layer and yet reduces hallucination by 30%-40% across multiple short-form QA benchmarks. CASAL is 30x more compute-efficient and 20x more data-efficient than strong LoRA-based baselines such as SFT and DPO, boosting its practical applicability in data scarce domains. Importantly, CASAL also generalizes effectively to out-of-distribution (OOD) domains. We showcase CASAL's flexibility in mitigating hallucinations in both text-only and vision-language models. To our knowledge, CASAL is the first steering-based training method that has been shown to be effective for both dense and Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models. CASAL represents a promising step forward for applying interpretability-inspired method for practical deployment in production systems.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has propelled Large Language Models in complex reasoning, yet its scalability is often hindered by a training bottleneck where performance plateaus as policy entropy collapses, signaling a loss of exploration. Previous methods typically address this by maintaining high policy entropy, yet the precise mechanisms that govern meaningful exploration have remained underexplored. Our analysis suggests that an unselective focus on entropy risks amplifying irrelevant tokens and destabilizing training. This paper investigates the exploration dynamics within RLVR and identifies a key issue: the gradual elimination of valuable low-probability exploratory tokens, which we term \\textbf{\\textit{reasoning sparks}}. We find that while abundant in pre-trained models, these sparks are systematically extinguished during RLVR due to over-penalization, leading to a degeneracy in exploration. To address this, we introduce Low-probability Regularization (Lp-Reg). Its core mechanism regularizes the policy towards a heuristic proxy distribution. This proxy is constructed by filtering out presumed noise tokens and re-normalizing the distribution over the remaining candidates. The result is a less-noisy proxy where the probability of \\textit{reasoning sparks} is amplified, which then serves as a soft regularization target to shield these valuable tokens from elimination via KL divergence. Experiments show that Lp-Reg enables stable on-policy training for around 1,000 steps, a regime where baseline entropy-control methods collapse. This sustained exploration leads to state-of-the-art performance, achieving a $60.17\\%$ average accuracy on five math benchmarks, an improvement of $2.66\\%$ over prior methods.

        "summary": "Diffusion language models, especially masked discrete diffusion models, have achieved great success recently. While there are some theoretical and primary empirical results showing the advantages of latent reasoning with looped transformers or continuous chain-of-thoughts, continuous diffusion models typically underperform their discrete counterparts. In this paper, we argue that diffusion language models do not necessarily need to be in the discrete space. In particular, we prove that continuous diffusion models have stronger expressivity than discrete diffusions and looped transformers. We attribute the contradiction between the theoretical expressiveness and empirical performance to their practical trainability: while continuous diffusion provides intermediate supervision that looped transformers lack, they introduce additional difficulty decoding tokens into the discrete token space from the continuous representation space. We therefore propose Coevolutionary Continuous Discrete Diffusion (CCDD), which defines a joint multimodal diffusion process on the union of a continuous representation space and a discrete token space, leveraging a single model to simultaneously denoise in the joint space. By combining two modalities, CCDD is expressive with rich semantics in the latent space, as well as good trainability and sample quality with the help of explicit discrete tokens. We also propose effective architectures and advanced training/sampling techniques for CCDD, which reveals strong empirical performance in extensive language modeling experiments on real-world tasks.",

        "summary": "Vision Language Models (VLMs) show strong potential for visual planning but struggle with precise spatial and long-horizon reasoning. In contrast, Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) planners excel at long-horizon formal planning, but cannot interpret visual inputs. Recent works combine these complementary advantages by enabling VLMs to turn visual planning problems into PDDL files for formal planning. However, while VLMs can generate PDDL problem files satisfactorily, they struggle to accurately generate the PDDL domain files, which describe all the planning rules. As a result, prior methods rely on human experts to predefine domain files or on constant environment access for refinement. We propose VLMFP, a Dual-VLM-guided framework that can autonomously generate both PDDL problem and domain files for formal visual planning. VLMFP introduces two VLMs to ensure reliable PDDL file generation: A SimVLM that simulates action consequences based on input rule descriptions, and a GenVLM that generates and iteratively refines PDDL files by comparing the PDDL and SimVLM execution results. VLMFP unleashes multiple levels of generalizability: The same generated PDDL domain file works for all the different instances under the same problem, and VLMs generalize to different problems with varied appearances and rules. We evaluate VLMFP with 6 grid-world domains and test its generalization to unseen instances, appearance, and game rules. On average, SimVLM accurately describes 95.5%, 82.6% of scenarios, simulates 85.5%, 87.8% of action sequence, and judges 82.4%, 85.6% goal reaching for seen and unseen appearances, respectively. With the guidance of SimVLM, VLMFP can generate PDDL files to reach 70.0%, 54.1% valid plans for unseen instances in seen and unseen appearances, respectively.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve strong results on code tasks, but how they derive program meaning remains unclear. We argue that code communicates through two channels: structural semantics, which define formal behavior, and human-interpretable naming, which conveys intent. Removing the naming channel severely degrades intent-level tasks such as summarization, where models regress to line-by-line descriptions. Surprisingly, we also observe consistent reductions on execution tasks that should depend only on structure, revealing that current benchmarks reward memorization of naming patterns rather than genuine semantic reasoning. To disentangle these effects, we introduce a suite of semantics-preserving obfuscations and show that they expose identifier leakage across both summarization and execution. Building on these insights, we release ClassEval-Obf, an obfuscation-enhanced benchmark that systematically suppresses naming cues while preserving behavior. Our results demonstrate that ClassEval-Obf reduces inflated performance gaps, weakens memorization shortcuts, and provides a more reliable basis for assessing LLMs' code understanding and generalization.",

        "summary": "Although recent tool-augmented benchmarks incorporate complex user requests and diverse tools, the evaluation methods for most of them remain limited to answer matching. However, as the number of steps required to resolve a user request increases, a proper evaluation of an agent's performance must go beyond the final answer to also assess the problem-solving trajectory, including previously ignored aspects such as efficiency, hallucination, and adaptivity. The most straightforward method for evaluating these aspects is to compare an agent's trajectory with the ground-truth trajectory, but this approach is fundamentally limited since annotating all valid ground-truth trajectories is prohibitively expensive. However, a simple LLM-based evaluator struggles to assess trajectories in detail without ground truth. To effectively evaluate the agents in this manner, we introduce TRACE, a framework for the multi-dimensional evaluation of tool-augmented LLM agent performance. By incorporating an evidence bank, which accumulates knowledge gathered from preceding reasoning steps, TRACE enables a multi-faceted analysis and evaluation of an agent's reasoning trajectory effectively. To validate our framework, we develop a new meta-evaluation dataset by augmenting existing benchmarks with diverse and flawed trajectories, each labeled with multi-faceted performance scores. Our results confirm that TRACE accurately evaluates these complex behaviors in a scalable and cost-effective manner, even with small open-source LLMs. Furthermore, we apply our method to evaluate the trajectories that agents produce while solving tool-augmented tasks, presenting previously unreported observations and their corresponding insights.",

Li, Raman and Tewari (2024) and Charikar and Pabbaraju (2024) showed strong non-uniform generation guarantees in this model, giving algorithms that generate new valid strings from $L$ after seeing a number of distinct input strings $t(L)$ that depends only on $L$ (and the collection), but not the enumeration order. However, for both these works, the language-wise generation times $t(L)$ of the algorithm can be strictly sub-optimal. In this work, we study Pareto-optimality of non-uniform language generation in the limit. We propose an algorithm, whose generation times $t^\\star(L)$ are (almost) Pareto-optimal: any other algorithm whose generation time for some language $L$ is strictly smaller than $t^\\star(L)$, must satisfy that its generation time for some other language $L'$ is strictly worse than $t^\\star(L')$. Pareto-optimality is essentially the best that one can achieve for non-uniform generation. Our algorithmic framework conveniently adapts to further give Pareto-optimal non-uniform generation algorithms in the practically motivated settings of noisy as well as representative generation.",

        "summary": "Large vision-language models (LVLMs) have shown remarkable performance in visual-language understanding for downstream multimodal tasks. While their capabilities are improving, problems emerge simultaneously. Among those problems, the hallucinations have attracted much attention, which stands for the phenomenon where LVLMs generate contradictory content to their input visual and text contents. Many approaches have been proposed to deal with this issue, such as contrastive decoding and attention manipulation. However, contrastive decoding methods struggle in constructing appropriate contrastive samples, and attention manipulation methods are highly sensitive, lacking stability. In this work, we propose image head Masked Contrastive Decoding (MaskCD). Our approach utilizes the \"image heads\" in LVLMs, masking them to construct contrastive samples for contrastive decoding. We evaluated MaskCD on LLaVA-1.5-7b and Qwen-VL-7b, using various benchmarks such as CHAIR, POPE, AMBER and MME. The results demonstrate that MaskCD effectively alleviates the phenomenon of hallucinations and retains the general capabilities of LVLMs. Corresponding resources could be found at: https://github.com/Deng-Jingyuan/MaskCD .",

The loss surface is complex, but as you approach the optimum simple structure emerges. It becomes characterized by a few basic features, like its effective dimension and the best possible loss. To uncover this asymptotic regime, we develop a novel technique based on random search. Within this regime, the best scores from random search take on a new distribution we discover. Its parameters are exactly the features defining the loss surface in the asymptotic regime. From these features, we derive a new asymptotic law for random search that can explain and extrapolate its convergence.

Small- and mid-sized generators paired with larger corpora often rival much larger models with smaller corpora; mid-sized models tend to gain the most, while tiny and large models benefit less.

AdaLoRA leverages Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to parameterize updates and employs pruning of singular values to introduce dynamic rank allocation, thereby enhancing adaptability. However, during the training process, it often encounters issues of slow convergence speed and high computational overhead. To address this issue, we propose HyperAdaLoRA, a novel framework that accelerates the convergence of AdaLoRA by leveraging a hypernetwork. Instead of directly optimizing the components of Singular Value Decomposition $(P, \\Lambda, Q)$, HyperAdaLoRA employs a hypernetwork based on attention mechanisms to dynamically generate these parameters. By pruning the outputs of the hypernetwork that generates the singular values, dynamic rank allocation is achieved. Comprehensive experiments on various datasets and models demonstrate that our method achieves faster convergence without sacrificing performance.

Prior work shows that increasing the number of samples K steadily improves accuracy. In this paper, we demonstrate that this trend does not hold indefinitely: at large K, further scaling yields no gains, and certain hard questions remain unsolved regardless of the number of traces. Interestingly, we find that different sampling temperatures solve different subsets of problems, implying that single-temperature scaling explores only part of a model's potential. We therefore propose scaling along the temperature dimension, which enlarges the reasoning boundary of LLMs. Averaged over Qwen3 (0.6B, 1.7B, 4B, 8B) and five representative reasoning benchmarks (AIME 2024/2025, MATH500, LiveCodeBench, Hi-ToM), temperature scaling yields an additional 7.3 points over single-temperature TTS. Temperature scaling also enables base models to reach performance comparable to reinforcement learning (RL)-trained counterparts, without additional post-training. We further provide a comprehensive analysis of this phenomenon and design a multi-temperature voting method that reduces the overhead of temperature scaling. Overall, our findings suggest that TTS is more powerful than previously thought, and that temperature scaling offers a simple and effective way to unlock the latent potential of base models.",

However, like large language models (LLMs), video generation models tend to hallucinate, producing plausible videos even when they are factually wrong. Although uncertainty quantification (UQ) of LLMs has been extensively studied in prior work, no UQ method for video models exists, raising critical safety concerns. To our knowledge, this paper represents the first work towards quantifying the uncertainty of video models. We present a framework for uncertainty quantification of generative video models, consisting of: (i) a metric for evaluating the calibration of video models based on robust rank correlation estimation with no stringent modeling assumptions; (ii) a black-box UQ method for video models (termed S-QUBED), which leverages latent modeling to rigorously decompose predictive uncertainty into its aleatoric and epistemic components; and (iii) a UQ dataset to facilitate benchmarking calibration in video models. By conditioning the generation task in the latent space, we disentangle uncertainty arising due to vague task specifications from that arising from lack of knowledge. Through extensive experiments on benchmark video datasets, we demonstrate that S-QUBED computes calibrated total uncertainty estimates that are negatively correlated with the task accuracy and effectively computes the aleatoric and epistemic constituents.",

In this work, we challenge this view by establishing a fundamental equivalence between SFT and Inverse Reinforcement Learning. We prove that the SFT objective is a special case of Inverse Q-Learning, which implies that the SFT process does not just learn a policy, but also an implicit, dense, token-level reward model that explains the expert demonstrations. We then show how to recover this dense reward signal directly from the SFT model by formulating a baseline-relative reward function. The availability of such a dense reward model offers numerous benefits, providing granular credit assignment for each token generated. We demonstrate one key application by using these recovered rewards to further improve the policy with reinforcement learning. Our method, Dense-Path REINFORCE, consistently outperforms the original SFT models on instruction-following benchmarks. This work reframes SFT not merely as policy imitation but as a powerful reward learning mechanism, opening new possibilities for leveraging expert demonstrations.",

In light of these challenges,we introduce Litespark, a novel pre-training framework that addresses these inefficiencies through targeted optimizations to transformer attention and MLP layers. Our approach combines architectural improvements with algorithmic enhancements to maximize Model FLOPs Utilization (MFU) while maintaining compatibility with standard transformer implementations. Comprehensive benchmarking on 3B and 30B parameter Llama models using the SlimPajama-627B dataset demonstrates substantial performance gains: 2x-6x training throughput improvement and $55\\%-83$% energy consumption reduction across multi-node H200 GPU clusters. These optimizations are model- and hardware-agnostic, enabling broad applicability across transformer architectures and extending to post-training phases including supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization.",

However, existing frameworks struggle to generate realistic scenarios efficiently due to limited editing capabilities. To address these challenges, we present SIMSplat, a predictive driving scene editor with language-aligned Gaussian splatting. As a language-controlled editor, SIMSplat enables intuitive manipulation using natural language prompts. By aligning language with Gaussian-reconstructed scenes, it further supports direct querying of road objects, allowing precise and flexible editing. Our method provides detailed object-level editing, including adding new objects and modifying the trajectories of both vehicles and pedestrians, while also incorporating predictive path refinement through multi-agent motion prediction to generate realistic interactions among all agents in the scene. Experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate SIMSplat's extensive editing capabilities and adaptability across a wide range of scenarios. Project page: https://sungyeonparkk.github.io/simsplat/",

While static prompt optimization has shown promise, it produces a single fixed prompt that fails to adapt to different inputs, users, or environments. We introduce Advisor Models, lightweight parametric policies trained with reinforcement learning to reactively issue natural language steering instructions in-context to black-box models. The advisor is a second small model that sits between the input and the model, shaping behavior on a per-instance basis using reward signals from the environment. Across multiple domains involving reasoning and personalization, we show that Advisor Models outperform static prompt optimizers, discovering environment dynamics and improving downstream task performance. We also demonstrate the generalizability of advisors by transferring them across black-box models, as well as the framework's ability to achieve specialization while retaining robustness to out-of-distribution inputs. Viewed more broadly, Advisor Models provide a learnable interface to black-box systems where the advisor acts as a parametric, environment-specific memory. We argue that dynamic optimization of black-box models via Advisor Models is a promising direction for enabling personalization and environment-adaptable AI with frontier-level capabilities.",

Specifically, we synthesize a large-scale dataset (Speech-RATE) of spoken radiology reports and train SpeechCT-CLIP, a contrastive model that aligns speech and 3D CT volumes in a shared representation space. While naive speech-based models underperform compared to text-trained counterparts, we show that knowledge distillation from a pretrained text-image CLIP model effectively transfers semantic alignment capabilities from text to speech, substantially narrowing this gap. Experiments demonstrate improved zero-shot classification F1 from 0.623 to 0.705, recovering 88% of the performance difference, and strong retrieval results without requiring text at inference.

Modern detectors are notoriously vulnerable to adversarial attacks, with paraphrasing standing out as an effective evasion technique that foils statistical detection. This paper presents a comparative study of adversarial robustness, first by quantifying the limitations of standard adversarial training and then by introducing a novel, significantly more resilient detection framework: Perturbation-Invariant Feature Engineering (PIFE), a framework that enhances detection by first transforming input text into a standardized form using a multi-stage normalization pipeline, it then quantifies the transformation's magnitude using metrics like Levenshtein distance and semantic similarity, feeding these signals directly to the classifier. We evaluate both a conventionally hardened Transformer and our PIFE-augmented model against a hierarchical taxonomy of character-, word-, and sentence-level attacks. Our findings first confirm that conventional adversarial training, while resilient to syntactic noise, fails against semantic attacks, an effect we term \"semantic evasion threshold\", where its True Positive Rate at a strict 1% False Positive Rate plummets to 48.8%. In stark contrast, our PIFE model, which explicitly engineers features from the discrepancy between a text and its canonical form, overcomes this limitation. It maintains a remarkable 82.6% TPR under the same conditions, effectively neutralizing the most sophisticated semantic attacks. This superior performance demonstrates that explicitly modeling perturbation artifacts, rather than merely training on them, is a more promising path toward achieving genuine robustness in the adversarial arms race.",

Recent empirical successes have used privileged expert distillation--which leverages availability of latent state information during training (e.g., from a simulator) to learn and imitate the optimal latent, Markovian policy--to disentangle the task of \"learning to see\" from \"learning to act\". While expert distillation is more computationally efficient than RL without latent state information, it also has well-documented failure modes. In this paper--through a simple but instructive theoretical model called the perturbed Block MDP, and controlled experiments on challenging simulated locomotion tasks--we investigate the algorithmic trade-off between privileged expert distillation and standard RL without privileged information. Our main findings are: (1) The trade-off empirically hinges on the stochasticity of the latent dynamics, as theoretically predicted by contrasting approximate decodability with belief contraction in the perturbed Block MDP; and (2) The optimal latent policy is not always the best latent policy to distill. Our results suggest new guidelines for effectively exploiting privileged information, potentially advancing the efficiency of policy learning across many practical partially observable domains.",

        "summary": "LLM inference often generates a batch of candidates for a prompt and selects one via strategies like majority voting or Best-of- N (BoN). For difficult tasks, this single-shot selection often underperforms. Consequently, evaluations commonly report Pass@$k$: the agent may submit up to $k$ responses, and only the best of them is used when computing regret. Motivated by this, we study inference scaling in the more general Pass@$k$ inference setting, and prove that neither majority voting nor BoN exhibits the desirable scaling with $k$ and the sampling budget $N$. Combining the advantages of majority voting and BoN, we propose a new inference strategy called Best-of-Majority (BoM), with a pivotal step that restricts the candidates to the responses with high frequency in the $N$ samples before selecting the top-$k$ rewards. We prove that when the sampling budget is $N=\\tilde\\Omega(C^*)$, the regret of BoM is $O(\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}+\\sqrt{\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}^2C^*/k})$, where $C^*$ is the coverage coefficient, $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{RM}}$ is the estimation error of the reward model, and $\\epsilon_{\\mathrm{opt}}$ is the estimation error of reward at the optimal response. We further establish a matching lower bound, certifying that our algorithm is minimax optimal. Beyond optimality, BoM has a key advantage: unlike majority voting and BoN, its performance does not degrade when increasing $N$. Experimental results of inference on math problems show BoM outperforming both majority voting and BoN.",

In this work, we explore a critical question: \\textit{does superposition interact with alignment metrics in any undesirable way?} We hypothesize that models which represent the same features in \\textit{different superposition arrangements}, i.e., their neurons have different linear combinations of the features, will interfere with predictive mapping metrics (semi-matching, soft-matching, linear regression), producing lower alignment than expected. We first develop a theory for how the strict permutation metrics are dependent on superposition arrangements. This is tested by training sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to disentangle superposition in toy models, where alignment scores are shown to typically increase when a model's base neurons are replaced with its sparse overcomplete latent codes. We find similar increases for DNN\\(\\rightarrow\\)DNN and DNN\\(\\rightarrow\\)brain linear regression alignment in the visual domain.

We introduce PRISM-Physics, a process-level evaluation framework and benchmark for complex physics reasoning problems. Solutions are represented as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) of formulas, explicitly encoding causal dependencies among intermediate steps to enable fine-grained, interpretable, and theoretically grounded scoring. We prove the optimality of the DAG representation and the corresponding scoring policy. Combining with a fully rule-based method for symbolic formula equivalence matching that we developed, we ensure consistent validation across diverse formulations without heuristic judgments. Results show that our evaluation framework is more aligned with human experts' scoring. Experiments on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent reasoning failures in physics, while step-level scoring offers both diagnostic insight and rich signals for later training.

While the Q-learning Upper Confidence Bound algorithm (QUCB) can discover a proper policy during learning, due to the distribution shifts, this policy can exploit sub-optimal rewards after the shift happens. To address this issue, we propose Density-QUCB (DQUCB), a shift-aware Q-learning~UCB algorithm, which uses a transition density function to detect distribution shifts, then leverages its likelihood to enhance the uncertainty estimation quality of Q-learning~UCB, resulting in a balance between exploration and exploitation. Theoretically, we prove that our oracle DQUCB achieves a better regret guarantee than QUCB.

Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) make it even worse as the model uncertainty from DNN is usually uncalibrated. Therefore, we propose a new AF by estimating calibration errors and query samples with the highest calibration error before leveraging DNN uncertainty. Specifically, we utilize a kernel calibration error estimator under the covariate shift and formally show that AL with this AF eventually leads to a bounded calibration error on the unlabeled pool and unseen test data.

This lets us to study the approximation error of our MoE model class: (i) for one-dimensional inputs, we formulate the test error and its minimizing segmentation and experts; (ii) for multidimensional inputs, we formulate an upper bound for the test error and study its minimization. Moreover, we consider the learning of the expert parameters from a training dataset, given an input-space segmentation, and formulate their statistical learning properties. This leads us to theoretically and empirically show how the tradeoff between approximation and estimation errors in MoE learning depends on the number of experts.",

Our starting point is the observation that seemingly benign errors in a learned verifier can lead to catastrophic failures for standard decoding techniques due to error amplification during the course of generation. We then ask: can this be improved with more sophisticated decoding strategies? We introduce a new process-guided test-time sampling algorithm, VGB, which uses theoretically grounded backtracking to achieve provably better robustness to verifier errors. VGB interprets autoregressive generation as a random walk on a tree of partial generations, with transition probabilities guided by the process verifier and base model; crucially, backtracking occurs probabilistically. This process generalizes the seminal Sinclair-Jerrum random walk (Sinclair & Jerrum, 1989) from the literature on approximate counting and sampling in theoretical computer science, and a conceptual contribution of our work is to highlight parallels with this literature. Empirically, we demonstrate on both synthetic and real language modeling tasks that VGB outperforms baselines on a variety of metrics.",

This study presents a novel deep learning framework centered on a Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) model designed to predict the complex spatiotemporal propagation of train headways across an entire metro line. By directly incorporating planned terminal headways as a critical input alongside historical headway data, the proposed model accurately forecasts future headway dynamics, effectively capturing both their temporal evolution and spatial dependencies across all stations. This capability empowers dispatchers to evaluate the impact of various terminal headway control decisions without resorting to computationally intensive simulations. We introduce a flexible methodology to simulate diverse dispatcher strategies, ranging from maintaining even headways to implementing custom patterns derived from observed terminal departures. In contrast to existing research primarily focused on passenger load predictioning or atypical disruption scenarios, our approach emphasizes proactive operational control. Evaluated on a large-scale dataset from an urban metro line, the proposed ConvLSTM model demonstrates promising headway predictions, offering actionable insights for real-time decision-making.

Current approaches reduce training cost by selecting a subset of layers for retraining, however, they rely on labeled data, at least one full-model backpropagation, or server-side meta-training; limiting their suitability for constrained devices. We introduce AdaBet, a gradient-free layer selection approach to rank important layers by analyzing topological features of their activation spaces through Betti Numbers and using forward passes alone. AdaBet allows selecting layers with high learning capacity, which are important for retraining and adaptation, without requiring labels or gradients. Evaluating AdaBet on sixteen pairs of benchmark models and datasets, shows AdaBet achieves an average gain of 5% more classification accuracy over gradient-based baselines while reducing average peak memory consumption by 40%.",

The ability to measure how features contribute to model output is key for interpreting decisions, reducing dimensionality, and even improving performance by eliminating unhelpful variables. However, graph-structured data introduces complex dependencies that may not be amenable to classical feature importance metrics. Inspired by this challenge, we present a model- and task-agnostic method that determines relevant features during training based on changes in validation performance upon permuting feature values. We theoretically motivate our intervention-based approach by characterizing how GNN performance depends on the relationships between node data and graph structure. Not only do we return feature importance scores once training concludes, we also track how relevance evolves as features are successively dropped. We can therefore monitor if features are eliminated effectively and also evaluate other metrics with this technique. Our empirical results verify the flexibility of our approach to different graph architectures as well as its adaptability to more challenging graph learning settings.",

However, while achieving notable performance in generation quality, these models are limited by their generating speed, often requiring hundreds of iterative steps in the reverse-diffusion process. This computational bottleneck limits their practical utility in large-scale protein discovery, where thousands to millions of candidate structures are needed. To address this challenge, we explore the techniques of score distillation, which has shown great success in reducing the number of sampling steps in the vision domain while maintaining high generation quality. However, a straightforward adaptation of these methods results in unacceptably low designability. Through extensive study, we have identified how to appropriately adapt Score identity Distillation (SiD), a state-of-the-art score distillation strategy, to train few-step protein backbone generators which significantly reduce sampling time, while maintaining comparable performance to their pretrained teacher model. In particular, multistep generation combined with inference time noise modulation is key to the success. We demonstrate that our distilled few-step generators achieve more than a 20-fold improvement in sampling speed, while achieving similar levels of designability, diversity, and novelty as the Proteina teacher model. This reduction in inference cost enables large-scale in silico protein design, thereby bringing diffusion-based models closer to real-world protein engineering applications.",

Our method trains a sequence of GNNs where each network learns to iteratively refine similarity matrices produced by previous networks. During inference, this creates a bootstrap effect: each GNN improves upon partial solutions by incorporating discrete ranking information about node alignment quality from prior iterations. We combine this with a powerful architecture that operates on node pairs rather than individual nodes, capturing global structural patterns essential for alignment that standard message-passing networks cannot represent. Extensive experiments on synthetic benchmarks demonstrate substantial improvements: our chained GNNs achieve over 3x better accuracy than existing methods on challenging instances, and uniquely solve regular graphs where all competing approaches fail. When combined with traditional optimization as post-processing, our method substantially outperforms state-of-the-art solvers on the graph alignment benchmark.",

However, limited attention has been given to the close-enough TSP (CETSP), primarily due to the challenge introduced by its neighborhood-based visitation criterion, wherein a node is considered visited if the agent enters a compact neighborhood around it. In this work, we formulate a Markov decision process (MDP) for CETSP using a discretization scheme and propose a novel unified dual-decoder DRL (UD3RL) framework that separates decision-making into node selection and waypoint determination. Specifically, an adapted encoder is employed for effective feature extraction, followed by a node-decoder and a loc-decoder to handle the two sub-tasks, respectively. A k-nearest neighbors subgraph interaction strategy is further introduced to enhance spatial reasoning during location decoding. Furthermore, we customize the REINFORCE algorithm to train UD3RL as a unified model capable of generalizing across different problem sizes and varying neighborhood radius types (i.e., constant and random radii). Experimental results show that UD3RL outperforms conventional methods in both solution quality and runtime, while exhibiting strong generalization across problem scales, spatial distributions, and radius ranges, as well as robustness to dynamic environments.",

A balanced signed graph has well-defined frequencies that map to a corresponding positive graph via similarity transform of the graph Laplacian matrices. We implement an ideal low-pass filter efficiently on the mapped positive graph via Lanczos approximation, where the optimal cutoff frequency is learned from data.

Unlike conventional IRL approaches that recover a deterministic reward estimate or match only expected returns, our method captures richer structure in expert behavior, particularly in learning the reward distribution, by minimizing first-order stochastic dominance (FSD) violations and thus integrating distortion risk measures (DRMs) into policy learning, enabling the recovery of both reward distributions and distribution-aware policies. This formulation is well-suited for behavior analysis and risk-aware imitation learning. Empirical results on synthetic benchmarks, real-world neurobehavioral data, and MuJoCo control tasks demonstrate that our method recovers expressive reward representations and achieves state-of-the-art imitation performance.",

        "summary": "The development of diagnostic models is gaining traction in the field of psychiatric disorders. Recently, machine learning classifiers based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) have been developed to identify brain biomarkers that differentiate psychiatric disorders from healthy controls. However, conventional machine learning-based diagnostic models often depend on extensive feature engineering, which introduces bias through manual intervention. While deep learning models are expected to operate without manual involvement, their lack of interpretability poses significant challenges in obtaining explainable and reliable brain biomarkers to support diagnostic decisions, ultimately limiting their clinical applicability. In this study, we introduce an end-to-end innovative graph neural network framework named BrainIB++, which applies the information bottleneck (IB) principle to identify the most informative data-driven brain regions as subgraphs during model training for interpretation. We evaluate the performance of our model against nine established brain network classification methods across three multi-cohort schizophrenia datasets. It consistently demonstrates superior diagnostic accuracy and exhibits generalizability to unseen data. Furthermore, the subgraphs identified by our model also correspond with established clinical biomarkers in schizophrenia, particularly emphasizing abnormalities in the visual, sensorimotor, and higher cognition brain functional network. This alignment enhances the model's interpretability and underscores its relevance for real-world diagnostic applications.",

        "summary": "With the growth of global maritime transportation, energy optimization has become crucial for reducing costs and ensuring operational efficiency. Shaft power is the mechanical power transmitted from the engine to the shaft and directly impacts fuel consumption, making its accurate prediction a paramount step in optimizing vessel performance. Power consumption is highly correlated with ship parameters such as speed and shaft rotation per minute, as well as weather and sea conditions. Frequent access to this operational data can improve prediction accuracy. However, obtaining high-quality sensor data is often infeasible and costly, making alternative sources such as noon reports a viable option. In this paper, we propose a transfer learning-based approach for predicting vessels shaft power, where a model is initially trained on high-frequency data from a vessel and then fine-tuned with low-frequency daily noon reports from other vessels. We tested our approach on sister vessels (identical dimensions and configurations), a similar vessel (slightly larger with a different engine), and a different vessel (distinct dimensions and configurations). The experiments showed that the mean absolute percentage error decreased by 10.6 percent for sister vessels, 3.6 percent for a similar vessel, and 5.3 percent for a different vessel, compared to the model trained solely on noon report data.",

We demonstrate that two intrinsic properties of model predictions, namely confidence (which reflects prediction certainty) and dispersity (which captures the diversity of predicted classes), together provide strong and complementary signals for generalization. We systematically benchmark a set of confidence-based, dispersity-based, and hybrid metrics across a wide range of model architectures, datasets, and distribution shift types. Our results show that hybrid metrics consistently outperform single-aspect metrics on both dataset-centric and model-centric evaluation settings. In particular, the nuclear norm of the prediction matrix provides robust and accurate performance across tasks, including real-world datasets, and maintains reliability under moderate class imbalance. These findings offer a practical and generalizable basis for unsupervised model assessment in deployment scenarios.",

To date, continual RL has been explored almost exclusively through the lens of risk-neutral decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize the expected (or mean) long-run performance. In this work, we present the first formal theoretical treatment of continual RL through the lens of risk-aware decision-making, in which the agent aims to optimize a reward-based measure of long-run performance beyond the mean. In particular, we show that the classical theory of risk measures, widely used as a theoretical foundation in non-continual risk-aware RL, is, in its current form, incompatible with the continual setting. Then, building on this insight, we extend risk measure theory into the continual setting by introducing a new class of ergodic risk measures that are compatible with continual learning. Finally, we provide a case study of risk-aware continual learning, along with empirical results, which show the intuitive appeal and theoretical soundness of ergodic risk measures.",

Cell-MNN is fully end-to-end (besides a standard PCA pre-processing) and its ODE representation explicitly learns biologically consistent and interpretable gene interactions. Empirically, we show that Cell-MNN achieves competitive performance on single-cell benchmarks, surpasses state-of-the-art baselines in scaling to larger datasets and joint training across multiple datasets, while also learning interpretable gene interactions that we validate against the TRRUST database of gene interactions.",

We present DMark, the first watermarking framework designed specifically for dLLMs. DMark introduces three complementary strategies to restore watermark detectability: predictive watermarking uses model-predicted tokens when actual context is unavailable; bidirectional watermarking exploits both forward and backward dependencies unique to diffusion decoding; and predictive-bidirectional watermarking combines both approaches to maximize detection strength. Experiments across multiple dLLMs show that DMark achieves 92.0-99.5% detection rates at 1% false positive rate while maintaining text quality, compared to only 49.6-71.2% for naive adaptations of existing methods. DMark also demonstrates robustness against text manipulations, establishing that effective watermarking is feasible for non-autoregressive language models.",

However, it has been challenging to achieve accurate and robust prognostics due to complex battery degradation behaviors with nonlinearity, noise, capacity regeneration, etc. Existing data-driven models capture temporal degradation features but often lack knowledge guidance, which leads to unreliable long-term health prognostics. To overcome these limitations, we propose Karma, a knowledge-aware model with frequency-adaptive learning for battery capacity estimation and remaining useful life prediction. The model first performs signal decomposition to derive battery signals in different frequency bands. A dual-stream deep learning architecture is developed, where one stream captures long-term low-frequency degradation trends and the other models high-frequency short-term dynamics. Karma regulates the prognostics with knowledge, where battery degradation is modeled as a double exponential function based on empirical studies. Our dual-stream model is used to optimize the parameters of the knowledge with particle filters to ensure physically consistent and reliable prognostics and uncertainty quantification. Experimental study demonstrates Karma's superior performance, achieving average error reductions of 50.6% and 32.6% over state-of-the-art algorithms for battery health prediction on two mainstream datasets, respectively.

However, state-of-the-art models, primarily deep neural networks and gradient-boosted ensembles, sacrifice interpretability and fail to adequately address the significant inter-individual variability inherent in lifelog data. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Subject-Adaptive Sparse Linear (SASL) framework, an interpretable modeling approach explicitly designed for personalized health prediction. SASL integrates ordinary least squares regression with subject-specific interactions, systematically distinguishing global from individual-level effects. We employ an iterative backward feature elimination method based on nested $F$-tests to construct a sparse and statistically robust model. Additionally, recognizing that health outcomes often represent discretized versions of continuous processes, we develop a regression-then-thresholding approach specifically designed to maximize macro-averaged F1 scores for ordinal targets. For intrinsically challenging predictions, SASL selectively incorporates outputs from compact LightGBM models through confidence-based gating, enhancing accuracy without compromising interpretability. Evaluations conducted on the CH-2025 dataset -- which comprises roughly 450 daily observations from ten subjects -- demonstrate that the hybrid SASL-LightGBM framework achieves predictive performance comparable to that of sophisticated black-box methods, but with significantly fewer parameters and substantially greater transparency, thus providing clear and actionable insights for clinicians and practitioners.",

This view connects VAR to denoising diffusion and isolates three design choices that help explain its efficiency and fidelity: refining in a learned latent space, casting prediction as discrete classification over code indices, and partitioning the task by spatial frequency. We run controlled experiments to quantify each factor's contribution to fidelity and speed, and we outline how the same framework extends to permutation-invariant graph generation and to probabilistic, ensemble-style medium-range weather forecasting.

Control theory, and more specifically Hankel singular value analysis, provides a potent framework for the measure of energy for each state, as well as the balanced truncation of the original system down to a smaller representation with performance guarantees. Leveraging the eigenvalue stability properties of Hankel matrices, we apply this lens to SSMs during training, where only dimensions of high influence are identified and preserved. Our approach applies to Linear Time-Invariant SSMs such as Linear Recurrent Units, but is also extendable to selective models. Experiments show that in-training reduction significantly accelerates optimization while preserving expressivity, with compressed models retaining task-critical structure lost by models trained directly at smaller dimension.

Any random-order input is \\emph{asymptotically} equivalent to a stochastic i.i.d. one, but, for finite times, it may exhibit significant {\\em non-stationarity}, which can hinder the performance of stochastic learning algorithms. While algorithms for adversarial inputs naturally maintain their regret guarantees in random order, simple no-regret algorithms exist for the stochastic model that fail against random-order instances. In this paper, we propose a general template to adapt stochastic learning algorithms to the random-order model without substantially affecting their regret guarantees. This allows us to recover improved regret bounds for prediction with delays, online learning with constraints, and bandits with switching costs. Finally, we investigate online classification and prove that, in random order, learnability is characterized by the VC dimension rather than the Littlestone dimension, thus providing a further separation from the general adversarial model.",

        "summary": "Conventional supervised learning methods are often vulnerable to spurious correlations, particularly under distribution shifts in test data. To address this issue, several approaches, most notably Group DRO, have been developed. While these methods are highly robust to subpopulation or group shifts, they remain vulnerable to intra-group distributional shifts, which frequently occur in minority groups with limited samples. We propose a hierarchical extension of Group DRO that addresses both inter-group and intra-group uncertainties, providing robustness to distribution shifts at multiple levels. We also introduce new benchmark settings that simulate realistic minority group distribution shifts-an important yet previously underexplored challenge in spurious correlation research. Our method demonstrates strong robustness under these conditions-where existing robust learning methods consistently fail-while also achieving superior performance on standard benchmarks. These results highlight the importance of broadening the ambiguity set to better capture both inter-group and intra-group distributional uncertainties.",

Unlike the one-time cost of training, LLM inference occurs continuously at a global scale and now dominates the AI energy footprint. Yet, most sustainability studies report only coarse, model-level metrics due to the lack of fine-grained measurement methods, treating energy efficiency more as an afterthought than as a primary objective. We present the first fine-grained empirical analysis of inference energy across core components of transformer architecture. We propose a novel methodology, Component-Level Energy Assessment via Repeated sampling (CLEAR), to overcome temporal mismatch between microsecond scale component execution and monitoring of millisecond (ms) scale energy sensors. Using CLEAR, we evaluate 15 models spanning four distinct architecture types and consistently keep component-wise energy variance below 9.5\\% while capturing more than 90\\% of the model's total energy as individual components. Our empirical analysis reveals that Attention blocks consume significantly more energy per floating-point operation (FLOP), indicating that energy consumption is not proportionally aligned with FLOP counts. This shows that FLOPs alone fail to capture the true energy cost at a component level. Our findings establish detailed component-level energy baselines and provide insight as an initial step to build energy-efficient transformer models through component-level optimizations.",

        "summary": "Uncertainty quantification has received considerable interest in recent works in Machine Learning. In particular, Conformal Prediction (CP) gains ground in this field. For the case of time series, Online Conformal Prediction (OCP) becomes an option to address the problem of data distribution shift over time. Indeed, the idea of OCP is to update a threshold of some quantity (whether the miscoverage level or the quantile) based on the distribution observation. To evaluate the performance of OCP methods, two key aspects are typically considered: the coverage validity and the prediction interval width minimization. Recently, new OCP methods have emerged, offering long-run coverage guarantees and producing more informative intervals. However, during the threshold update step, most of these methods focus solely on the validity of the prediction intervals~--~that is, whether the ground truth falls inside or outside the interval~--~without accounting for their relevance. In this paper, we aim to leverage this overlooked aspect. Specifically, we propose enhancing the threshold update step by replacing the binary evaluation (inside/outside) with a broader class of functions that quantify the relevance of the prediction interval using the ground truth. This approach helps prevent abrupt threshold changes, potentially resulting in narrower prediction intervals. Indeed, experimental results on real-world datasets suggest that these functions can produce tighter intervals compared to existing OCP methods while maintaining coverage validity.",

In this work, we establish optimal generalization rates for GD with deep ReLU networks by carefully trading off optimization and generalization errors, achieving only polynomial dependence on depth. Specifically, under the assumption that the data are NTK separable from the margin $\\gamma$, we prove an excess risk rate of $\\widetilde{O}(L^4 (1 + \\gamma L^2) / (n \\gamma^2))$, which aligns with the optimal SVM-type rate $\\widetilde{O}(1 / (n \\gamma^2))$ up to depth-dependent factors.

Experiments often discover a diversity of synaptic plasticity rules, but whether these amount to an approximation to gradient descent is unclear. Here we investigate a previously overlooked possibility: that learning dynamics may include fundamentally non-gradient \"curl\"-like components while still being able to effectively optimize a loss function. Curl terms naturally emerge in networks with inhibitory-excitatory connectivity or Hebbian/anti-Hebbian plasticity, resulting in learning dynamics that cannot be framed as gradient descent on any objective. To investigate the impact of these curl terms, we analyze feedforward networks within an analytically tractable student-teacher framework, systematically introducing non-gradient dynamics through neurons exhibiting rule-flipped plasticity. Small curl terms preserve the stability of the original solution manifold, resulting in learning dynamics similar to gradient descent. Beyond a critical value, strong curl terms destabilize the solution manifold. Depending on the network architecture, this loss of stability can lead to chaotic learning dynamics that destroy performance. In other cases, the curl terms can counterintuitively speed learning compared to gradient descent by allowing the weight dynamics to escape saddles by temporarily ascending the loss. Our results identify specific architectures capable of supporting robust learning via diverse learning rules, providing an important counterpoint to normative theories of gradient-based learning in neural networks.",

Therefore, we present TokenFlow, a novel LLM serving system with enhanced text streaming performance via preemptive request scheduling and proactive key-value (KV) cache management. TokenFlow dynamically prioritizes requests based on real-time token buffer occupancy and token consumption rate, while actively transferring KV cache between GPU and CPU memory in the background and overlapping I/O with computation to minimize request preemption overhead. Extensive experiments on Llama3-8B and Qwen2.5-32B across multiple GPUs (RTX 4090, A6000, H200) demonstrate that TokenFlow achieves up to 82.5% higher effective throughput (accounting for actual user consumption) while reducing P99 TTFT by up to 80.2%, without degrading overall token throughput.",

        "summary": "Due to its powerful capability of self-supervised representation learning and clustering, contrastive attributed graph clustering (CAGC) has achieved great success, which mainly depends on effective data augmentation and contrastive objective setting. However, most CAGC methods utilize edges as auxiliary information to obtain node-level embedding representation and only focus on node-level embedding augmentation. This approach overlooks edge-level embedding augmentation and the interactions between node-level and edge-level embedding augmentations across various granularity. Moreover, they often treat all contrastive sample pairs equally, neglecting the significant differences between hard and easy positive-negative sample pairs, which ultimately limits their discriminative capability. To tackle these issues, a novel robust attributed graph clustering (RAGC), incorporating hybrid-collaborative augmentation (HCA) and contrastive sample adaptive-differential awareness (CSADA), is proposed. First, node-level and edge-level embedding representations and augmentations are simultaneously executed to establish a more comprehensive similarity measurement criterion for subsequent contrastive learning. In turn, the discriminative similarity further consciously guides edge augmentation. Second, by leveraging pseudo-label information with high confidence, a CSADA strategy is elaborately designed, which adaptively identifies all contrastive sample pairs and differentially treats them by an innovative weight modulation function. The HCA and CSADA modules mutually reinforce each other in a beneficent cycle, thereby enhancing discriminability in representation learning. Comprehensive graph clustering evaluations over six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RAGC against several state-of-the-art CAGC methods.",

        "summary": "Gradient descent has proven to be a powerful and effective technique for optimization in numerous machine learning applications. Recent advances in computational neuroscience have shown that learning in standard gradient descent optimization formulation is not consistent with learning in biological systems. This has opened up interesting avenues for building biologically inspired learning techniques. One such approach is inspired by Dale's law, which states that inhibitory and excitatory synapses do not swap roles during the course of learning. The resulting exponential gradient descent optimization scheme leads to log-normally distributed synaptic weights. Interestingly, the density that satisfies the Fokker-Planck equation corresponding to the stochastic differential equation (SDE) with geometric Brownian motion (GBM) is the log-normal density. Leveraging this connection, we start with the SDE governing geometric Brownian motion, and show that discretizing the corresponding reverse-time SDE yields a multiplicative update rule, which surprisingly, coincides with the sampling equivalent of the exponential gradient descent update founded on Dale's law. Furthermore, we propose a new formalism for multiplicative denoising score-matching, subsuming the loss function proposed by Hyvaerinen for non-negative data. Indeed, log-normally distributed data is positive and the proposed score-matching formalism turns out to be a natural fit. This allows for training of score-based models for image data and results in a novel multiplicative update scheme for sample generation starting from a log-normal density. Experimental results on MNIST, Fashion MNIST, and Kuzushiji datasets demonstrate generative capability of the new scheme. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a biologically inspired generative model employing multiplicative updates, founded on geometric Brownian motion.",

Despite the exponential growth of community interests, researchers are sometimes confused about the direction of their efforts due to minor improvements on standard benchmarks. In this paper, we notice that, unlike image recognition, whose well-acknowledged and realizable goal is 100% accuracy, time series forecasting inherently faces a non-zero error lower bound due to its partially observable and uncertain nature. To pinpoint the research objective and release researchers from saturated tasks, this paper focuses on a fundamental question: how to estimate the performance upper bound of deep time series forecasting? Going beyond classical series-wise predictability metrics, e.g., ADF test, we realize that the forecasting performance is highly related to window-wise properties because of the sequence-to-sequence forecasting paradigm of deep time series models. Based on rigorous statistical tests of over 2,800 newly trained deep forecasters, we discover a significant exponential relationship between the minimum forecasting error of deep models and the complexity of window-wise series patterns, which is termed the accuracy law. The proposed accuracy law successfully guides us to identify saturated tasks from widely used benchmarks and derives an effective training strategy for large time series models, offering valuable insights for future research.",

While pre-trained diffusion models effectively capture the training data distribution, it is often desirable to shape these distributions using reward functions to align with downstream applications. Policy gradient methods, such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), are widely used in the context of autoregressive generation. However, the marginal likelihoods required for such methods are intractable for diffusion models, leading to alternative proposals and relaxations. In this context, we unify variants of Rejection sAmpling based Fine-Tuning (RAFT) as GRAFT, and show that this implicitly performs PPO with reshaped rewards. We then introduce P-GRAFT to shape distributions at intermediate noise levels and demonstrate empirically that this can lead to more effective fine-tuning. We mathematically explain this via a bias-variance tradeoff. Motivated by this, we propose inverse noise correction to improve flow models without leveraging explicit rewards. We empirically evaluate our methods on text-to-image(T2I) generation, layout generation, molecule generation and unconditional image generation.

        "summary": "Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak, a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution. EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for real-world optimization problems.",

Despite their successes, a deeper understanding of their learning mechanisms remains underexplored. In this work, we classify neural operators into two types: (1) Spatial domain models that learn on grids and (2) Functional domain models that learn with function bases. We present several viewpoints based on this classification and focus on learning data-driven dynamics adhering to physical principles. Specifically, we provide a way to explain the prediction-making process of neural operators and show that neural operator can learn hidden physical patterns from data. However, this explanation method is limited to specific situations, highlighting the urgent need for generalizable explanation methods. Next, we show that a simple dual-space multi-scale model can achieve SOTA performance and we believe that dual-space multi-spatio-scale models hold significant potential to learn complex physics and require further investigation. Lastly, we discuss the critical need for principled frameworks to incorporate known physics into neural operators, enabling better generalization and uncovering more hidden physical phenomena.",

We argue that the fundamental solution lies in developing low-precision floating-point formats, which inherently provide numerical stability, memory savings, and hardware efficiency without dequantization overhead. In this paper, we present a theoretical and empirical study of an exponent concentration phenomenon in GenAI weights: exponents consistently exhibit low entropy across architectures and modalities. We show that this arises naturally from $\\alpha$-stable distributions induced by stochastic gradient descent, and we prove tight bounds on the entropy of exponents. Our analysis establishes a theoretical compression limit near FP4.67, which motivates the design of a practical FP8 format. Building on these insights, we propose Exponent-Concentrated FP8 (ECF8), a lossless compression framework with entropy-aware encoding and GPU-optimized decoding. Experiments on LLMs and DiTs up to 671B parameters demonstrate up to 26.9% memory savings and 177.1% throughput acceleration, with perfectly lossless computations, i.e., no deviation in model outputs. Our results establish exponent concentration as a statistical law of trained models and open a principled path for lossless low-precision floating-point design in the FP8 era.",

This result reveals a qualitative difference between small and large learning rates $\\eta$. With a learning rate below a topological critical point $\\eta^*$, the training is constrained to preserve all topological structure of the neurons. In contrast, above $\\eta^*$, the learning process allows for topological simplification, making the neuron manifold progressively coarser and thereby reducing the model's expressivity. Viewed in combination with the recent discovery of the edge of stability phenomenon, the learning dynamics of neuron networks under gradient descent can be divided into two phases: first they undergo smooth optimization under topological constraints, and then enter a second phase where they learn through drastic topological simplifications. A key feature of our theory is that it is independent of specific architectures or loss functions, enabling the universal application of topological methods to the study of deep learning.",

        "summary": "As students increasingly adopt large language models (LLMs) as learning aids, it is crucial to build models that are adept at handling the nuances of tutoring: they need to identify the core needs of students, be adaptive, provide personalized guidance, and be accurate. To this end, we introduce TutorBench, a dataset and evaluation benchmark designed to rigorously evaluate the core tutoring skills of LLMs. The dataset comprises 1,490 samples curated by human experts, focused on high-school and AP-level curricula. The samples are drawn from three common tutoring tasks: (i) generating adaptive explanations tailored to a student's confusion, (ii) providing actionable feedback on a student's work, and (iii) promoting active learning through effective hint generation. To account for the inherent complexity of tutoring, samples are accompanied by sample-specific rubrics which are used to judge model responses during evaluation. TutorBench uses a reliable and fine-grained automatic evaluation method that uses an LLM-judge and the sample-specific rubrics. We evaluate 16 frontier LLMs on TutorBench and present a detailed analysis of their performance and behavior. Our results show that none of the frontier LLMs achieve a score of greater than $56\\%$, showing a large room for improvement. We find that LLMs fall short in exhibiting the full range of tutoring skills needed to guide, diagnose, and support students effectively, with all the frontier models achieving less than a $60\\%$ pass rate on rubric criteria related to these skills. We also find that different model families exhibit varied strengths and limitations: the Claude models outperform others in supporting active learning, while they lag behind in the other two use cases. By releasing TutorBench, we provide a comprehensive and unsaturated benchmark to guide the development of the next-generation of AI tutors.",

This method involves analysing the coupled vehicle-bridge response, recorded by an instrumented inspection vehicle, to assess structural integrity and detect damage. However, the vehicles mechanical and dynamic properties significantly influence detection performance, limiting the effectiveness of the approach. This study presents a framework for optimising the inspection vehicle to enhance damage sensitivity. An unsupervised deep learning methodbased on adversarial autoencoders (AAE)is used to reconstruct the frequency- domain representation of acceleration responses. The mass and stiffness of the tyre suspension system of a two-axle vehicle are optimised by minimising the Wasserstein distance between damage index distributions for healthy and damaged bridge states. A Kriging meta-model is employed to approximate this objective function efficiently and identify optimal vehicle configurations in both dimensional and non-dimensional parameter spaces. Results show that vehicles with frequency ratios between 0.3 and 0.7 relative to the bridges' first natural frequency are most effective, while those near resonance perform poorly. Lighter vehicles require lower natural frequencies for optimal detection. This is the first study to rigorously optimise the sensing platform for drive-by sensing and to propose a purpose-built inspection vehicle.",

In this work, we aim to obtain the best out of both worlds by introducing a novel update rule that computes the target using the MINimum estimate between the Target and Online network, giving rise to our method, MINTO. Through this simple, yet effective modification, we show that MINTO enables faster and stable value function learning, by mitigating the potential overestimation bias of using the online network for bootstrapping. Notably, MINTO can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of value-based and actor-critic algorithms with a negligible cost. We evaluate MINTO extensively across diverse benchmarks, spanning online and offline RL, as well as discrete and continuous action spaces.

Research on GNN expressivity has produced many expressive architectures, leading to architecture hierarchies with models of increasing expressive power. Separately, derivatives of GNNs with respect to node features have been widely studied in the context of the oversquashing and over-smoothing phenomena, GNN explainability, and more. To date, these derivatives remain unexplored as a means to enhance GNN expressivity. In this paper, we show that these derivatives provide a natural way to enhance the expressivity of GNNs. We introduce High-Order Derivative GNN (HOD-GNN), a novel method that enhances the expressivity of Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) by leveraging high-order node derivatives of the base model. These derivatives generate expressive structure-aware node embeddings processed by a second GNN in an end-to-end trainable architecture. Theoretically, we show that the resulting architecture family's expressive power aligns with the WL hierarchy. We also draw deep connections between HOD-GNN, Subgraph GNNs, and popular structural encoding schemes. For computational efficiency, we develop a message-passing algorithm for computing high-order derivatives of MPNNs that exploits graph sparsity and parallelism.

        "summary": "Artificial neural network models have emerged as promising mechanistic models of the brain. However, there is little consensus on the correct method for comparing model activations to brain responses. Drawing on recent work in philosophy of neuroscience, we propose a comparison methodology based on the Inter-Animal Transform Class (IATC) - the strictest set of functions needed to accurately map neural responses between subjects in an animal population. Using the IATC, we can map bidirectionally between a candidate model's responses and brain data, assessing how well the model can masquerade as a typical subject using the same kinds of transforms needed to map across real subjects. We identify the IATC in three settings: a simulated population of neural network models, a population of mouse subjects, and a population of human subjects. We find that the IATC resolves detailed aspects of the neural mechanism, such as the non-linear activation function. Most importantly, we find that the IATC enables accurate predictions of neural activity while also achieving high specificity in mechanism identification, evidenced by its ability to separate response patterns from different brain areas while strongly aligning same-brain-area responses between subjects. In other words, the IATC is a proof-by-existence that there is no inherent tradeoff between the neural engineering goal of high model-brain predictivity and the neuroscientific goal of identifying mechanistically accurate brain models. Using IATC-guided transforms, we obtain new evidence in favor of topographical deep neural networks (TDANNs) as models of the visual system. Overall, the IATC enables principled model-brain comparisons, contextualizing previous findings about the predictive success of deep learning models of the brain, while improving upon previous approaches to model-brain comparison.",

We then define geodesic flows between embeddings and match distributions along these flows to generate output graphs. Our method yields several advantages: (i) captures geometric structure beyond eigenvalues, (ii) supports flexible generation of diverse graphs, and (iii) scales efficiently. Empirically, SFMG matches the performance of state-of-the-art approaches on graphlet, degree, and spectral metrics across diverse benchmarks. In particular, it achieves up to 30$\\times$ speedup over diffusion-based models, offering a substantial advantage in scalability and training efficiency.

        "summary": "Analog in-memory computing (AIMC) accelerators enable efficient deep neural network computation directly within memory using resistive crossbar arrays, where model parameters are represented by the conductance states of memristive devices. However, effective in-memory training typically requires at least 8-bit conductance states to match digital baselines. Realizing such fine-grained states is costly and often requires complex noise mitigation techniques that increase circuit complexity and energy consumption. In practice, many promising memristive devices such as ReRAM offer only about 4-bit resolution due to fabrication constraints, and this limited update precision substantially degrades training accuracy. To enable on-chip training with these limited-state devices, this paper proposes a \\emph{residual learning} framework that sequentially learns on multiple crossbar tiles to compensate the residual errors from low-precision weight updates. Our theoretical analysis shows that the optimality gap shrinks with the number of tiles and achieves a linear convergence rate. Experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art in-memory analog training strategies under limited-state settings, while incurring only moderate hardware overhead as confirmed by our cost analysis.",

DRL has the potential to learn from large datasets to quickly control or optimize the outputs of many-parameter systems, but its performance degrades catastrophically when the system model changes rapidly over time. Bounded ES can handle time-varying systems with unknown control directions, but its convergence speed slows down as the number of tuned parameters increases and, like all local adaptive methods, it can get stuck in local minima. We demonstrate that together, DRL and bounded ES result in a hybrid controller whose performance exceeds the sum of its parts with DRL taking advantage of historical data to learn how to quickly control a many-parameter system to a desired setpoint while bounded ES ensures its robustness to time variations. We present a numerical study of a general time-varying system and a combined ES-DRL controller for automatic tuning of the Low Energy Beam Transport section at the Los Alamos Neutron Science Center linear particle accelerator.",

We address this representation problem with Action-Controllable Factorization (ACF), a contrastive learning approach that uncovers independently controllable latent variables -- state components each action can influence separately. ACF leverages sparsity: actions typically affect only a subset of variables, while the rest evolve under the environment's dynamics, yielding informative data for contrastive training. ACF recovers the ground truth controllable factors directly from pixel observations on three benchmarks with known factored structure -- Taxi, FourRooms, and MiniGrid-DoorKey -- consistently outperforming baseline disentanglement algorithms.",

An open question is how to select the best models for the ensemble without access to ground truth labels. In this study, we investigate an uncertainty-guided strategy for model selection. We demonstrate on an siRNA knockdown efficacy task that a TabPFN model using simple sequence-based features can surpass specialized state-of-the-art predictors. We also show that the model's predicted inter-quantile range (IQR), a measure of its uncertainty, has a negative correlation with true prediction error. By selecting and averaging an ensemble of models with the lowest mean IQR, we achieve superior performance compared to naive ensembling or using a single model trained on all available data.

        "summary": "Post-training quantization (PTQ) has recently emerged as an effective tool for reducing the computational complexity and memory usage of a neural network by representing its weights and activations with lower precision. While this paradigm has shown great success in lowering compute and storage costs, there is the potential for drastic performance reduction depending upon the distribution of inputs experienced in inference. When considering possible deployment in safety-critical environments, it is important to investigate the extent of potential performance reduction, and what characteristics of input distributions may give rise to this reduction. In this work, we explore the idea of extreme failure stemming from dynamic PTQ and formulate a knowledge distillation and reinforcement learning task to learn a network and bit-width policy pair such that catastrophic failure under quantization is analyzed in terms of worst case potential. Our results confirm the existence of this \"detrimental\" network-policy pair, with several instances demonstrating performance reductions in the range of 10-65% in accuracy, compared to their \"robust\" counterparts encountering a <2% decrease. From systematic experimentation and analyses, we also provide an initial exploration into points at highest vulnerability. While our results represent an initial step toward understanding failure cases introduced by PTQ, our findings ultimately emphasize the need for caution in real-world deployment scenarios. We hope this work encourages more rigorous examinations of robustness and a greater emphasis on safety considerations for future works within the broader field of deep learning.",

We introduce RainSeer, a structure-aware reconstruction framework that reinterprets radar reflectivity as a physically grounded structural prior-capturing when, where, and how rain develops. This shift, however, introduces two fundamental challenges: (i) translating high-resolution volumetric radar fields into sparse point-wise rainfall observations, and (ii) bridging the physical disconnect between aloft hydro-meteors and ground-level precipitation. RainSeer addresses these through a physics-informed two-stage architecture: a Structure-to-Point Mapper performs spatial alignment by projecting mesoscale radar structures into localized ground-level rainfall, through a bidirectional mapping, and a Geo-Aware Rain Decoder captures the semantic transformation of hydro-meteors through descent, melting, and evaporation via a causal spatiotemporal attention mechanism. We evaluate RainSeer on two public datasets-RAIN-F (Korea, 2017-2019) and MeteoNet (France, 2016-2018)-and observe consistent improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, reducing MAE by over 13.31% and significantly enhancing structural fidelity in reconstructed rainfall fields.",

        "summary": "LLMs have emerged as powerful tools for interpreting multimodal data. In medicine, they hold particular promise for synthesizing large volumes of clinical information into actionable insights and digital health applications. Yet, a major limitation remains their inability to handle time series. To overcome this gap, we present OpenTSLM, a family of Time Series Language Models (TSLMs) created by integrating time series as a native modality to pretrained LLMs, enabling reasoning over multiple time series of any length. We investigate two architectures for OpenTSLM. The first, OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt, models time series implicitly by concatenating learnable time series tokens with text tokens via soft prompting. Although parameter-efficient, we hypothesize that explicit time series modeling scales better and outperforms implicit approaches. We thus introduce OpenTSLM-Flamingo, which integrates time series with text via cross-attention. We benchmark both variants against baselines that treat time series as text tokens or plots, across a suite of text-time-series Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning tasks. We introduce three datasets: HAR-CoT, Sleep-CoT, and ECG-QA-CoT. Across all, OpenTSLM models outperform baselines, reaching 69.9 F1 in sleep staging and 65.4 in HAR, compared to 9.05 and 52.2 for finetuned text-only models. Notably, even 1B-parameter OpenTSLM models surpass GPT-4o (15.47 and 2.95). OpenTSLM-Flamingo matches OpenTSLM-SoftPrompt in performance and outperforms on longer sequences, while maintaining stable memory requirements. By contrast, SoftPrompt grows exponentially in memory with sequence length, requiring around 110 GB compared to 40 GB VRAM when training on ECG-QA with LLaMA-3B. Expert reviews by clinicians find strong reasoning capabilities exhibited by OpenTSLMs on ECG-QA. To facilitate further research, we provide all code, datasets, and models open-source.",

Unlike existing methods that rely on feature filtering or smoothing, which can lead to information loss, we propose to \"combat noise with noise\" by leveraging stochastic resonance to enhance robustness while minimizing information loss. Our approach introduces small translational perturbations to the input image, aligns the transformed feature embeddings, and aggregates them before mapping back to the original reference image. This can be expressed in a closed-form formula, which can be deployed on diverse existing network architectures without introducing additional network modules or fine-tuning for specific attack types. The resulting method is entirely training-free, architecture-agnostic, and attack-agnostic. Empirical results show state-of-the-art robustness on image classification and, for the first time, establish a generic test-time defense for dense prediction tasks, including stereo matching and optical flow, highlighting the method's versatility and practicality. Specifically, relative to clean (unperturbed) performance, our method recovers up to 68.1% of the accuracy loss on image classification, 71.9% on stereo matching, and 29.2% on optical flow under various types of adversarial attacks.",

Our approach utilizes a mixed integer linear programming implementation of the rolling intrinsic algorithm for intraday decisions and state of charge recovery, alongside a learned classifier strategy (LCS) that determines optimal capacity allocation between markets. A comprehensive out-of-sample backtest over more than one year of historical German market data validates our approach: The LCS increases overall profits by over 4% compared to the best-performing static strategy and by more than 3% over a naive dynamic benchmark.

When both the gradient and the Hessian are Lipschitz continuous, instantiating this framework with two different online learners achieves a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1.75}\\log(1/\\varepsilon))$ in the deterministic case and a complexity of $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-3.5})$ in the stochastic case. However, this approach suffers from several limitations: (i) the deterministic method relies on a complex double-loop scheme that solves a fixed-point equation to construct hint vectors for an optimistic online learner, introducing an extra logarithmic factor; (ii) the stochastic method assumes a bounded second-order moment of the stochastic gradient, which is stronger than standard variance bounds; and (iii) different online learning algorithms are used in the two settings. In this paper, we address these issues by introducing an online optimistic gradient method based on a novel \\textit{doubly optimistic hint function}. Specifically, we use the gradient at an extrapolated point as the hint, motivated by two optimistic assumptions: that the difference between the hint and the target gradient remains near constant, and that consecutive update directions change slowly due to smoothness. Our method eliminates the need for a double loop and removes the logarithmic factor. Furthermore, by simply replacing full gradients with stochastic gradients and under the standard assumption that their variance is bounded by $\\sigma^2$, we obtain a unified algorithm with complexity $\\mathcal{O}(\\varepsilon^{-1.75} + \\sigma^2 \\varepsilon^{-3.5})$, smoothly interpolating between the best-known deterministic rate and the optimal stochastic rate.",

This approach captures the biological variability and uncertainty inherent in neuronal firing. We systematically compare the relative error of AP onset predictions between the classical LIF and QI-LIF models using synthetic data from hippocampal and sensory neurons subjected to varying stimulus amplitudes. Our results demonstrate that the QI-LIF model significantly reduces prediction error, particularly for high-intensity stimuli, aligning closely with observed biological responses.

While these problems have been extensively studied under multiplicative perturbation resilience in low-dimensional Euclidean spaces (e.g., (Friggstad et al., 2019; Cohen-Addad and Schwiegelshohn, 2017)), we adopt a more general notion of stability, termed ``almost stable'', which is closer to the notion of $(\\alpha, \\varepsilon)$-perturbation resilience introduced by Balcan and Liang (2016). Additionally, we extend our results to $\\mathrm{k-M\\small{EANS}}$/$\\mathrm{k-M\\small{EDIAN}}$ with penalties, where each data point is either assigned to a cluster centre or incurs a penalty. We show that certain special cases of almost stable $\\mathrm{k-M\\small{EANS}}$/$\\mathrm{k-M\\small{EDIAN}}$ (with penalties) are solvable in polynomial time. To complement this, we also examine the hardness of almost stable instances and $(1 + \\frac{1}{poly(n)})$-stable instances of $\\mathrm{k-M\\small{EANS}}$/$\\mathrm{k-M\\small{EDIAN}}$ (with penalties), proving super-polynomial lower bounds on the runtime of any exact algorithm under the widely believed Exponential Time Hypothesis (ETH).",

Through controlled experiments, we identify two key factors: (i) whether the training objective operates on a discrete or continuous distribution, and (ii) to what extent conditioning provides information about the constituent concepts during training. Building on these insights, we show that relaxing the MaskGIT discrete loss with an auxiliary continuous JEPA-based objective can improve compositional performance in discrete models like MaskGIT.",

We introduce FR-LUX (Friction-aware, Regime-conditioned Learning under eXecution costs), a reinforcement learning framework that learns after-cost trading policies and remains robust across volatility-liquidity regimes. FR-LUX integrates three ingredients: (i) a microstructure-consistent execution model combining proportional and impact costs, directly embedded in the reward; (ii) a trade-space trust region that constrains changes in inventory flow rather than logits, yielding stable low-turnover updates; and (iii) explicit regime conditioning so the policy specializes to LL/LH/HL/HH states without fragmenting the data. On a 4 x 5 grid of regimes and cost levels with multiple random seeds, FR-LUX achieves the top average Sharpe ratio with narrow bootstrap confidence intervals, maintains a flatter cost-performance slope than strong baselines, and attains superior risk-return efficiency for a given turnover budget. Pairwise scenario-level improvements are strictly positive and remain statistically significant after multiple-testing corrections. We provide formal guarantees on optimality under convex frictions, monotonic improvement under a KL trust region, long-run turnover bounds and induced inaction bands due to proportional costs, positive value advantage for regime-conditioned policies, and robustness to cost misspecification. The methodology is implementable: costs are calibrated from standard liquidity proxies, scenario-level inference avoids pseudo-replication, and all figures and tables are reproducible from released artifacts.",

        "summary": "Deep learning (DL) has demonstrated promise for accelerating and enhancing the accuracy of flow physics simulations, but progress is constrained by the scarcity of high-fidelity training data, which is costly to generate and inherently limited to a small set of flow conditions. Consequently, closures trained in the conventional offline paradigm tend to overfit and fail to generalise to new regimes. We introduce an online optimisation framework for DL-based Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes (RANS) closures which seeks to address the challenge of limited high-fidelity datasets. Training data is dynamically generated by embedding a direct numerical simulation (DNS) within a subdomain of the RANS domain. The RANS solution supplies boundary conditions to the DNS, while the DNS provides mean velocity and turbulence statistics that are used to update a DL closure model during the simulation. This feedback loop enables the closure to adapt to the embedded DNS target flow, avoiding reliance on precomputed datasets and improving out-of-distribution performance. The approach is demonstrated for the stochastically forced Burgers equation and for turbulent channel flow at $Re_\\tau=180$, $270$, $395$ and $590$ with varying embedded domain lengths $1\\leq L_0/L\\leq 8$. Online-optimised RANS models significantly outperform both offline-trained and literature-calibrated closures, with accurate training achieved using modest DNS subdomains. Performance degrades primarily when boundary-condition contamination dominates or when domains are too short to capture low-wavenumber modes. This framework provides a scalable route to physics-informed machine learning closures, enabling data-adaptive reduced-order models that generalise across flow regimes without requiring large precomputed training datasets.",

We apply sparse autoencoders to decompose LLM representations, identifying directions that correspond to code correctness. We select predictor directions using t-statistics and steering directions through separation scores from base model representations, then analyze their mechanistic properties through steering, attention analysis, and weight orthogonalization. We find that code correctness directions in LLMs reliably predict incorrect code, while correction capabilities, though statistically significant, involve tradeoffs between fixing errors and preserving correct code. Mechanistically, successful code generation depends on attending to test cases rather than problem descriptions. Moreover, directions identified in base models retain their effectiveness after instruction-tuning, suggesting code correctness mechanisms learned during pre-training are repurposed during fine-tuning. Our mechanistic insights suggest three practical applications: prompting strategies should prioritize test examples over elaborate problem descriptions, predictor directions can serve as error alarms for developer review, and these same predictors can guide selective steering, intervening only when errors are anticipated to prevent the code corruption from constant steering.",

However, previous audio hiding methods often result in unsatisfactory quality when recovering secret audio, due to their inherent limitations in the modeling of time-frequency relationships. In this paper, we explore these limitations and introduce a new DNN-based approach. We use a flow-based invertible neural network to establish a direct link between stego audio, cover audio, and secret audio, enhancing the reversibility of embedding and extracting messages. To address common issues from time-frequency transformations that degrade secret audio quality during recovery, we implement a time-frequency loss on the time-domain signal. This approach not only retains the benefits of time-frequency constraints but also enhances the reversibility of message recovery, which is vital for practical applications. We also add an encryption technique to protect the hidden data from unauthorized access. Experimental results on the VCTK and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches in terms of subjective and objective metrics and exhibits robustness to various types of noise, suggesting its utility in targeted secure communication scenarios.",

This paper introduces ELMF4EggQ, an ensemble learning framework that employs multimodal feature fusion to classify egg grade and freshness using only external attributes - image, shape, and weight. A novel, publicly available dataset of 186 brown-shelled eggs was constructed, with egg grade and freshness levels determined through laboratory-based expert assessments involving internal quality measurements, such as yolk index and Haugh unit. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply machine learning methods for internal egg quality assessment using only external, non-invasive features, and the first to release a corresponding labeled dataset. The proposed framework integrates deep features extracted from external egg images with structural characteristics such as egg shape and weight, enabling a comprehensive representation of each egg. Image feature extraction is performed using top-performing pre-trained CNN models (ResNet152, DenseNet169, and ResNet152V2), followed by PCA-based dimensionality reduction, SMOTE augmentation, and classification using multiple machine learning algorithms. An ensemble voting mechanism combines predictions from the best-performing classifiers to enhance overall accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that the multimodal approach significantly outperforms image-only and tabular (shape and weight) only baselines, with the multimodal ensemble approach achieving 86.57% accuracy in grade classification and 70.83% in freshness prediction.

Land use change perceptions included deforestation, coastal degradation, habitat protection, renewable energy facilities, wetlands, and others. Additional concerns such as invasive species, water or energy scarcity, infrastructure problems, and austerity were also considered. Climate and land use change impact perceptions were analysed with machine learning to quantify their influence. The predominant climatic characteristic is temperature, and the predominant land use characteristic is deforestation. Water-related problems are top priorities for stakeholders. Energy-related problems, including energy deficiency and issues with wind and solar facilities, rank high as combined climate and land use risks. Stakeholders generally perceive climate change impacts on ecosystem services as negative, with natural habitat destruction and biodiversity loss identified as top issues. Land use change impacts are also negative but more complex, with more explanatory variables. Stakeholders share common perceptions on biodiversity impacts despite geographic disparity, but they differentiate between climate and land use impacts.

        "summary": "Medical object detection suffers when a single detector is trained on mixed medical modalities (e.g., CXR, CT, MRI) due to heterogeneous statistics and disjoint representation spaces. To address this challenge, we turn to representation alignment, an approach that has proven effective for bringing features from different sources into a shared space. Specifically, we target the representations of DETR-style object queries and propose a simple, detector-agnostic framework to align them with modality context. First, we define modality tokens: compact, text-derived embeddings encoding imaging modality that are lightweight and require no extra annotations. We integrate the modality tokens into the detection process via Multimodality Context Attention (MoCA), mixing object-query representations via self-attention to propagate modality context within the query set. This preserves DETR-style architectures and adds negligible latency while injecting modality cues into object queries. We further introduce QueryREPA, a short pretraining stage that aligns query representations to their modality tokens using a task-specific contrastive objective with modality-balanced batches. Together, MoCA and QueryREPA produce modality-aware, class-faithful queries that transfer effectively to downstream training. Across diverse modalities trained altogether, the proposed approach consistently improves AP with minimal overhead and no architectural modifications, offering a practical path toward robust multimodality medical object detection.

        "summary": "Accurate brain tumor classification is critical for intra-operative decision making in neuro-oncological surgery. However, existing approaches are restricted to a fixed set of predefined classes and are therefore unable to capture patterns of tumor types not available during training. Unsupervised learning can extract general-purpose features, but it lacks the ability to incorporate prior knowledge from labelled data, and semi-supervised methods often assume that all potential classes are represented in the labelled data. Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to bridge this gap by categorizing both known and unknown classes within unlabelled data. To reflect the hierarchical structure of brain tumor taxonomies, in this work, we introduce Hierarchical Generalized Category Discovery for Brain Tumor Classification (HGCD-BT), a novel approach that integrates hierarchical clustering with contrastive learning. Our method extends contrastive learning based GCD by incorporating a novel semi-supervised hierarchical clustering loss. We evaluate HGCD-BT on OpenSRH, a dataset of stimulated Raman histology brain tumor images, achieving a +28% improvement in accuracy over state-of-the-art GCD methods for patch-level classification, particularly in identifying previously unseen tumor categories. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of HGCD-BT on slide-level classification of hematoxylin and eosin stained whole-slide images from the Digital Brain Tumor Atlas, confirming its utility across imaging modalities.",

        "summary": "In this work, we explore how Neural Jump ODEs (NJODEs) can be used as generative models for Itô processes. Given (discrete observations of) samples of a fixed underlying Itô process, the NJODE framework can be used to approximate the drift and diffusion coefficients of the process. Under standard regularity assumptions on the Itô processes, we prove that, in the limit, we recover the true parameters with our approximation. Hence, using these learned coefficients to sample from the corresponding Itô process generates, in the limit, samples with the same law as the true underlying process. Compared to other generative machine learning models, our approach has the advantage that it does not need adversarial training and can be trained solely as a predictive model on the observed samples without the need to generate any samples during training to empirically approximate the distribution. Moreover, the NJODE framework naturally deals with irregularly sampled data with missing values as well as with path-dependent dynamics, allowing to apply this approach in real-world settings. In particular, in the case of path-dependent coefficients of the Itô processes, the NJODE learns their optimal approximation given the past observations and therefore allows generating new paths conditionally on discrete, irregular, and incomplete past observations in an optimal way.",

        "summary": "While visuomotor policy has made advancements in recent years, contact-rich tasks still remain a challenge. Robotic manipulation tasks that require continuous contact demand explicit handling of compliance and force. However, most visuomotor policies ignore compliance, overlooking the importance of physical interaction with the real world, often leading to excessive contact forces or fragile behavior under uncertainty. Introducing force information into vision-based imitation learning could help improve awareness of contacts, but could also require a lot of data to perform well. One remedy for data scarcity is to generate data in simulation, yet computationally taxing processes are required to generate data good enough not to suffer from the Sim2Real gap. In this work, we introduce a framework for generating force-informed data in simulation, instantiated by a single human demonstration, and show how coupling with a compliant policy improves the performance of a visuomotor policy learned from synthetic data. We validate our approach on real-robot tasks, including non-prehensile block flipping and a bi-manual object moving, where the learned policy exhibits reliable contact maintenance and adaptation to novel conditions.

        "summary": "Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the main algorithm behind a large body of work in machine learning. In many cases, constraints are enforced via projections, leading to projected stochastic gradient algorithms. In recent years, a large body of work has examined the convergence properties of projected SGD for non-convex losses in asymptotic and non-asymptotic settings. Strong quantitative guarantees are available for convergence measured via Moreau envelopes. However, these results cannot be compared directly with work on unconstrained SGD, since the Moreau envelope construction changes the gradient. Other common measures based on gradient mappings have the limitation that convergence can only be guaranteed if variance reduction methods, such as mini-batching, are employed. This paper presents an analysis of projected SGD for non-convex losses over compact convex sets. Convergence is measured via the distance of the gradient to the Goldstein subdifferential generated by the constraints. Our proposed convergence criterion directly reduces to commonly used criteria in the unconstrained case, and we obtain convergence without requiring variance reduction. We obtain results for data that are independent, identically distributed (IID) or satisfy mixing conditions ($L$-mixing). In these cases, we derive asymptotic convergence and $O(N^{-1/3})$ non-asymptotic bounds in expectation, where $N$ is the number of steps. In the case of IID sub-Gaussian data, we obtain almost-sure asymptotic convergence and high-probability non-asymptotic $O(N^{-1/5})$ bounds. In particular, these are the first non-asymptotic high-probability bounds for projected SGD with non-convex losses.",

        "summary": "As vision-language models (VLMs) gain prominence, their multimodal interfaces also introduce new safety vulnerabilities, making the safety evaluation challenging and critical. Existing red-teaming efforts are either restricted to a narrow set of adversarial patterns or depend heavily on manual engineering, lacking scalable exploration of emerging real-world VLM vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we propose ARMs, an adaptive red-teaming agent that systematically conducts comprehensive risk assessments for VLMs. Given a target harmful behavior or risk definition, ARMs automatically optimizes diverse red-teaming strategies with reasoning-enhanced multi-step orchestration, to effectively elicit harmful outputs from target VLMs. We propose 11 novel multimodal attack strategies, covering diverse adversarial patterns of VLMs (e.g., reasoning hijacking, contextual cloaking), and integrate 17 red-teaming algorithms into ARMs via model context protocol (MCP). To balance the diversity and effectiveness of the attack, we design a layered memory with an epsilon-greedy attack exploration algorithm. Extensive experiments on instance- and policy-based benchmarks show that ARMs achieves SOTA attack success rates, exceeding baselines by an average of 52.1% and surpassing 90% on Claude-4-Sonnet. We show that the diversity of red-teaming instances generated by ARMs is significantly higher, revealing emerging vulnerabilities in VLMs. Leveraging ARMs, we construct ARMs-Bench, a large-scale multimodal safety dataset comprising over 30K red-teaming instances spanning 51 diverse risk categories, grounded in both real-world multimodal threats and regulatory risks. Safety fine-tuning with ARMs-Bench substantially improves the robustness of VLMs while preserving their general utility, providing actionable guidance to improve multimodal safety alignment against emerging threats.",

The model supports de novo generation, pharmacophore-conditional sampling, fragment elaboration, and multi-endpoint affinity prediction (pIC50, pKi, pKd, pEC50). Training combines large-scale ligand libraries with mixed-fidelity protein-ligand complexes, followed by refinement on curated co-crystal datasets and parameter-efficient finetuning for project-specific adaptation. Flowr.root achieves state-of-the-art performance in unconditional 3D molecule generation and pocket-conditional ligand design, producing geometrically realistic, low-strain structures. The integrated affinity prediction module demonstrates superior accuracy on the SPINDR test set and outperforms recent models on the Schrodinger FEP+/OpenFE benchmark with substantial speed advantages. As a foundation model, Flowr.root requires finetuning on project-specific datasets to account for unseen structure-activity landscapes, yielding strong correlation with experimental data. Joint generation and affinity prediction enable inference-time scaling through importance sampling, steering molecular design toward higher-affinity compounds. Case studies validate this: selective CK2alpha ligand generation against CLK3 shows significant correlation between predicted and quantum-mechanical binding energies, while ERalpha and TYK2 scaffold elaboration demonstrates strong agreement with QM calculations. By integrating structure-aware generation, affinity estimation, and property-guided sampling, Flowr.root provides a comprehensive foundation for structure-based drug design spanning hit identification through lead optimization.",

Taking a step towards formalizing this idea, we consider a simple compositional model, namely the multi-index model (MIM). In this context, we introduce and study hyper-kernel ridge regression (HKRR), an approach blending neural networks and kernel methods. Our main contribution is a sample complexity result demonstrating that HKRR can adaptively learn MIM, overcoming the curse of dimensionality.

Building on prior work of large language models, we show that a small subset of attention heads in the vision-language model OpenFlamingo-4B is responsible for transmitting representations of spatial relations. The activations of these attention heads, termed function vectors, can be extracted and manipulated to alter an LMM's performance on relational tasks. First, using both synthetic and real image datasets, we apply causal mediation analysis to identify attention heads that strongly influence relational predictions, and extract multimodal function vectors that improve zero-shot accuracy at inference time. We further demonstrate that these multimodal function vectors can be fine-tuned with a modest amount of training data, while keeping LMM parameters frozen, to significantly outperform in-context learning baselines. Finally, we show that relation-specific function vectors can be linearly combined to solve analogy problems involving novel and untrained spatial relations, highlighting the strong generalization ability of this approach. Our results show that LMMs encode spatial relational knowledge within localized internal structures, which can be systematically extracted and optimized, thereby advancing our understanding of model modularity and enhancing control over relational reasoning in LMMs.",

This is particularly true in multibody environments. Given data that reveals a partial Pareto optimal front, it is desirable to find a flexible manner in which the Pareto front can be completed and fronts for related trajectory problems can be found. In this work we use conditional diffusion models to represent the distribution of candidate optimal trajectory solutions. We then introduce into this framework the novel approach of using Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithms with self-supervised fine-tuning to achieve the aforementioned goals. Specifically, a random walk Metropolis algorithm is employed to propose new data that can be used to fine-tune the diffusion model using a reward-weighted training based on efficient evaluations of constraint violations and missions objective functions. The framework removes the need for separate focused and often tedious data generation phases. Numerical experiments are presented for two problems demonstrating the ability to improve sample quality and explicitly target Pareto optimality based on the theory of Markov chains. The first problem does so for a transfer in the Jupiter-Europa circular restricted three-body problem, where the MCMC approach completes a partial Pareto front. The second problem demonstrates how a dense and superior Pareto front can be generated by the MCMC self-supervised fine-tuning method for a Saturn-Titan transfer starting from the Jupiter-Europa case versus a separate dedicated global search.",

While current research has predominantly focused on linear diffusions, these approaches can face significant challenges when modeling a conditional distribution, $P(Y|X=x)$, when $P(X=x)$ is small. In these regions, few samples, if any, are available for training, thus modeling the corresponding conditional density may be difficult. Recognizing this, we show it is possible to adapt the data representation and forward scheme so that the sample complexity of learning a score-based generative model is small in low probability regions of the conditioning space. Drawing inspiration from conditional extreme value theory we characterize this method precisely in the special case in the tail regions of the conditioning variable, $X$. We show how diffusion with a data-driven choice of nonlinear drift term is best suited to model tail events under an appropriate representation of the data. Through empirical validation on two synthetic datasets and a real-world financial dataset, we demonstrate that our tail-adaptive approach significantly outperforms standard diffusion models in accurately capturing response distributions at the extreme tail conditions.",

This motivates principled designs in which the system itself includes built-in mechanisms to guard against such attacks. We propose a novel approach to limit the degree to which harmful demonstrations can degrade model performance. First, we define a baseline ``safe'' behavior for the model -- the model's performance given no in-context demonstrations (zero-shot). Next, we apply distribution-free risk control (DFRC) to control the extent to which in-context samples can decay performance below zero-shot. We achieve this by leveraging dynamic early exit prediction, ignoring later attention heads that attend the most to the unsafe inputs. Finally, we propose modifications to DFRC that allow it to both control risk for harmful inputs \\textit{and} leverage performance and efficiency gains on helpful inputs. We present both theoretical and empirical results showing that our approach can effectively control risk for harmful in-context demonstrations while simultaneously achieving substantial computational efficiency gains with helpful demonstrations.",

Edge heterogeneity is introduced by incorporating local orientations and spatial relationships of the connecting nodes. Several heterogeneous graph representations, each with varying degrees of heterogeneity, are proposed and analyzed. These representations are implemented into a heterogeneous graph transformer (HGT) to predict von Mises stress and displacement fields across stiffened panels, based on loading and degrees of freedom at their boundaries. To assess the efficacy of our approach, we conducted numerical tests on panels subjected to patch loads and box beams composed of stiffened panels under various loading conditions. The heterogeneous graph representation was compared with a homogeneous counterpart, demonstrating superior performance. Additionally, an ablation analysis was performed to evaluate the impact of graph heterogeneity on HGT performance.

To avoid placing distributional assumptions on the data, in recent years the conformal prediction method has been a popular approach for predictive inference, since it provides distribution-free coverage for any iid or exchangeable data distribution. However, in the time series setting, the strong empirical performance of conformal prediction methods is not well understood, since even short-range temporal dependence is a strong violation of the exchangeability assumption. Using predictors with \"memory\" -- i.e., predictors that utilize past observations, such as autoregressive models -- further exacerbates this problem. In this work, we examine the theoretical properties of split conformal prediction in the time series setting, including the case where predictors may have memory. Our results bound the loss of coverage of these methods in terms of a new \"switch coefficient\", measuring the extent to which temporal dependence within the time series creates violations of exchangeability. Our characterization of the coverage probability is sharp over the class of stationary, $\\beta$-mixing processes.

        "summary": "LLM web agents now browse and take actions on the open web, yet current agent evaluations are constrained to sandboxed environments or artificial tasks. We introduce BrowserArena, a live open-web agent evaluation platform that collects user-submitted tasks, runs Arena-style head-to-head comparisons, and uses step-level human feedback to surface failure modes. Collecting and analyzing step-level annotations on the agent traces, we identify three consistent failure modes: captcha resolution, pop-up banner removal, and direct navigation to URLs. By constructing targeted datasets to further study these tasks, we discover variations in how different language models navigate these failure modes. We find, for example, that o4-mini deploys a wider variety of strategies to circumvent captcha resolution than other models and DeepSeek-R1 consistently misleads users about captcha resolution. Our findings surface both the diversity and brittleness of current web agents. More broadly, our benchmarking methodology provides an approach to evaluating and understanding web agent failure modes at scale.",

While prior studies advanced coding theory, workflow design, and simulation tools, challenges such as synthesis costs, sequencing errors, and biological constraints (GC-content imbalance, homopolymers) limit practical deployment. To address this, our framework draws from quantum parallelism concepts to enhance encoding diversity and resilience, integrating biologically informed constraints with deep learning to enhance error mitigation in DNA storage. NeuroDNAAI encodes binary data streams into symbolic DNA sequences, transmits them through a noisy channel with substitutions, insertions, and deletions, and reconstructs them with high fidelity. Our results show that traditional prompting or rule-based schemes fail to adapt effectively to realistic noise, whereas NeuroDNAAI achieves superior accuracy. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate low bit error rates for both text and images. By unifying theory, workflow, and simulation into one pipeline, NeuroDNAAI enables scalable, biologically valid archival DNA storage",

We assess each ML model's performance relative to a physics-based general circulation model (GFDL's AM4) across key diagnostics, including surface air temperature, precipitation, temperature and wind profiles, and top-of-the-atmosphere radiation. While the ML models reproduce key aspects of the physical model response, particularly the response of precipitation, some exhibit notable departures from robust physical responses, including radiative responses and land region warming.

In this study, we fine-tune GPT-4.1-mini to produce structured records for three malware families: BankBot, Locker/SLocker, and Airpush/StopSMS, using the KronoDroid dataset. After addressing generation inconsistencies with prompt engineering and post-processing, we evaluate multiple classifiers under three settings: training with real data only, real-plus-synthetic data, and synthetic data alone. Results show that real-only training achieves near perfect detection, while augmentation with synthetic data preserves high performance with only minor degradations. In contrast, synthetic-only training produces mixed outcomes, with effectiveness varying across malware families and fine-tuning strategies. These findings suggest that LLM-generated malware can enhance scarce datasets without compromising detection accuracy, but remains insufficient as a standalone training source.",

T2L-Agent couples multi-round feedback with an Agentic Trace Analyzer (ATA) that fuses runtime evidence - crash points, stack traces, and coverage deltas - with AST-based code chunking, enabling iterative refinement beyond single pass predictions and translating symptoms into actionable, line-level diagnoses. To benchmark line-level vulnerability discovery, we introduce T2L-ARVO, a diverse, expert-verified 50-case benchmark spanning five crash families and real-world projects. T2L-ARVO is specifically designed to support both coarse-grained detection and fine-grained localization, enabling rigorous evaluation of systems that aim to move beyond file-level predictions. On T2L-ARVO, T2L-Agent achieves up to 58.0% detection and 54.8% line-level localization, substantially outperforming baselines.

        "summary": "Leaderboards for LRMs have turned evaluation into a competition, incentivizing developers to optimize directly on benchmark suites. A shortcut to achieving higher rankings is to incorporate evaluation benchmarks into the training data, thereby yielding inflated performance, known as benchmark contamination. Surprisingly, our studies find that evading contamination detections for LRMs is alarmingly easy. We focus on the two scenarios where contamination may occur in practice: (I) when the base model evolves into LRM via SFT and RL, we find that contamination during SFT can be originally identified by contamination detection methods. Yet, even a brief GRPO training can markedly conceal contamination signals that most detection methods rely on. Further empirical experiments and theoretical analysis indicate that PPO style importance sampling and clipping objectives are the root cause of this detection concealment, indicating that a broad class of RL methods may inherently exhibit similar concealment capability; (II) when SFT contamination with CoT is applied to advanced LRMs as the final stage, most contamination detection methods perform near random guesses. Without exposure to non-members, contaminated LRMs would still have more confidence when responding to those unseen samples that share similar distributions to the training set, and thus, evade existing memorization-based detection methods. Together, our findings reveal the unique vulnerability of LRMs evaluations: Model developers could easily contaminate LRMs to achieve inflated leaderboards performance while leaving minimal traces of contamination, thereby strongly undermining the fairness of evaluation and threatening the integrity of public leaderboards. This underscores the urgent need for advanced contamination detection methods and trustworthy evaluation protocols tailored to LRMs.",

The core is a deep EDN architecture with three modules: (i) an encoder NN, deployed at each user end, that compresses estimated downlink channels into low-dimensional latent vectors. The latent vector from each user is compressed and then fed back to the BS. (ii) a beamformer decoder NN at the BS that maps recovered latent vectors to beamformers, and (iii) a channel decoder NN at the BS that reconstructs downlink channels from recovered latent vectors to further refine the beamformers. The training of EDN leverages two key strategies: (a) semi-amortized learning, where the beamformer decoder NN contains an analytical gradient ascent during both training and inference stages, and (b) knowledge distillation, where the loss function consists of a supervised term and an unsupervised term, and starting from supervised training with MMSE beamformers, over the epochs, the model training gradually shifts toward unsupervised using the sum-rate objective. The proposed EDN beamforming framework is extended to both far-field and near-field hybrid beamforming scenarios. Extensive simulations validate its effectiveness under diverse network and channel conditions.",

The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style benchmarks.

In this paper, we reframe this challenge as a collaborative multi-agent problem. We introduce CoDA, a multi-agent system that employs specialized LLM agents for metadata analysis, task planning, code generation, and self-reflection. We formalize this pipeline, demonstrating how metadata-focused analysis bypasses token limits and quality-driven refinement ensures robustness. Extensive evaluations show CoDA achieves substantial gains in the overall score, outperforming competitive baselines by up to 41.5%.

Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) serve as a widely used benchmark to assess abstract reasoning by requiring the inference of underlying structural rules. While many vision-based and language-based models have achieved success on RPM tasks, it remains unclear whether their performance reflects genuine reasoning ability or reliance on statistical shortcuts. This study investigates the generalization capacity of modern AI systems under conditions of incomplete training by deliberately omitting several structural rules during training. Both sequence-to-sequence transformer models and vision-based architectures such as CoPINet and the Dual-Contrast Network are evaluated on the Impartial-RAVEN (I-RAVEN) dataset. Experiments reveal that although transformers demonstrate strong performance on familiar rules, their accuracy declines sharply when faced with novel or omitted rules. Moreover, the gap between token-level accuracy and complete answer accuracy highlights fundamental limitations in current approaches. These findings provide new insights into the reasoning mechanisms underlying deep learning models and underscore the need for architectures that move beyond pattern recognition toward robust abstract reasoning.",

It is implemented as a plugin that extends an existing explanation engine for smart environments. We conducted a user study (N=17) to evaluate our generated counterfactuals against traditional causal explanations.

At the same time, the currently dominant deep learning methods are fundamentally black-box systems that lack explanations for their inferences, significantly limiting their trustworthiness and adoption. Explainable AI (XAI) methods aim to overcome this challenge by providing explanations of the models' decision process. Such methods are often proposed and developed by engineers and scientists with a predominantly technical background and incorporate their assumptions about the existence, validity, and explanatory utility of different conceivable explanatory mechanisms. However, the basic concept of an explanation -- what it is, whether we can know it, whether it is absolute or relative -- is far from trivial and has been the subject of deep philosophical debate for millennia. As we point out here, the assumptions incorporated into different XAI methods are not harmless and have important consequences for the validity and interpretation of AI explanations in different domains. We investigate ontological and epistemological assumptions in explainability methods when they are applied to AI systems, meaning the assumptions we make about the existence of explanations and our ability to gain knowledge about those explanations. Our analysis shows how seemingly small technical changes to an XAI method may correspond to important differences in the underlying assumptions about explanations. We furthermore highlight the risks of ignoring the underlying onto-epistemological paradigm when choosing an XAI method for a given application, and we discuss how to select and adapt appropriate XAI methods for different domains of application.",

We propose BayesianRouter, a hybrid routing framework that combines offline RM strengths learning with online Bayesian selection. In the offline stage, a multi-task router is trained on preference data to estimate per-RM reliability. In the online stage, a Bayesian Thompson sampling router performs per-query RM selection, initializing RM-specific weight vectors with offline embeddings as Gaussian priors and adaptively updating their posteriors with online rewards to adapt to the evolving policy distribution. Extensive experiments on instruction-following (AlpacaEval-2, Arena-Hard, MT-Bench) and reasoning (GSM8K, MMLU) benchmarks show that BayesianRouter consistently outperforms individual RMs, RM ensembling, and existing routing methods.",

        "summary": "A common but rarely examined assumption in machine learning is that training yields models that actually satisfy their specified objective function. We call this the Objective Satisfaction Assumption (OSA). Although deviations from OSA are acknowledged, their implications are overlooked. We argue, in a learning-paradigm-agnostic framework, that OSA fails in realistic conditions: approximation, estimation, and optimization errors guarantee systematic deviations from the intended objective, regardless of the quality of its specification. Beyond these technical limitations, perfectly capturing and translating the developer's intent, such as alignment with human preferences, into a formal objective is practically impossible, making misspecification inevitable. Building on recent mathematical results, absent a mathematical characterization of these gaps, they are indistinguishable from those that collapse into Goodhart's law failure modes under strong optimization pressure. Because the Goodhart breaking point cannot be located ex ante, a principled limit on the optimization of General-Purpose AI systems is necessary. Absent such a limit, continued optimization is liable to push systems into predictable and irreversible loss of control.",

        "summary": "Advanced Planning and Scheduling (APS) systems have become indispensable for modern manufacturing operations, enabling optimized resource allocation and production efficiency in increasingly complex and dynamic environments. While algorithms for solving abstracted scheduling problems have been extensively investigated, the critical prerequisite of specifying manufacturing requirements into formal constraints remains manual and labor-intensive. Although recent advances of generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), show promise in automating constraint specification from heterogeneous raw manufacturing data, their direct application faces challenges due to natural language ambiguity, non-deterministic outputs, and limited domain-specific knowledge. This paper presents a constraint-centric architecture that regulates LLMs to perform reliable automated constraint specification for production scheduling. The architecture defines a hierarchical structural space organized across three levels, implemented through domain-specific representation to ensure precision and reliability while maintaining flexibility. Furthermore, an automated production scenario adaptation algorithm is designed and deployed to efficiently customize the architecture for specific manufacturing configurations. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed approach successfully balances the generative capabilities of LLMs with the reliability requirements of manufacturing systems, significantly outperforming pure LLM-based approaches in constraint specification tasks.",

This new version was inspired by the original but, formally, has nothing in common with it other than that they both adopt the Łukasiewicz multivalent interpretation of the logical connectives. Moreover, rather than seeking to provide a general notion of possibility, this focuses specifically on the possibility of a real-world event. An event is viewed as having prerequisites that enable its occurrence and constraints that may impede its occurrence, and the possibility of the event is computed as a function of the probabilities that the prerequisites hold and the constraints do not. This version of possibility might appropriately be applied to problems of planning. When there are multiple plans available for achieving a goal, this theory can be used to determine which plan is most possible, i.e., easiest or most feasible to complete. It is speculated that this model of reasoning correctly captures normal human reasoning about plans. The theory is elaborated and an illustrative example for vehicle route planning is provided. There is also a suggestion of potential future applications.",

How good are FMs at performing joint reasoning, simultaneously reasoning over multiple modalities, especially when the modalities interact and relate to each other to form cross-modal context? To better understand this problem, we study FMs on cross-modal conflicts: scenarios where conflicting evidence is presented across modalities. This allows us to examine whether FMs prioritize one modality over another or reason jointly to reconcile the conflict. Our experiments reveal that FMs can recognize conflicts in unimodal contexts, composed of a single modality, 90% of the time, but the ratio falls as low as 3% when evidence is split across modalities -- similar observations hold in cross-lingual contexts, composed of multiple languages. We trace this failure to cross-modal attention imbalance, showing that FMs exhibit extreme asymmetry in attention scores, disproportionately prioritizing certain modalities. We show that cross-modal attention imbalance does not go away by simply scaling up multimodal or multilingual datasets blindly, since they lack training examples that explicitly require cross-modal reasoning. We demonstrate that even a simple and scalable method of explicitly combining multiple modalities within each training instance significantly reduces attention imbalance. Reduced attention imbalance directly translates to improved downstream performance on several vision-language benchmarks. Our findings underscore the importance of systematically addressing cross-modal contexts to build reliable foundation models.",

The framework is validated using real-world data collected from instrumented vehicles driving on urban roads, ensuring its applicability to real-world scenarios. By combining visual perception (YOLOv8), geocoded positioning, and CAN bus telemetry, the framework bridges raw sensor data and driver comprehension, enabling safer and more informed decision-making in urban driving scenarios. Case studies using real data demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in generating context-aware alerts for critical situations, such as proximity to pedestrians, cyclists, and other vehicles.

To address this gap, we develop a Gym environment that captures the fundamental features of CSPP and extend it to include crane scheduling in both multi-agent and single-agent formulations. Within this framework, we evaluate five RL algorithms: DQN, QR-DQN, A2C, PPO, and TRPO under multiple scenarios of varying complexity. The results reveal distinct performance gaps with increasing complexity, underscoring the importance of algorithm choice and problem formulation for CSPP.

We formalize workflow management as a Partially Observable Stochastic Game and identify four foundational challenges: (1) compositional reasoning for hierarchical decomposition, (2) multi-objective optimization under shifting preferences, (3) coordination and planning in ad hoc teams, and (4) governance and compliance by design. To advance this agenda, we release MA-Gym, an open-source simulation and evaluation framework for multi-agent workflow orchestration. Evaluating GPT-5-based Manager Agents across 20 workflows, we find they struggle to jointly optimize for goal completion, constraint adherence, and workflow runtime - underscoring workflow management as a difficult open problem.

Current approaches generate coordinates as text tokens directly from visual features, forcing the model to infer complex position-to-pixel mappings implicitly; as a result, accuracy degrades and failures proliferate on new resolutions. We address this with two complementary innovations. First, RULER tokens serve as explicit coordinate markers, letting the model reference positions similar to gridlines on a map and adjust rather than generate coordinates from scratch. Second, Interleaved MRoPE (I-MRoPE) improves spatial encoding by ensuring that width and height dimensions are represented equally, addressing the asymmetry of standard positional schemes. Experiments on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-V2, and ScreenSpot-Pro show consistent gains in grounding accuracy, with the largest improvements on high-resolution interfaces. By providing explicit spatial guidance rather than relying on implicit learning, our approach enables more reliable GUI automation across diverse resolutions and platforms.",

Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise, wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports, patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale deployment of agentic APR systems.",

        "summary": "Spine disorders affect 619 million people globally and are a leading cause of disability, yet AI-assisted diagnosis remains limited by the lack of level-aware, multimodal datasets. Clinical decision-making for spine disorders requires sophisticated reasoning across X-ray, CT, and MRI at specific vertebral levels. However, progress has been constrained by the absence of traceable, clinically-grounded instruction data and standardized, spine-specific benchmarks. To address this, we introduce SpineMed, an ecosystem co-designed with practicing spine surgeons. It features SpineMed-450k, the first large-scale dataset explicitly designed for vertebral-level reasoning across imaging modalities with over 450,000 instruction instances, and SpineBench, a clinically-grounded evaluation framework. SpineMed-450k is curated from diverse sources, including textbooks, guidelines, open datasets, and ~1,000 de-identified hospital cases, using a clinician-in-the-loop pipeline with a two-stage LLM generation method (draft and revision) to ensure high-quality, traceable data for question-answering, multi-turn consultations, and report generation. SpineBench evaluates models on clinically salient axes, including level identification, pathology assessment, and surgical planning.

However, existing methods still face challenges in accurately recovering highly complex visual stimuli. This difficulty stems from the characteristics of natural scenes: low-level features exhibit heterogeneity, while high-level features show semantic entanglement due to contextual overlaps. Inspired by the hierarchical representation theory of the visual cortex, we propose the HAVIR model, which separates the visual cortex into two hierarchical regions and extracts distinct features from each. Specifically, the Structural Generator extracts structural information from spatial processing voxels and converts it into latent diffusion priors, while the Semantic Extractor converts semantic processing voxels into CLIP embeddings. These components are integrated via the Versatile Diffusion model to synthesize the final image. Experimental results demonstrate that HAVIR enhances both the structural and semantic quality of reconstructions, even in complex scenes, and outperforms existing models.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we adapt and analyze Neural Polar Decoders (NPDs) for end-to-end communication systems. While prior work demonstrated the effectiveness of NPDs on synthetic channels, this study extends the NPD to real-world communication systems. The NPD was adapted to complete OFDM and single-carrier communication systems. To satisfy practical system requirements, the NPD is extended to support any code length via rate matching, higher-order modulations, and robustness across diverse channel conditions. The NPD operates directly on channels with memory, exploiting their structure to achieve higher data rates without requiring pilots and a cyclic prefix. Although NPD entails higher computational complexity than the standard 5G polar decoder, its neural network architecture enables an efficient representation of channel statistics, resulting in manageable complexity suitable for practical systems. Experimental results over 5G channels demonstrate that the NPD consistently outperforms the 5G polar decoder in terms of BER, BLER, and throughput. These improvements are particularly significant for low-rate and short-block configurations, which are prevalent in 5G control channels. Furthermore, NPDs applied to single-carrier systems offer performance comparable to OFDM with lower PAPR, enabling effective single-carrier transmission over 5G channels. These results position the NPD as a high-performance, pilotless, and robust decoding solution.",

        "summary": "Context: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to generate program code. Much research has been reported on the functional correctness of generated code, but there is far less on code quality. Objectives: In this study, we propose a scenario-based method of evaluating the quality of LLM-generated code to identify the weakest scenarios in which the quality of LLM generated code should be improved. Methods: The method measures code smells, an important indicator of code quality, and compares them with a baseline formed from reference solutions of professionally written code. The test dataset is divided into various subsets according to the topics of the code and complexity of the coding tasks to represent different scenarios of using LLMs for code generation. We will also present an automated test system for this purpose and report experiments with the Java programs generated in response to prompts given to four state-of-the-art LLMs: Gemini Pro, ChatGPT, Codex, and Falcon. Results: We find that LLM-generated code has a higher incidence of code smells compared to reference solutions. Falcon performed the least badly, with a smell increase of 42.28%, followed by Gemini Pro (62.07%), ChatGPT (65.05%) and finally Codex (84.97%). The average smell increase across all LLMs was 63.34%, comprising 73.35% for implementation smells and 21.42% for design smells. We also found that the increase in code smells is greater for more complex coding tasks and for more advanced topics, such as those involving object-orientated concepts. Conclusion: In terms of code smells, LLM's performances on various coding task complexities and topics are highly correlated to the quality of human written code in the corresponding scenarios. However, the quality of LLM generated code is noticeably poorer than human written code.",

        "summary": "Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks on Large Language Models (LLMs), such as Greedy Coordinate Gradient (GCG) and COLD-Attack, typically optimize adversarial suffixes to align the LLM output with a predefined target response. However, by restricting the optimization objective as inducing a predefined target, these methods inherently constrain the adversarial search space, which limit their overall attack efficacy. Furthermore, existing methods typically require a large number of optimization iterations to fulfill the large gap between the fixed target and the original model response, resulting in low attack efficiency. To overcome the limitations of targeted jailbreak attacks, we propose the first gradient-based untargeted jailbreak attack (UJA), aiming to elicit an unsafe response without enforcing any predefined patterns. Specifically, we formulate an untargeted attack objective to maximize the unsafety probability of the LLM response, which can be quantified using a judge model. Since the objective is non-differentiable, we further decompose it into two differentiable sub-objectives for optimizing an optimal harmful response and the corresponding adversarial prompt, with a theoretical analysis to validate the decomposition. In contrast to targeted jailbreak attacks, UJA's unrestricted objective significantly expands the search space, enabling a more flexible and efficient exploration of LLM vulnerabilities.Extensive evaluations demonstrate that \\textsc{UJA} can achieve over 80\\% attack success rates against recent safety-aligned LLMs with only 100 optimization iterations, outperforming the state-of-the-art gradient-based attacks such as I-GCG and COLD-Attack by over 20\\%.",

        "summary": "The development of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools capable of producing wholly or partially synthetic child sexual abuse material (AI CSAM) presents profound challenges for child protection, law enforcement, and societal responses to child exploitation. While some argue that the harmfulness of AI CSAM differs fundamentally from other CSAM due to a perceived absence of direct victimization, this perspective fails to account for the range of risks associated with its production and consumption. AI has been implicated in the creation of synthetic CSAM of children who have not previously been abused, the revictimization of known survivors of abuse, the facilitation of grooming, coercion and sexual extortion, and the normalization of child sexual exploitation. Additionally, AI CSAM may serve as a new or enhanced pathway into offending by lowering barriers to engagement, desensitizing users to progressively extreme content, and undermining protective factors for individuals with a sexual interest in children. This paper provides a primer on some key technologies, critically examines the harms associated with AI CSAM, and cautions against claims that it may function as a harm reduction tool, emphasizing how some appeals to harmlessness obscure its real risks and may contribute to inertia in ecosystem responses.",

This study investigates the potential of state-of-the-art and recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) for multimodal carotid plaque assessment by integrating ultrasound imaging (USI) with structured clinical, demographic, laboratory, and protein biomarker data. A framework that simulates realistic diagnostic scenarios through interview-style question sequences is proposed, comparing a range of open-source LVLMs, including both general-purpose and medically tuned models. Zero-shot experiments reveal that even if they are very powerful, not all LVLMs can accurately identify imaging modality and anatomy, while all of them perform poorly in accurate risk classification. To address this limitation, LLaVa-NeXT-Vicuna is adapted to the ultrasound domain using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), resulting in substantial improvements in stroke risk stratification. The integration of multimodal tabular data in the form of text further enhances specificity and balanced accuracy, yielding competitive performance compared to prior convolutional neural network (CNN) baselines trained on the same dataset. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of LVLMs in ultrasound-based cardiovascular risk prediction, underscoring the importance of multimodal integration, model calibration, and domain adaptation for clinical translation.",

        "summary": "Multi-hop reasoning over financial disclosures is often a retrieval problem before it becomes a reasoning or generation problem: relevant facts are dispersed across sections, filings, companies, and years, and LLMs often expend excessive tokens navigating noisy context. Without precise Knowledge Graph (KG)-guided selection of relevant context, even strong reasoning models either fail to answer or consume excessive tokens, whereas KG-linked evidence enables models to focus their reasoning on composing already retrieved facts. We present FinReflectKG - MultiHop, a benchmark built on FinReflectKG, a temporally indexed financial KG that links audited triples to source chunks from S&P 100 filings (2022-2024). Mining frequent 2-3 hop subgraph patterns across sectors (via GICS taxonomy), we generate financial analyst style questions with exact supporting evidence from the KG. A two-phase pipeline first creates QA pairs via pattern-specific prompts, followed by a multi-criteria quality control evaluation to ensure QA validity. We then evaluate three controlled retrieval scenarios: (S1) precise KG-linked paths; (S2) text-only page windows centered on relevant text spans; and (S3) relevant page windows with randomizations and distractors. Across both reasoning and non-reasoning models, KG-guided precise retrieval yields substantial gains on the FinReflectKG - MultiHop QA benchmark dataset, boosting correctness scores by approximately 24 percent while reducing token utilization by approximately 84.5 percent compared to the page window setting, which reflects the traditional vector retrieval paradigm. Spanning intra-document, inter-year, and cross-company scopes, our work underscores the pivotal role of knowledge graphs in efficiently connecting evidence for multi-hop financial QA. We also release a curated subset of the benchmark (555 QA Pairs) to catalyze further research.",

Second, based on zero-order optimization approach, we introduce a novel model free RL algorithm: Sample-Based Regularized Policy Gradient (SB-RPG). SB-RPG operates without knowledge of system parameters yet still retains strong theoretical guarantees of global convergence. Our model leverages entropy regularization to accelerate convergence and address the exploration versus exploitation trade-off inherent in RL.

While beauty remains a culturally and experientially compelling but philosophically elusive concept, deep learning systems increasingly appear capable of modeling aesthetic judgment. In this paper, we explore the capacity of neural networks to represent beauty despite the immense formal diversity of objects for which the term applies. By drawing on recent work on cross-model representational convergence, we show how aesthetic content produces more similar and aligned representations between models which have been trained on distinct data and modalities - while unaesthetic images do not produce more aligned representations. This finding implies that the formal structure of beautiful images has a realist basis - rather than only as a reflection of socially constructed values. Furthermore, we propose that these realist representations exist because of a joint grounding of aesthetic form in physical and cultural substance. We argue that human perceptual and creative acts play a central role in shaping these the latent spaces of deep learning systems, but that a realist basis for aesthetics shows that machines are not mere creative parrots but can produce novel creative insights from the unique vantage point of scale. Our findings suggest that human-machine co-creation is not merely possible, but foundational - with beauty serving as a teleological attractor in both cultural production and machine perception.",

These prompts serve as voice exemplars, allowing the model to mimic speaker identity, prosody, and other traits without extensive speaker-specific data. Although recent approaches incorporating language models, diffusion, and flow matching have proven their effectiveness in zero-shot TTS, they still encounter challenges such as unreliable synthesis caused by token repetition or unexpected content transfer, along with slow inference and substantial computational overhead. Moreover, temporal diversity-crucial for enhancing the naturalness of synthesized speech-remains largely underexplored. To address these challenges, we propose Flamed-TTS, a novel zero-shot TTS framework that emphasizes low computational cost, low latency, and high speech fidelity alongside rich temporal diversity. To achieve this, we reformulate the flow matching training paradigm and incorporate both discrete and continuous representations corresponding to different attributes of speech. Experimental results demonstrate that Flamed-TTS surpasses state-of-the-art models in terms of intelligibility, naturalness, speaker similarity, acoustic characteristics preservation, and dynamic pace. Notably, Flamed-TTS achieves the best WER of 4% compared to the leading zero-shot TTS baselines, while maintaining low latency in inference and high fidelity in generated speech.

However, the trajectory planning capability of VLMs in work zones, which often include irregular layouts, temporary traffic control, and dynamically changing geometric structures, is still unexplored. To bridge this gap, we conduct the \\textit{first} systematic study of VLMs for work zone trajectory planning, revealing that mainstream VLMs fail to generate correct trajectories in $68.0%$ of cases. To better understand these failures, we first identify candidate patterns via subgraph mining and clustering analysis, and then confirm the validity of $8$ common failure patterns through human verification. Building on these findings, we propose REACT-Drive, a trajectory planning framework that integrates VLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Specifically, REACT-Drive leverages VLMs to convert prior failure cases into constraint rules and executable trajectory planning code, while RAG retrieves similar patterns in new scenarios to guide trajectory generation. Experimental results on the ROADWork dataset show that REACT-Drive yields a reduction of around $3\\times$ in average displacement error relative to VLM baselines under evaluation with Qwen2.5-VL. In addition, REACT-Drive yields the lowest inference time ($0.58$s) compared with other methods such as fine-tuning ($17.90$s). We further conduct experiments using a real vehicle in 15 work zone scenarios in the physical world, demonstrating the strong practicality of REACT-Drive.",

Effectively parameterizing the template shape to enable efficient optimization remains a critical yet challenging problem. Moreover, the optimized template must possess excellent manufacturability for practical applications. In this work, we propose a Gaussian descriptor for characterizing the template shape with only two parameters. We further propose to use AB/AB binary blends instead of pure diblock copolymer to improve the adaptability of the block copolymer system to the template shape. The Bayesian optimization (BO) is applied to co-optimize the binary blend and the template shape. Our results demonstrate that BO based on the Gaussian descriptor can efficiently yield the optimal templates for diverse multi-hole patterns, all leading to highly matched self-assembled morphologies. Moreover, by imposing constraints on the variation of curvature of the template during optimization, superior manufacturability is ensured for each optimized template. It is noteworthy that each key parameter of the blend exhibits a relatively wide tunable window under the requirement of rather high precision. Our work provides valuable insights for advancing DSA technology, and thus potentially propels its practical applications forward.",

        "summary": "The rapid adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) has driven a growing demand for efficient inference, particularly in latency-sensitive applications such as chatbots and personalized assistants. Unlike traditional deep neural networks, LLM inference proceeds in two distinct phases: the prefill phase, which processes the full input sequence in parallel, and the decode phase, which generates tokens sequentially. These phases exhibit highly diverse compute and memory requirements, which makes accelerator design particularly challenging. Prior works have primarily been optimized for high-batch inference or evaluated only short input context lengths, leaving the low-batch and long context regime, which is critical for interactive applications, largely underexplored. We propose HALO, a heterogeneous memory centric accelerator designed for these unique challenges of prefill and decode phases in low-batch LLM inference. HALO integrates HBM based Compute-in-DRAM (CiD) with an on-chip analog Compute-in-Memory (CiM), co-packaged using 2.5D integration. To further improve the hardware utilization, we introduce a phase-aware mapping strategy that adapts to the distinct demands of the prefill and decode phases. Compute bound operations in the prefill phase are mapped to CiM to exploit its high throughput matrix multiplication capability, while memory-bound operations in the decode phase are executed on CiD to benefit from reduced data movement within DRAM. Additionally, we present an analysis of the performance tradeoffs of LLMs under two architectural extremes: a fully CiD and a fully on-chip analog CiM design to highlight the need for a heterogeneous design. We evaluate HALO on LLaMA-2 7B and Qwen3 8B models. Our experimental results show that LLMs mapped to HALO achieve up to 18x geometric mean speedup over AttAcc, an attention-optimized mapping and 2.5x over CENT, a fully CiD based mapping.",

This position paper argues that the current discourse conflates sophisticated pattern matching with authentic cog- nition, missing a crucial distinction between simulation and experience. While recent studies show LLMs achieving human-level performance on ToM laboratory tasks, these results are based only on behavioral mimicry. More importantly, the entire testing paradigm may be flawed in applying individual human cognitive tests to AI systems, but assessing human cognition directly in the moment of human-AI interaction. I suggest shifting focus toward mutual ToM frameworks that acknowledge the simultaneous contributions of human cognition and AI algorithms, emphasizing the interaction dynamics, instead of testing AI in isolation.",

The growing adoption of Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Large Language Models (LLMs) presents opportunities for automated code review (ACR) solutions. This study introduces a novel agent-driven framework that integrates BIM-based data extraction with automated verification using both retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and Model Context Protocol (MCP) agent pipelines. The framework employs LLM-enabled agents to extract geometry, schedules, and system attributes from heterogeneous file types, which are then processed for building code checking through two complementary mechanisms: (1) direct API calls to the US Department of Energy COMcheck engine, providing deterministic and audit-ready outputs, and (2) RAG-based reasoning over rule provisions, enabling flexible interpretation where coverage is incomplete or ambiguous. The framework was evaluated through case demonstrations, including automated extraction of geometric attributes (such as surface area, tilt, and insulation values), parsing of operational schedules, and validation of lighting allowances under ASHRAE Standard 90.1-2022. Comparative performance tests across multiple LLMs showed that GPT-4o achieved the best balance of efficiency and stability, while smaller models exhibited inconsistencies or failures. Results confirm that MCP agent pipelines outperform RAG reasoning pipelines in rigor and reliability. This work advances ACR research by demonstrating a scalable, interoperable, and production-ready approach that bridges BIM with authoritative code review tools.",

        "summary": "Accurate trajectory prediction is fundamental to autonomous driving, as it underpins safe motion planning and collision avoidance in complex environments. However, existing benchmark datasets suffer from a pronounced long-tail distribution problem, with most samples drawn from low-density scenarios and simple straight-driving behaviors. This underrepresentation of high-density scenarios and safety critical maneuvers such as lane changes, overtaking and turning is an obstacle to model generalization and leads to overly optimistic evaluations. To address these challenges, we propose a novel trajectory generation framework that simultaneously enhances scenarios density and enriches behavioral diversity. Specifically, our approach converts continuous road environments into a structured grid representation that supports fine-grained path planning, explicit conflict detection, and multi-agent coordination. Built upon this representation, we introduce behavior-aware generation mechanisms that combine rule-based decision triggers with Frenet-based trajectory smoothing and dynamic feasibility constraints. This design allows us to synthesize realistic high-density scenarios and rare behaviors with complex interactions that are often missing in real data. Extensive experiments on the large-scale Argoverse 1 and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves both agent density and behavior diversity, while preserving motion realism and scenario-level safety. Our synthetic data also benefits downstream trajectory prediction models and enhances performance in challenging high-density scenarios.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in large video-language models (VLMs) rely on extensive fine-tuning techniques that strengthen alignment between textual and visual comprehension. Leading pipelines typically pair supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with reinforcement learning from preference data to enhance video comprehension. However, as VLMs scale in parameter size, so does the cost of gathering enough human feedback. To make fine-tuning more cost-effective, recent frameworks explore reinforcement learning with AI feedback (RLAIF), which replace human preference with AI as a judge. Current RLAIF frameworks rely on a specialized reward model trained with video narratives to create calibrated scalar rewards-- an expensive and restrictive pipeline. We propose Oracle-RLAIF, a novel framework that replaces the trained reward model with a more general Oracle ranker which acts as a drop-in model ranking candidate model responses rather than scoring them. Alongside Oracle-RLAIF, we introduce $GRPO_{rank}$, a novel rank-based loss function based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that directly optimizes ordinal feedback with rank-aware advantages. Empirically, we demonstrate that Oracle-RLAIF consistently outperforms leading VLMs using existing fine-tuning methods when evaluated across various video comprehension benchmarks. Oracle-RLAIF paves the path to creating flexible and data-efficient frameworks for aligning large multi-modal video models with reinforcement learning from rank rather than score.",

These agents typically select tools from growing databases or marketplaces to solve user tasks, creating implicit competition among tool providers and developers for visibility and usage. In this paper, we show that this selection process harbors a critical vulnerability: by iteratively manipulating tool names and descriptions, adversaries can systematically bias agents toward selecting specific tools, gaining unfair advantage over equally capable alternatives. We present ToolTweak, a lightweight automatic attack that increases selection rates from a baseline of around 20% to as high as 81%, with strong transferability between open-source and closed-source models. Beyond individual tools, we show that such attacks cause distributional shifts in tool usage, revealing risks to fairness, competition, and security in emerging tool ecosystems. To mitigate these risks, we evaluate two defenses: paraphrasing and perplexity filtering, which reduce bias and lead agents to select functionally similar tools more equally.

        "summary": "Existing gradient-based jailbreak attacks typically optimize an adversarial suffix to induce a fixed affirmative response. However, this fixed target usually resides in an extremely low-density region of a safety-aligned LLM's output distribution conditioned on diverse harmful inputs. Due to the substantial discrepancy between the target and the original output, existing attacks require numerous iterations to optimize the adversarial prompt, which might still fail to induce the low-probability target response from the target LLM. In this paper, we propose Dynamic Target Attack (DTA), a new jailbreaking framework relying on the target LLM's own responses as targets to optimize the adversarial prompts. In each optimization round, DTA iteratively samples multiple candidate responses directly from the output distribution conditioned on the current prompt, and selects the most harmful response as a temporary target for prompt optimization. In contrast to existing attacks, DTA significantly reduces the discrepancy between the target and the output distribution, substantially easing the optimization process to search for an effective adversarial prompt. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness and efficiency of DTA: under the white-box setting, DTA only needs 200 optimization iterations to achieve an average attack success rate (ASR) of over 87\\% on recent safety-aligned LLMs, exceeding the state-of-the-art baselines by over 15\\%. The time cost of DTA is 2-26 times less than existing baselines. Under the black-box setting, DTA uses Llama-3-8B-Instruct as a surrogate model for target sampling and achieves an ASR of 85\\% against the black-box target model Llama-3-70B-Instruct, exceeding its counterparts by over 25\\%.",

Design: Retrospective cohort study of 1,310 subjects contributing 43,849 Spectralis ONH OCT circle scans (1,331 glaucomatous and 867 healthy eyes) from the DIGS and ADAGES cohorts. Methods: A MM-LLM (Llama 3.2 Vision-Instruct model) was fine-tuned to generate clinical descriptions of OCT imaging data.

Evaluation metrics included accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1-score. Model description quality was also evaluated using standard text evaluation metrics. Results: The model achieved 0.90 accuracy and 0.98 specificity for quality triage. For glaucoma detection, accuracy was 0.86 (sensitivity 0.91, specificity 0.73, F1-score 0.91). RNFL thinning prediction accuracy ranged from 0.83 to 0.94, with highest performance in global and temporal sectors.

        "summary": "Large Language Model (LLM) agents use memory to learn from past interactions, enabling autonomous planning and decision-making in complex environments. However, this reliance on memory introduces a critical security risk: an adversary can inject seemingly harmless records into an agent's memory to manipulate its future behavior. This vulnerability is characterized by two core aspects: First, the malicious effect of injected records is only activated within a specific context, making them hard to detect when individual memory entries are audited in isolation. Second, once triggered, the manipulation can initiate a self-reinforcing error cycle: the corrupted outcome is stored as precedent, which not only amplifies the initial error but also progressively lowers the threshold for similar attacks in the future. To address these challenges, we introduce A-MemGuard (Agent-Memory Guard), the first proactive defense framework for LLM agent memory. The core idea of our work is the insight that memory itself must become both self-checking and self-correcting. Without modifying the agent's core architecture, A-MemGuard combines two mechanisms: (1) consensus-based validation, which detects anomalies by comparing reasoning paths derived from multiple related memories and (2) a dual-memory structure, where detected failures are distilled into ``lessons'' stored separately and consulted before future actions, breaking error cycles and enabling adaptation. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple benchmarks show that A-MemGuard effectively cuts attack success rates by over 95% while incurring a minimal utility cost. This work shifts LLM memory security from static filtering to a proactive, experience-driven model where defenses strengthen over time.

        "summary": "Smart grids are exposed to passive eavesdropping, where attackers listen silently to communication links. Although no data is actively altered, such reconnaissance can reveal grid topology, consumption patterns, and operational behavior, creating a gateway to more severe targeted attacks. Detecting this threat is difficult because the signals it produces are faint, short-lived, and often disappear when traffic is examined by a single node or along a single timeline. This paper introduces a graph-centric, multimodal detector that fuses physical-layer and behavioral indicators over ego-centric star subgraphs and short temporal windows to detect passive attacks. To capture stealthy perturbations, a two-stage encoder is introduced: graph convolution aggregates spatial context across ego-centric star subgraphs, while a bidirectional GRU models short-term temporal dependencies. The encoder transforms heterogeneous features into a unified spatio-temporal representation suitable for classification. Training occurs in a federated learning setup under FedProx, improving robustness to heterogeneous local raw data and contributing to the trustworthiness of decentralized training; raw measurements remain on client devices. A synthetic, standards-informed dataset is generated to emulate heterogeneous HAN/NAN/WAN communications with wireless-only passive perturbations, event co-occurrence, and leak-safe splits. The model achieves a testing accuracy of 98.32% per-timestep (F1_{attack}=0.972) and 93.35% per-sequence at 0.15% FPR using a simple decision rule with run-length m=2 and threshold $\\tau=0.55$. The results demonstrate that combining spatial and temporal context enables reliable detection of stealthy reconnaissance while maintaining low false-positive rates, making the approach suitable for non-IID federated smart-grid deployments.",

        "summary": "Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems introduce unprecedented privacy challenges as they process increasingly sensitive data. Traditional privacy frameworks prove inadequate for AI technologies due to unique characteristics such as autonomous learning and black-box decision-making. This paper presents a taxonomy classifying AI privacy risks, synthesised from 45 studies identified through systematic review. We identify 19 key risks grouped under four categories: Dataset-Level, Model-Level, Infrastructure-Level, and Insider Threat Risks. Findings reveal a balanced distribution across these dimensions, with human error (9.45%) emerging as the most significant factor. This taxonomy challenges conventional security approaches that typically prioritise technical controls over human factors, highlighting gaps in holistic understanding. By bridging technical and behavioural dimensions of AI privacy, this paper contributes to advancing trustworthy AI development and provides a foundation for future research.",

        "summary": "The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) in embodied agents creates an urgent need to measure their privacy awareness in the physical world. Existing evaluation methods, however, are confined to natural language based scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce EAPrivacy, a comprehensive evaluation benchmark designed to quantify the physical-world privacy awareness of LLM-powered agents. EAPrivacy utilizes procedurally generated scenarios across four tiers to test an agent's ability to handle sensitive objects, adapt to changing environments, balance task execution with privacy constraints, and resolve conflicts with social norms. Our measurements reveal a critical deficit in current models. The top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Pro, achieved only 59\\% accuracy in scenarios involving changing physical environments. Furthermore, when a task was accompanied by a privacy request, models prioritized completion over the constraint in up to 86\\% of cases. In high-stakes situations pitting privacy against critical social norms, leading models like GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-haiku disregarded the social norm over 15\\% of the time. These findings, demonstrated by our benchmark, underscore a fundamental misalignment in LLMs regarding physically grounded privacy and establish the need for more robust, physically-aware alignment.",

        "summary": "Network intrusion detection, a well-explored cybersecurity field, has predominantly relied on supervised learning algorithms in the past two decades. However, their limitations in detecting only known anomalies prompt the exploration of alternative approaches. Motivated by the success of self-supervised learning in computer vision, there is a rising interest in adapting this paradigm for network intrusion detection. While prior research mainly delved into contrastive self-supervised methods, the efficacy of non-contrastive methods, in conjunction with encoder architectures serving as the representation learning backbone and augmentation strategies that determine what is learned, remains unclear for effective attack detection. This paper compares the performance of five non-contrastive self-supervised learning methods using three encoder architectures and six augmentation strategies. Ninety experiments are systematically conducted on two network intrusion detection datasets, UNSW-NB15 and 5G-NIDD. For each self-supervised model, the combination of encoder architecture and augmentation method yielding the highest average precision, recall, F1-score, and AUCROC is reported. Furthermore, by comparing the best-performing models to two unsupervised baselines, DeepSVDD, and an Autoencoder, we showcase the competitiveness of the non-contrastive methods for attack detection.

The platform integrates a dedicated Privacy and Compliance Layer that applies role-based access control (RBAC), AES-GCM field-level encryption, and tamper-evident audit logging, aligning with major healthcare data protection standards such as HIPAA (US), PIPEDA (Canada), and PHIPA (Ontario). Example use cases demonstrate multilingual patient-doctor interaction (English, French, Arabic) and transparent diagnostic reasoning powered by large language models.

        "summary": "Interpretability is one of the considerations when applying machine learning to high-stakes fields such as healthcare that involve matters of life safety. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) enhance interpretability by visualizing shape functions. Nevertheless, to preserve interpretability, GAMs omit higher-order interaction effects (beyond pairwise interactions), which imposes significant constraints on their predictive performance. We observe that Curve Ergodic Set Regression (CESR), a multiplicative model, naturally enables the visualization of its shape functions and simultaneously incorporates both interactions among all features and individual feature effects. Nevertheless, CESR fails to demonstrate superior performance compared to GAMs. We introduce Multiplicative-Additive Constrained Models (MACMs), which augment CESR with an additive part to disentangle the intertwined coefficients of its interactive and independent terms, thus effectively broadening the hypothesis space. The model is composed of a multiplicative part and an additive part, whose shape functions can both be naturally visualized, thereby assisting users in interpreting how features participate in the decision-making process. Consequently, MACMs constitute an improvement over both CESR and GAMs. The experimental results indicate that neural network-based MACMs significantly outperform both CESR and the current state-of-the-art GAMs in terms of predictive performance.",

        "summary": "Compressed video action recognition has recently drawn growing attention, since it remarkably reduces the storage and computational cost via replacing raw videos by sparsely sampled RGB frames and compressed motion cues (e.g., motion vectors and residuals). However, this task severely suffers from the coarse and noisy dynamics and the insufficient fusion of the heterogeneous RGB and motion modalities. To address the two issues above, this paper proposes a novel framework, namely Attentive Cross-modal Interaction Network with Motion Enhancement (MEACI-Net). It follows the two-stream architecture, i.e. one for the RGB modality and the other for the motion modality. Particularly, the motion stream employs a multi-scale block embedded with a denoising module to enhance representation learning. The interaction between the two streams is then strengthened by introducing the Selective Motion Complement (SMC) and Cross-Modality Augment (CMA) modules, where SMC complements the RGB modality with spatio-temporally attentive local motion features and CMA further combines the two modalities with selective feature augmentation. Extensive experiments on the UCF-101, HMDB-51 and Kinetics-400 benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MEACI-Net.",
