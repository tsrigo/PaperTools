        "summary": "This paper studies networked multi-agent reinforcement learning (NMARL) with interdependent rewards and coupled policies. In this setting, each agent's reward depends on its own state-action pair as well as those of its direct neighbors, and each agent's policy is parameterized by its local parameters together with those of its $κ_{p}$-hop neighbors, with $κ_{p}\\geq 1$ denoting the coupled radius. The objective of the agents is to collaboratively optimize their policies to maximize the discounted average cumulative reward. To address the challenge of interdependent policies in collaborative optimization, we introduce a novel concept termed the neighbors' averaged $Q$-function and derive a new expression for the coupled policy gradient. Based on these theoretical foundations, we develop a distributed scalable coupled policy (DSCP) algorithm, where each agent relies only on the state-action pairs of its $κ_{p}$-hop neighbors and the rewards its their $(κ_{p}+1)$-hop neighbors. Specially, in the DSCP algorithm, we employ a geometric 2-horizon sampling method that does not require storing a full $Q$-table to obtain an unbiased estimate of the coupled policy gradient. Moreover, each agent interacts exclusively with its direct neighbors to obtain accurate policy parameters, while maintaining local estimates of other agents' parameters to execute its local policy and collect samples for optimization. These estimates and policy parameters are updated via a push-sum protocol, enabling distributed coordination of policy updates across the network. We prove that the joint policy produced by the proposed algorithm converges to a first-order stationary point of the objective function. Finally, the effectiveness of DSCP algorithm is demonstrated through simulations in a robot path planning environment, showing clear improvement over state-of-the-art methods.",

        "summary": "AI agents powered by large language models are increasingly deployed as cloud services that autonomously access sensitive data, invoke external tools, and interact with other agents. However, these agents run within a complex multi-party ecosystem, where untrusted components can lead to data leakage, tampering, or unintended behavior. Existing Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) provide only per binary protection and offer no guarantees for cross-principal trust, accelerator-level isolation, or supervised agent behavior. We present Omega, a system that enables trusted AI agents by enforcing end-to-end isolation, establishing verifiable trust across all contributing principals, and supervising every external interaction with accountable provenance. Omega builds on Confidential VMs and Confidential GPUs to create a Trusted Agent Platform that hosts many agents within a single CVM using nested isolation. It also provides efficient multi-agent orchestration with cross-principal trust establishment via differential attestation, and a policy specification and enforcement framework that governs data access, tool usage, and inter-agent communication for data protection and regulatory compliance. Implemented on AMD SEV-SNP and NVIDIA H100, Omega fully secures agent state across CVM-GPU, and achieves high performance while enabling high-density, policy-compliant multi-agent deployments at cloud scale.",

        "summary": "The Price of Anarchy (PoA) is a standard metric for quantifying inefficiency in socio-technical systems, widely used to guide policies like traffic tolling. Conventional PoA analysis relies on exact numerical costs. However, in many settings, costs represent agents' preferences and may be defined only up to possibly arbitrary scaling and shifting, representing informational and modeling ambiguities. We observe that while such transformations preserve equilibrium and optimal outcomes, they change the PoA value. To resolve this issue, we rely on results from Social Choice Theory and define the Invariant PoA. By connecting admissible transformations to degrees of comparability of agents' costs, we derive the specific social welfare functions which ensure that efficiency evaluations do not depend on arbitrary rescalings or translations of individual costs. Case studies on a toy example and the Zurich network demonstrate that identical tolling strategies can lead to substantially different efficiency estimates depending on the assumed comparability. Our framework thus demonstrates that explicit axiomatic foundations are necessary in order to define efficiency metrics and to appropriately guide policy in large-scale infrastructure design robustly and effectively.",

While dynamic games provide a natural modeling framework, computing Nash equilibria (NEs) in large-scale settings remains challenging, and existing mean-field game approximations rely on restrictive assumptions that fail to capture collision avoidance and heterogeneous behaviors. This paper proposes an $α$-potential game framework for decentralized CAV control. We show that computing $α$-NE reduces to solving a decentralized control problem, and derive tight bounds of the parameter $α$ based on interaction intensity and asymmetry. We further develop scalable policy gradient algorithms for computing $α$-NEs using decentralized neural-network policies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework accommodates diverse traffic flow models and effectively captures collision avoidance, obstacle avoidance, and agent heterogeneity.",

While substantial progress has been devoted to human behavior prediction, limited attention has been paid to how humans perceive, interpret, and trust robots' inferences, impeding deployment in safety-critical and socially embedded environments. This paper presents XR-DT, an eXtended Reality-enhanced Digital Twin framework for agentic mobile robots, that bridges physical and virtual spaces to enable bi-directional understanding between humans and robots. Our hierarchical XR-DT architecture integrates virtual-, augmented-, and mixed-reality layers, fusing real-time sensor data, simulated environments in the Unity game engine, and human feedback captured through wearable AR devices. Within this framework, we design an agentic mobile robot system with a unified diffusion policy for context-aware task adaptation. We further propose a chain-of-thought prompting mechanism that allows multimodal large language models to reason over human instructions and environmental context, while leveraging an AutoGen-based multi-agent coordination layer to enhance robustness and collaboration in dynamic tasks. Initial experimental results demonstrate accurate human and robot trajectory prediction, validating the XR-DT framework's effectiveness in HRI tasks. By embedding human intention, environmental dynamics, and robot cognition into the XR-DT framework, our system enables interpretable, trustworthy, and adaptive HRI.",

        "summary": "Virtual Network Embedding (VNE) is a key enabler of network slicing, yet most formulations assume that each Virtual Network Request (VNR) has a fixed topology. Recently, VNE with Alternative topologies (VNEAP) was introduced to capture malleable VNRs, where each request can be instantiated using one of several functionally equivalent topologies that trade resources differently. While this flexibility enlarges the feasible space, it also introduces an additional decision layer, making dynamic embedding more challenging. This paper proposes HRL-VNEAP, a hierarchical reinforcement learning approach for VNEAP under dynamic arrivals. A high-level policy selects the most suitable alternative topology (or rejects the request), and a low-level policy embeds the chosen topology onto the substrate network. Experiments on realistic substrate topologies under multiple traffic loads show that naive exploitation strategies provide only modest gains, whereas HRL-VNEAP consistently achieves the best performance across all metrics. Compared to the strongest tested baselines, HRL-VNEAP improves acceptance ratio by up to \\textbf{20.7\\%}, total revenue by up to \\textbf{36.2\\%}, and revenue-over-cost by up to \\textbf{22.1\\%}. Finally, we benchmark against an MILP formulation on tractable instances to quantify the remaining gap to optimality and motivate future work on learning- and optimization-based VNEAP solutions.",

We introduce M4-RAG, a massive-scale benchmark covering 42 languages and 56 regional dialects and registers, comprising over 80,000 culturally diverse image-question pairs for evaluating retrieval-augmented VQA across languages and modalities. To balance realism with reproducibility, we build a controlled retrieval environment containing millions of carefully curated multilingual documents relevant to the query domains, approximating real-world retrieval conditions while ensuring consistent experimentation. Our systematic evaluation reveals that although RAG consistently benefits smaller VLMs, it fails to scale to larger models and often even degrades their performance, exposing a critical mismatch between model size and current retrieval effectiveness. M4-RAG provides a foundation for advancing next-generation RAG systems capable of reasoning seamlessly across languages, modalities, and cultural contexts.",

In this paper, we present a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) based medical QA system that combines domain-specific knowledge retrieval with open-source LLMs to answer medical questions. We fine-tune two state-of-the-art open LLMs (LLaMA~2 and Falcon) using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for efficient domain specialization. The system retrieves relevant medical literature to ground the LLM's answers, thereby improving factual correctness and reducing hallucinations. We evaluate the approach on benchmark datasets (PubMedQA and MedMCQA) and show that retrieval augmentation yields measurable improvements in answer accuracy compared to using LLMs alone. Our fine-tuned LLaMA~2 model achieves 71.8% accuracy on PubMedQA, substantially improving over the 55.4% zero-shot baseline, while maintaining transparency by providing source references. We also detail the system design and fine-tuning methodology, demonstrating that grounding answers in retrieved evidence reduces unsupported content by approximately 60%. These results highlight the potential of RAG-augmented open-source LLMs for reliable biomedical QA, pointing toward practical clinical informatics applications.",

We tested three approaches: -In-Domain Experts: Assigning the model an expert persona (\"you are a physics expert\") matched to the problem type (physics problems) had no significant impact on performance (with the exception of the Gemini 2.0 Flash model). -Off-Domain Experts (Domain-Mismatched): Assigning the model an expert persona (\"you are a physics expert\") not matched to the problem type (law problems) resulted in marginal differences. -Low-Knowledge Personas: We assigned the model negative capability personas (layperson, young child, toddler), which were generally harmful to benchmark accuracy. Across both benchmarks, persona prompts generally did not improve accuracy relative to a no-persona baseline. Expert personas showed no consistent benefit across models, with few exceptions. Domain-mismatched expert personas sometimes degraded performance. Low-knowledge personas often reduced accuracy. These results are about the accuracy of answers only; personas may serve other purposes (such as altering the tone of outputs), beyond improving factual performance.",

Using the ConvoKit Supreme Court Corpus (2010-2019), we analyze 12,663 speech chunks from advocate-justice interactions to assess whether interruptions alter the meaning of an advocate's argument and whether interruptions toward female advocates exhibit more negative emotional valence. Semantic shifts are quantified using GloVe-based sentence embeddings, while sentiment is measured through lexicon-based analysis. We find that semantic similarity between pre- and post-interruption speech remains consistently high, suggesting that interruptions do not substantially alter argumentative content. However, interruptions directed at female advocates contain significantly higher levels of negative sentiment. These results deepen empirical understanding of gendered communication in elite institutional settings and demonstrate the value of computational linguistic methods for studying power, discourse, and equity in judicial proceedings.",

Existing methods often rely on shallow cues (e.g., names or topics) to simulate authorial style, without robust evaluation. In this work, we present a training framework for style-conditioned story generation using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and a custom multi-reward setup. The style reward is derived from a fine-tuned sentence transformer using authorship verification (AV) signals, combined with content and completeness scores to stabilize long-form narrative generation. We conduct experiments using fiction by Mark Twain, a prominent 19th-century American author, with The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn serving as the reference style exemplar. Our 8B model outperforms larger baselines such as GPT-4o and Claude Sonnet 4 in AV-style metrics, achieving a style score of 0.628 and competitive content quality. Results demonstrate the feasibility of agentic stylistic generation with moderate model size and task-specific training.

However, its broader applicability and efficiency benefits beyond a single domain have not yet been systematically explored. In this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation of CICLe across diverse NLP classification benchmarks. The results show that CICLe consistently improves over its base classifier and outperforms few-shot prompting baselines when the sample size is sufficient for training the base classifier, and performs comparably in low-data regimes. In terms of efficiency, CICLe reduces the number of shots and prompt length by up to 34.45% and 25.16%, respectively, and enables the use of smaller models with competitive performance. CICLe is furthermore particularly advantageous for text classification tasks with high class imbalance.

Based on ClinEdu, we construct ClinTeach, a large Socratic teaching dialogue dataset that captures the complexities of group instruction. We then train MedTutor-R1, the first multimodal Socratic tutor designed for one-to-many instruction in clinical medical education. MedTutor-R1 is first instruction-tuned on our ClinTeach dataset and then optimized with reinforcement learning, using rewards derived from a three-axis rubric, covering structural fidelity, analytical quality, and clinical safety, to refine its adaptive Socratic strategies. For authentic in-situ assessment, we use simulation-based interactive evaluation that redeploys the tutor back into ClinEdu. Experimental results demonstrate that our MedTutor-R1 outperforms the base model by over 20% in average pedagogical score and is comparable to o3, while also exhibiting high adaptability in handling a varying number of students.

We introduce Interleaved Latent Visual Reasoning (ILVR), a framework that unifies dynamic state evolution with precise perceptual modeling. ILVR interleaves textual generation with latent visual representations that act as specific, evolving cues for subsequent reasoning. To enable this, we employ a self-supervision strategy where a Momentum Teacher Model selectively distills relevant features from helper images into sparse supervision targets. This adaptive selection mechanism guides the model to autonomously generate context-aware visual signals. Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that ILVR significantly outperforms existing approaches, effectively bridging the gap between fine-grained perception and sequential multimodal reasoning.",

Existing approaches are largely English-focused and primarily rely on distillation from general-purpose LLMs, raising concerns about the reliability of their medical knowledge. In this work, we present a method to generate multilingual reasoning traces grounded in factual medical knowledge. We produce 500k traces in English, Italian, and Spanish, using a retrievalaugmented generation approach over medical information from Wikipedia. The traces are generated to solve medical questions drawn from MedQA and MedMCQA, which we extend to Italian and Spanish. We test our pipeline in both in-domain and outof-domain settings across Medical QA benchmarks, and demonstrate that our reasoning traces improve performance both when utilized via in-context learning (few-shot) and supervised fine-tuning, yielding state-of-the-art results among 8B-parameter LLMs. We believe that these resources can support the development of safer, more transparent clinical decision-support tools in multilingual settings. We release the full suite of resources: reasoning traces, translated QA datasets, Medical-Wikipedia, and fine-tuned models.",

This evaluation demonstrates the potential of large-scale public-sector corpora to support advanced information access and transparency through structured retrieval and reasoning over governmental documents, and highlights how such a RAG pipeline could simulate a chat-based assistant capable of interactively answering questions about public decisions. Due to its scale, quality, and domain coverage, the corpus can also serve as high-value pre-training or fine-tuning material for new Language Models (LMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) respectively, including specialized models for legal and governmental domains, and as a foundation for novel approaches in domain adaptation, knowledge-grounded generation, and explainable AI.

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has shown promise, its linear structure often propagates errors, limiting overall effectiveness. To address this limitation, we present the a systematic study of Tree-of-Thought (ToT) reasoning for Bengali MWPs using the SOMADHAN dataset. Owing to computational and token-cost constraints, we evaluate a curated set of 100 representative problems across multiple large language models (LLMs), including GPT-OSS and LLaMA variants, under standard prompting, CoT, and ToT strategies. Our results show that CoT improves baseline accuracy from 78% (standard prompting) to 83% on average, while ToT further increases performance by up to 5 percentage points, achieving 88% accuracy with GPT-OSS-120B. These improvements highlight that ToT is particularly effective in medium-to-large-scale models but may offer less advantage for smaller ones. Overall, our findings establish ToT as a robust framework for solving mathematical problems in low-resource languages such as Bengali. More broadly, this study shows that structured reasoning methods like ToT can provide more reliable and globally consistent outcomes than CoT, paving the way for better reasoning strategies in multilingual NLP.",

        "summary": "Objective: To evaluate large language models (LLMs) against supervised baselines for fine-grained, lesion-level detection of incidentalomas requiring follow-up, addressing the limitations of current document-level classification systems. Methods: We utilized a dataset of 400 annotated radiology reports containing 1,623 verified lesion findings. We compared three supervised transformer-based encoders (BioClinicalModernBERT, ModernBERT, Clinical Longformer) against four generative LLM configurations (Llama 3.1-8B, GPT-4o, GPT-OSS-20b). We introduced a novel inference strategy using lesion-tagged inputs and anatomy-aware prompting to ground model reasoning. Performance was evaluated using class-specific F1-scores. Results: The anatomy-informed GPT-OSS-20b model achieved the highest performance, yielding an incidentaloma-positive macro-F1 of 0.79. This surpassed all supervised baselines (maximum macro-F1: 0.70) and closely matched the inter-annotator agreement of 0.76. Explicit anatomical grounding yielded statistically significant performance gains across GPT-based models (p < 0.05), while a majority-vote ensemble of the top systems further improved the macro-F1 to 0.90. Error analysis revealed that anatomy-aware LLMs demonstrated superior contextual reasoning in distinguishing actionable findings from benign lesions. Conclusion: Generative LLMs, when enhanced with structured lesion tagging and anatomical context, significantly outperform traditional supervised encoders and achieve performance comparable to human experts. This approach offers a reliable, interpretable pathway for automated incidental finding surveillance in radiology workflows.",

However, as AI systems progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and Artificial Superintelligence (ASI), such value systems may become insufficient. In addition, human feedback-based alignment remains resource-intensive and difficult to scale. While AI-feedback-based self-improving alignment methods have been explored as a scalable alternative, they have largely remained constrained to conventional alignment values. In this work, we explore both a more holistic alignment objective and a scalable, self-improving alignment approach. Aiming to transcend conventional alignment norms, we introduce Collective Agency (CA)-a unified and open-ended alignment value that encourages integrated agentic capabilities. We also propose Dynamic Alignment-an alignment framework that enables an LLM to iteratively align itself. Dynamic Alignment comprises two key components: (1) automated training dataset generation with LLMs, and (2) a self-rewarding mechanism, where the policy model evaluates its own output candidates and assigns rewards for GRPO-based learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach successfully aligns the model to CA while preserving general NLP capabilities.",

Experiments show that RAG markedly improves factual accuracy; open-source models gain up to +56.8 percentage points (for example, Qwen3 8B improves from 35.0 to 91.8), approaching proprietary model performance. RAG-style fine-tuning further boosts both factual recall and contextual reasoning, improving results on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks. MusWikiDB also yields approximately 6 percentage points higher accuracy and 40% faster retrieval than a general-purpose Wikipedia corpus.

However, existing low-bit quantization and sparsification techniques are difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency due to the limited hardware support. For example, W4A8 can only achieve the same peak TOPS as W8A8 whereas the GPU-supported sparse data format (2:4 semi-structure sparse) is seldomly adopted due to the loss of accuracy. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we propose the Sparse-Quantized Format (SQ-format), which is a unified data format for quantization and sparsification potentially easily supported by new hardware and existing GPUs. SQ-format makes use of the fact that sparse matrix can be accelerated in high-precision, and low-precision matrix multiplication can also be accelerated accordingly. As such, SQ-format is proposed to achieve Pareto improvement between performance and throughput. This format is particularly suitable for activations with outlier inequality status and makes their static compression possible. We show the state-of-the-art PTQ performance with SQ-format, propose the hardware required to support it, and further offer the design exploration and insights for the next-generation AI accelerators.",

However, these approaches either require additional test-time compute or assume access to more powerful teacher models, making them costly and less practical. In this work, we propose Self Critique and Refinement-based Preference Optimization (SCRPO), which is a self-supervised training framework that first constructs a preference dataset by leveraging the LLM's own critique and refinement capabilities, and then applies preference learning to improve the same LLM for faithful summarization. Experiments on three summarization benchmarks (XSUM CNNDM and SAMSum), demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art self-supervised learning methods in terms of faithfulness metrics while either maintaining or improving other metrics that measure the overall quality of the summary.

        "summary": "Language models (LMs) judges are widely used to evaluate the quality of LM outputs. Despite many advantages, LM judges display concerning biases that can impair their integrity in evaluations. One such bias is self-preference: LM judges preferring their own answers over those produced by other LMs or humans. The bias is hard to eliminate as frontier LM judges can distinguish their own outputs from those of others, even when the evaluation candidates are not labeled with their sources. In this paper, we investigate strategies to mitigate self-preference by reducing the LM judges' ability to recognize their own outputs. We apply black-box perturbations to evaluation candidates in pairwise comparison to obfuscate the authorship and reduce self-recognition. We find that perturbations as simple as synonym replacement for a few words predictably reduce self-preference. However, we also uncover fundamental challenges to eliminating the bias: when we extrapolate our perturbations to a more complete neutralization of stylistic differences between the evaluation candidates, self-preference recovers. Our findings suggest that self-recognition and self-preference can happen on many semantic levels, and complete mitigation remains challenging despite promising initial results.",

We challenge the naive assumption that linguistic change is simplification by quantitatively analyzing over 2,000 years of Sanskrit, demonstrating how weakly-supervised hybrid methods can yield new insights into the evolution of morphologically rich, low-resource languages. Our approach addresses data scarcity through weak supervision, using 100+ high-precision regex patterns to generate pseudo-labels for fine-tuning a multilingual BERT. We then fuse symbolic and neural outputs via a novel confidence-weighted ensemble, creating a system that is both scalable and interpretable. Applying this framework to a 1.47-million-word diachronic corpus, our ensemble achieves a 52.4% overall feature detection rate. Our findings reveal that Sanskrit's overall morphological complexity does not decrease but is instead dynamically redistributed: while earlier verbal features show cyclical patterns of decline, complexity shifts to other domains, evidenced by a dramatic expansion in compounding and the emergence of new philosophical terminology. Critically, our system produces well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, with confidence strongly correlating with accuracy (Pearson r = 0.92) and low overall calibration error (ECE = 0.043), bolstering the reliability of these findings for computational philology.",

        "summary": "Large reasoning models achieve strong performance on complex tasks by generating extended chains of thought, but they often \"overthink\": continuing to reason long after they have enough information to answer correctly. This wastes inference-time compute and can hurt accuracy. Existing attempts to stop early either manipulate decoding with extra sampling and heuristics, rely on auxiliary verifier models, or operate only as post-hoc analysis pipelines without formal guarantees. We introduce LYNX, an online early-exit mechanism that turns a model's own hidden-state awareness into confidence-controlled stopping decisions. LYNX attaches exit decisions to naturally occurring reasoning cues (e.g., \"hmm\", \"wait\") during generation, trains a lightweight probe on hidden states at those cue tokens using supervision from forced exits, and wraps the resulting scores in split conformal prediction to obtain distribution-free control over premature exits. Crucially, we train and calibrate this probe once on a generic mathematical corpus and reuse it unchanged across benchmarks, decoding temperatures, and even non-mathematical tasks. Across three model families spanning 1.5B to 32B parameters, a single mathematically trained probe per base model yields strong accuracy--efficiency tradeoffs. On GSM8K, LYNX matches or improves baseline accuracy while reducing tokens by 40--65\\%; on MATH-500 it improves accuracy by up to 12 points with roughly 35--60\\% fewer tokens; on AIME 2024 it recovers baseline accuracy with more than 50\\% token savings; and on CommonsenseQA, a non-math benchmark, it transfers zero-shot with modest accuracy gains and up to 70\\% fewer tokens. Compared to state-of-the-art early-exit methods, LYNX offers competitive or superior Pareto frontiers while remaining fully online, requiring no proxy models at inference, and providing explicit, user-tunable confidence guarantees.",

Clinical notes for patients' assessments, diagnoses, and treatments are captured in these EHRs in free-form text by physicians, who spend a considerable amount of time entering and editing them. Manually writing clinical notes takes a considerable amount of a doctor's valuable time, increasing the patient's waiting time and possibly delaying diagnoses. Large language models (LLMs) possess the ability to generate news articles that closely resemble human-written ones. We investigate the usage of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompt engineering to improve the LLM's response in clinical note generation. In our prompts, we use as input International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes and basic patient information. We investigate a strategy that combines the traditional CoT with semantic search results to improve the quality of generated clinical notes. Additionally, we infuse a knowledge graph (KG) built from clinical ontology to further enrich the domain-specific knowledge of generated clinical notes. We test our prompting technique on six clinical cases from the CodiEsp test dataset using GPT-4 and our results show that it outperformed the clinical notes generated by standard one-shot prompts.",

        "summary": "In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architectures are gaining significant attention for their ability to ground language generation in reliable knowledge sources. Despite their impressive effectiveness in many areas, RAG systems based solely on semantic similarity often fail to ensure factual accuracy in specialized domains, where terminological ambiguity can affect retrieval relevance. This study proposes an enhanced RAG architecture that integrates a factual signal derived from Entity Linking to improve the accuracy of educational question-answering systems in Italian. The system includes a Wikidata-based Entity Linking module and implements three re-ranking strategies to combine semantic and entity-based information: a hybrid score weighting model, reciprocal rank fusion, and a cross-encoder re-ranker. Experiments were conducted on two benchmarks: a custom academic dataset and the standard SQuAD-it dataset. Results show that, in domain-specific contexts, the hybrid schema based on reciprocal rank fusion significantly outperforms both the baseline and the cross-encoder approach, while the cross-encoder achieves the best results on the general-domain dataset. These findings confirm the presence of an effect of domain mismatch and highlight the importance of domain adaptation and hybrid ranking strategies to enhance factual precision and reliability in retrieval-augmented generation. They also demonstrate the potential of entity-aware RAG systems in educational environments, fostering adaptive and reliable AI-based tutoring tools.",

By characterizing four key properties of zoom (i.e., pre-zoom, depth, shrink size, minimal crop size), we unlock its full capabilities for dynamic spatial focusing and adaptive context switching. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly boosts the performance of both general vision-language and specialized GUI grounding models, achieving state-of-the-art results on several mainstream benchmarks; for example, UI-Venus-72B attains a 73.1% success rate on ScreenSpot-Pro. Furthermore, we present GUIZoom-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating model adaptability to zoom, aiming to inspire future research on improving zoom for further training and test-time scaling in GUI grounding tasks.",

        "summary": "How many mistakes do published AI papers contain? Peer-reviewed publications form the foundation upon which new research and knowledge are built. Errors that persist in the literature can propagate unnoticed, creating confusion in follow-up studies and complicating reproducibility. The accelerating pace of research and the increasing demands on the peer-review system make such mistakes harder to detect and avoid. To address this, we developed a Paper Correctness Checker based on GPT-5 to systematically identify mistakes in papers previously published at top AI conferences and journals. Our analysis focuses on objective mistakes-e.g., errors in formulas, derivations, calculations, figures, and tables-that have a clearly verifiable ground truth. We intentionally exclude subjective considerations such as novelty, importance, or writing quality. We find that published papers contain a non-negligible number of objective mistakes and that the average number of mistakes per paper has increased over time-from 3.8 in NeurIPS 2021 to 5.9 in NeurIPS 2025 (55.3% increase); from 4.1 in ICLR 2018 to 5.2 in ICLR 2025; and from 5.0 in TMLR 2022/23 to 5.5 in TMLR 2025. Human experts reviewed 316 potential mistakes identified by the AI Checker and confirmed that 263 were actual mistakes, corresponding to a precision of 83.2%. While most identified issues are relatively minor, correcting them would reduce confusion in the literature and strengthen reproducibility. The AI Checker also surfaced potentially more substantive mistakes that could affect the interpretation of results. Moreover, we show that the AI Checker can propose correct fixes for 75.8% of the identified mistakes. Overall, this study highlights the potential of frontier LLMs to detect and correct objective mistakes in published papers, helping to establish a firmer foundation of knowledge.",

We propose reframing this as a natural language reasoning task by transforming codebases into hierarchical NL summaries and performing NL-to-NL search instead of cross-modal retrieval. Our approach builds context-aware summaries at file, directory, and repository levels, then uses a two-phase search: first routing bug reports to relevant repositories, then performing top-down localization within those repositories. Evaluated on DNext, an industrial system with 46 repositories and 1.1M lines of code, our method achieves Pass@10 of 0.82 and MRR of 0.50, significantly outperforming retrieval baselines and agentic RAG systems like GitHub Copilot and Cursor. This work demonstrates that engineered natural language representations can be more effective than raw source code for scalable bug localization, providing an interpretable repository -> directory -> file search path, which is vital for building trust in enterprise AI tools by providing essential transparency.",

        "summary": "Long video understanding (LVU) is challenging because answering real-world queries often depends on sparse, temporally dispersed cues buried in hours of mostly redundant and irrelevant content. While agentic pipelines improve video reasoning capabilities, prevailing frameworks rely on a query-agnostic captioner to perceive video information, which wastes computation on irrelevant content and blurs fine-grained temporal and spatial information. Motivated by active perception theory, we argue that LVU agents should actively decide what, when, and where to observe, and continuously assess whether the current observation is sufficient to answer the query. We present Active Video Perception (AVP), an evidence-seeking framework that treats the video as an interactive environment and acquires compact, queryrelevant evidence directly from pixels. Concretely, AVP runs an iterative plan-observe-reflect process with MLLM agents. In each round, a planner proposes targeted video interactions, an observer executes them to extract time-stamped evidence, and a reflector evaluates the sufficiency of the evidence for the query, either halting with an answer or triggering further observation. Across five LVU benchmarks, AVP achieves highest performance with significant improvements. Notably, AVP outperforms the best agentic method by 5.7% in average accuracy while only requires 18.4% inference time and 12.4% input tokens.",

        "summary": "Over the past four decades, artificial intelligence (AI) research has flourished at the nexus of academia and industry. However, Big Tech companies have increasingly acquired the edge in computational resources, big data, and talent. So far, it has been largely unclear how many papers the industry funds, how their citation impact compares to non-funded papers, and what drives industry interest. This study fills that gap by quantifying the number of industry-funded papers at 10 top AI conferences (e.g., ICLR, CVPR, AAAI, ACL) and their citation influence. We analyze about 49.8K papers, about 1.8M citations from AI papers to other papers, and about 2.3M citations from other papers to AI papers from 1998-2022 in Scopus. Through seven research questions, we examine the volume and evolution of industry funding in AI research, the citation impact of funded papers, the diversity and temporal range of their citations, and the subfields in which industry predominantly acts. Our findings reveal that industry presence has grown markedly since 2015, from less than 2 percent to more than 11 percent in 2020. Between 2018 and 2022, 12 percent of industry-funded papers achieved high citation rates as measured by the h5-index, compared to 4 percent of non-industry-funded papers and 2 percent of non-funded papers. Top AI conferences engage more with industry-funded research than non-funded research, as measured by our newly proposed metric, the Citation Preference Ratio (CPR). We show that industry-funded research is increasingly insular, citing predominantly other industry-funded papers while referencing fewer non-funded papers. These findings reveal new trends in AI research funding, including a shift towards more industry-funded papers and their growing citation impact, greater insularity of industry-funded work than non-funded work, and a preference of industry-funded research to cite recent work.",

        "summary": "Ontologies are an important tool for structuring domain knowledge, but their development is a complex task that requires significant modelling and domain expertise. Ontology learning, aimed at automating this process, has seen advancements in the past decade with the improvement of Natural Language Processing techniques, and especially with the recent growth of Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper investigates the challenge of identifying axioms: fundamental ontology components that define logical relations between classes and properties. In this work, we introduce an Ontology Axiom Benchmark OntoAxiom, and systematically test LLMs on that benchmark for axiom identification, evaluating different prompting strategies, ontologies, and axiom types. The benchmark consists of nine medium-sized ontologies with together 17.118 triples, and 2.771 axioms. We focus on subclass, disjoint, subproperty, domain, and range axioms. To evaluate LLM performance, we compare twelve LLMs with three shot settings and two prompting strategies: a Direct approach where we query all axioms at once, versus an Axiom-by-Axiom (AbA) approach, where each prompt queries for one axiom only. Our findings show that the AbA prompting leads to higher F1 scores than the direct approach. However, performance varies across axioms, suggesting that certain axioms are more challenging to identify. The domain also influences performance: the FOAF ontology achieves a score of 0.642 for the subclass axiom, while the music ontology reaches only 0.218. Larger LLMs outperform smaller ones, but smaller models may still be viable for resource-constrained settings. Although performance overall is not high enough to fully automate axiom identification, LLMs can provide valuable candidate axioms to support ontology engineers with the development and refinement of ontologies.",

However, the off-policy training paradigm introduces distribution shift, which often pushes the policy beyond the trust region, leading to training instabilities manifested as fluctuations in policy entropy and unstable gradients. Although PPO-Clip mitigates this issue through importance clipping, it still overlooks the global distributional shift of actions. To address these challenges, we propose using the entropy ratio between the current and previous policies as a new global metric that effectively quantifies the relative change in policy exploration throughout updates. Building on this metric, we introduce an \\textbf{Entropy Ratio Clipping} (ERC) mechanism that imposes bidirectional constraints on the entropy ratio. This stabilizes policy updates at the global distribution level and compensates for the inability of PPO-clip to regulate probability shifts of un-sampled actions. We integrate ERC into both DAPO and GPPO reinforcement learning algorithms. Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that ERC consistently improves performance.",

Although high-dimensional text can encode rich contextual information, it also poses unique challenges for causal identification and estimation. In particular, the positivity assumption, which requires sufficient treatment overlap across confounder values, is often violated at the observational level, when massive text is represented in feature spaces. Redundant or spurious textual features inflate dimensionality, producing extreme propensity scores, unstable weights, and inflated variance in effect estimates. We address these challenges with Confounding-Aware Token Rationalization (CATR), a framework that selects a sparse necessary subset of tokens using a residual-independence diagnostic designed to preserve confounding information sufficient for unconfoundedness. By discarding irrelevant texts while retaining key signals, CATR mitigates observational-level positivity violations and stabilizes downstream causal effect estimators. Experiments on synthetic data and a real-world study using the MIMIC-III database demonstrate that CATR yields more accurate, stable, and interpretable causal effect estimates than existing baselines.",

Most prior studies have treated documents as fixed units, feeding their full content directly to LLM assessors. We investigate how text summarization affects the reliability of LLM-based judgments and their downstream impact on IR evaluation. Using state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple TREC collections, we compare judgments made from full documents with those based on LLM-generated summaries of different lengths. We examine their agreement with human labels, their effect on retrieval effectiveness evaluation, and their influence on IR systems' ranking stability. Our findings show that summary-based judgments achieve comparable stability in systems' ranking to full-document judgments, while introducing systematic shifts in label distributions and biases that vary by model and dataset. These results highlight summarization as both an opportunity for more efficient large-scale IR evaluation and a methodological choice with important implications for the reliability of automatic judgments.",

To answer this question however, one must first precisely define A.G.I. We borrow prior work's definition of A.G.I. [1] that best describes the sentiment of the term, as used by the leading developers of A.I. That is, the ability to be creative and innovate in some field of study in a way that unlocks new and previously unknown functional capabilities in that field. Based on this definition we draw new bounds on the limits of computation. We formally prove that no algorithm can demonstrate new functional capabilities that were not already present in the initial algorithm itself. Therefore, no algorithm (and thus no A.I. model) can be truly creative in any field of study, whether that is science, engineering, art, sports, etc. In contrast, A.I. models can demonstrate existing functional capabilities, as well as combinations and permutations of existing functional capabilities. We conclude this work by discussing the implications of this proof both as it regards to the future of A.I. development, as well as to what it means for the origins of human intelligence.",

        "summary": "Evaluating faithfulness of Large Language Models (LLMs) to a given task is a complex challenge. We propose two new unsupervised metrics for faithfulness evaluation using insights from information theory and thermodynamics. Our approach treats an LLM as a bipartite information engine where hidden layers act as a Maxwell demon controlling transformations of context $C $ into answer $A$ via prompt $Q$. We model Question-Context-Answer (QCA) triplets as probability distributions over shared topics. Topic transformations from $C$ to $Q$ and $A$ are modeled as transition matrices ${\\bf Q}$ and ${\\bf A}$ encoding the query goal and actual result, respectively. Our semantic faithfulness (SF) metric quantifies faithfulness for any given QCA triplet by the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between these matrices. Both matrices are inferred simultaneously via convex optimization of this KL divergence, and the final SF metric is obtained by mapping the minimal divergence onto the unit interval [0,1], where higher scores indicate greater faithfulness. Furthermore, we propose a thermodynamics-based semantic entropy production (SEP) metric in answer generation, and show that high faithfulness generally implies low entropy production. The SF and SEP metrics can be used jointly or separately for LLM evaluation and hallucination control. We demonstrate our framework on LLM summarization of corporate SEC 10-K filings.",

        "summary": "In real-world scenarios, providing user queries with visually enhanced responses can considerably benefit understanding and memory, underscoring the great value of interleaved image-text generation. Despite recent progress, like the visual autoregressive model that unifies text and image processing in a single transformer architecture, generating high-quality interleaved content remains challenging. Moreover, evaluations of these interleaved sequences largely remain underexplored, with existing benchmarks often limited by unimodal metrics that inadequately assess the intricacies of combined image-text outputs. To address these issues, we present RAG-IGBench, a thorough benchmark designed specifically to evaluate the task of Interleaved Generation based on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG-IG) in open-domain question answering. RAG-IG integrates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) with retrieval mechanisms, enabling the models to access external image-text information for generating coherent multimodal content. Distinct from previous datasets, RAG-IGBench draws on the latest publicly available content from social platforms and introduces innovative evaluation metrics that measure the quality of text and images, as well as their consistency. Through extensive experiments with state-of-the-art MLLMs (both open-source and proprietary) on RAG-IGBench, we provide an in-depth analysis examining the capabilities and limitations of these models. Additionally, we validate our evaluation metrics by demonstrating their high correlation with human assessments. Models fine-tuned on RAG-IGBench's training set exhibit improved performance across multiple benchmarks, confirming both the quality and practical utility of our dataset.

We argue that this arises because RL implicitly optimizes the \"mode-seeking\" or \"zero-forcing\" Reverse KL to a target distribution causing the model to concentrate mass on certain high-probability regions of the target while neglecting others. In this work, we instead begin from an explicit target distribution, obtained by filtering out incorrect answers while preserving the relative probabilities of correct ones. Starting from a pre-trained LLM, we approximate this target distribution using the $α$-divergence family, which unifies prior approaches and enables direct control of the precision-diversity trade-off by interpolating between mode-seeking and mass-covering divergences. On a Lean theorem-proving benchmark, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance along the coverage-precision Pareto frontier, outperforming all prior methods on the coverage axis.",

MaxShapley is a special case of the celebrated Shapley value; it leverages a decomposable max-sum utility function to compute attributions with linear computation in the number of documents, as opposed to the exponential cost of Shapley values. We evaluate MaxShapley on three multi-hop QA datasets (HotPotQA, MuSiQUE, MS MARCO); MaxShapley achieves comparable attribution quality to exact Shapley computation, while consuming a fraction of its tokens--for instance, it gives up to an 8x reduction in resource consumption over prior state-of-the-art methods at the same attribution accuracy.",

        "summary": "Incomplete data are common in real-world applications. Sensors fail, records are inconsistent, and datasets collected from different sources often differ in scale, sampling rate, and quality. These differences create missing values that make it difficult to combine data and build reliable models. Standard imputation methods such as regression models, expectation-maximization, and multiple imputation rely on strong assumptions about linearity and independence. These assumptions rarely hold for complex or heterogeneous data, which can lead to biased or over-smoothed estimates. We propose Impugan, a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) for imputing missing values and integrating heterogeneous datasets. The model is trained on complete samples to learn how missing variables depend on observed ones. During inference, the generator reconstructs missing entries from available features, and the discriminator enforces realism by distinguishing true from imputed data. This adversarial process allows Impugan to capture nonlinear and multimodal relationships that conventional methods cannot represent. In experiments on benchmark datasets and a multi-source integration task, Impugan achieves up to 82\\% lower Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) and 70\\% lower mutual-information deviation (MI) compared to leading baselines. These results show that adversarially trained generative models provide a scalable and principled approach for imputing and merging incomplete, heterogeneous data.

However, large increases in computing power and the greater availability of Big Data have dramatically increased the probability of re-identifying anonymized data, potentially violating the pledge of confidentiality given to survey respondents. Data science tools can be used to produce synthetic data that preserve critical moments of the empirical data but do not contain the records of any existing individual respondent or business. Developing public-use firm data from surveys presents unique challenges different from demographic data, because there is a lack of anonymity and certain industries can be easily identified in each geographic area. This paper briefly describes a machine learning model used to construct a synthetic PUMS based on the Annual Business Survey (ABS) and discusses various quality metrics. Although the ABS PUMS is currently being refined and results are confidential, we present two synthetic PUMS developed for the 2007 Survey of Business Owners, similar to the ABS business data. Econometric replication of a high impact analysis published in Small Business Economics demonstrates the verisimilitude of the synthetic data to the true data and motivates discussion of possible ABS use cases.",

        "summary": "Deep neural networks often fail when deployed in real-world contexts due to distribution shift, a critical barrier to building safe and reliable systems. An emerging approach to address this problem relies on \\emph{disagreement discrepancy} -- a measure of how the disagreement between two models changes under a shifting distribution. The process of maximizing this measure has seen applications in bounding error under shifts, testing for harmful shifts, and training more robust models. However, this optimization involves the non-differentiable zero-one loss, necessitating the use of practical surrogate losses. We prove that existing surrogates for disagreement discrepancy are not Bayes consistent, revealing a fundamental flaw: maximizing these surrogates can fail to maximize the true disagreement discrepancy. To address this, we introduce new theoretical results providing both upper and lower bounds on the optimality gap for such surrogates. Guided by this theory, we propose a novel disagreement loss that, when paired with cross-entropy, yields a provably consistent surrogate for disagreement discrepancy. Empirical evaluations across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method provides more accurate and robust estimates of disagreement discrepancy than existing approaches, particularly under challenging adversarial conditions.",

In this work, we prove that such strategies are suboptimal for approximating the attention matrix. We introduce KQ-SVD, a simple and computationally efficient method that directly performs an optimal low-rank decomposition of the attention matrix via a closed-form solution.

Initially, the ResNet architecture was reformulated as a cyclic tridiagonal LMI, and closed-form constraints on network parameters were derived to ensure $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipschitz continuity; however, using a new $LDL^\\top$ decomposition approach for certifying LMI feasibility, we extend the construction of $\\mathcal{L}$-Lipchitz networks to any other nonlinear architecture. Our contributions include a provable parameterization methodology for constructing Lipschitz-constrained residual networks and other hierarchical architectures. Cholesky decomposition is also used for efficient parameterization. These findings enable robust network designs applicable to adversarial robustness, certified training, and control systems.

        "summary": "Traditional physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) do not always satisfy physics based constraints, especially when the constraints include differential operators. Rather, they minimize the constraint violations in a soft way. Strict satisfaction of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs) to embed domain knowledge and first-principles in data-driven models is generally challenging. This is because data-driven models consider the original functions to be black-box whose derivatives can only be obtained after evaluating the functions. We introduce DAE-HardNet, a physics-constrained (rather than simply physics-informed) neural network that learns both the functions and their derivatives simultaneously, while enforcing algebraic as well as differential constraints. This is done by projecting model predictions onto the constraint manifold using a differentiable projection layer. We apply DAE-HardNet to several systems and test problems governed by DAEs, including the dynamic Lotka-Volterra predator-prey system and transient heat conduction. We also show the ability of DAE-HardNet to estimate unknown parameters through a parameter estimation problem. Compared to multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) and PINNs, DAE-HardNet achieves orders of magnitude reduction in the physics loss while maintaining the prediction accuracy. It has the added benefits of learning the derivatives which improves the constrained learning of the backbone neural network prior to the projection layer. For specific problems, this suggests that the projection layer can be bypassed for faster inference. The current implementation and codes are available at https://github.com/SOULS-TAMU/DAE-HardNet.",

However, it remains an open question of how to best determine which of the many possible model checkpoints resulting from a large training run to use as the starting point. This becomes especially important when data for the target task of interest is scarce, unlabeled and out-of-distribution. In such scenarios, common methods relying on in-distribution validation data become unreliable or inapplicable. This work proposes a novel approach for model selection that operates reliably on just a few unlabeled examples from the target task. Our approach is based on a novel concept: Neural Coherence, which entails characterizing a model's activation statistics for source and target domains, allowing one to define model selection methods with high data-efficiency. We provide experiments where models are pre-trained on ImageNet1K and examine target domains consisting of Food-101, PlantNet-300K and iNaturalist. We also evaluate it in many meta-learning settings. Our approach significantly improves generalization across these different target domains compared to established baselines.

This work investigates the application of SNNs to high-frequency price-spike forecasting, enhancing performance via robust hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization (BO). This work converts high-frequency stock data into spike trains and evaluates three architectures: an established unsupervised STDP-trained SNN, a novel SNN with explicit inhibitory competition, and a supervised backpropagation network. BO was driven by a novel objective, Penalized Spike Accuracy (PSA), designed to ensure a network's predicted price spike rate aligns with the empirical rate of price events. Simulated trading demonstrated that models optimized with PSA consistently outperformed their Spike Accuracy (SA)-tuned counterparts and baselines. Specifically, the extended SNN model with PSA achieved the highest cumulative return (76.8%) in simple backtesting, significantly surpassing the supervised alternative (42.54% return).

        "summary": "We introduce a simple post-training method that makes transformer attention sparse without sacrificing performance. Applying a flexible sparsity regularisation under a constrained-loss objective, we show on models up to 1B parameters that it is possible to retain the original pretraining loss while reducing attention connectivity to $\\approx 0.3 \\%$ of its edges. Unlike sparse-attention methods designed for computational efficiency, our approach leverages sparsity as a structural prior: it preserves capability while exposing a more organized and interpretable connectivity pattern. We find that this local sparsity cascades into global circuit simplification: task-specific circuits involve far fewer components (attention heads and MLPs) with up to 100x fewer edges connecting them. These results demonstrate that transformer attention can be made orders of magnitude sparser, suggesting that much of its computation is redundant and that sparsity may serve as a guiding principle for more structured and interpretable models.",

        "summary": "Dataset distillation (DD) aims to construct compact synthetic datasets that allow models to achieve comparable performance to full-data training while substantially reducing storage and computation. Despite rapid empirical progress, its theoretical foundations remain limited: existing methods (gradient, distribution, trajectory matching) are built on heterogeneous surrogate objectives and optimization assumptions, which makes it difficult to analyze their common principles or provide general guarantees. Moreover, it is still unclear under what conditions distilled data can retain the effectiveness of full datasets when the training configuration, such as optimizer, architecture, or augmentation, changes. To answer these questions, we propose a unified theoretical framework, termed configuration--dynamics--error analysis, which reformulates major DD approaches under a common generalization-error perspective and provides two main results: (i) a scaling law that provides a single-configuration upper bound, characterizing how the error decreases as the distilled sample size increases and explaining the commonly observed performance saturation effect; and (ii) a coverage law showing that the required distilled sample size scales linearly with configuration diversity, with provably matching upper and lower bounds. In addition, our unified analysis reveals that various matching methods are interchangeable surrogates, reducing the same generalization error, clarifying why they can all achieve dataset distillation and providing guidance on how surrogate choices affect sample efficiency and robustness. Experiments across diverse methods and configurations empirically confirm the derived laws, advancing a theoretical foundation for DD and enabling theory-driven design of compact, configuration-robust dataset distillation.",

While classical analyses emphasize numerical stability of Jacobian products, we show that stability alone is insufficient: learnability is governed instead by the \\emph{effective learning rates} $μ_{t,\\ell}$, per-lag and per-neuron quantities obtained from first-order expansions of gate-induced Jacobian products in Backpropagation Through Time. These effective learning rates act as multiplicative filters that control both the magnitude and anisotropy of gradient transport. Under heavy-tailed ($α$-stable) gradient noise, we prove that the minimal sample size required to detect a dependency at lag~$\\ell$ satisfies $N(\\ell)\\propto f(\\ell)^{-α}$, where $f(\\ell)=\\|μ_{t,\\ell}\\|_1$ is the effective learning rate envelope. This leads to an explicit formula for $\\mathcal{H}_N$ and closed-form scaling laws for logarithmic, polynomial, and exponential decay of $f(\\ell)$. The theory predicts that broader or more heterogeneous gate spectra produce slower decay of $f(\\ell)$ and hence larger learnability windows, whereas heavier-tailed noise compresses $\\mathcal{H}_N$ by slowing statistical concentration. By linking gate-induced time-scale structure, gradient noise, and sample complexity, the framework identifies the effective learning rates as the fundamental quantities that govern when -- and for how long -- gated recurrent networks can learn long-range temporal dependencies.",

This mechanistic understanding enables three key applications. First, our models serve as post-hoc validators for CASP systems, filtering chemically implausible transformations. Second, they enable holistic atom-to-atom mapping that tracks all atoms, including hydrogens. Third, they extract catalyst-aware reaction templates that distinguish recycled catalysts from spectator species. By grounding predictions in physically meaningful electron moves that ensure conservation of mass and charge, this work provides a pathway toward more explainable and chemically valid computational synthesis planning, while providing an architecture-agnostic framework for the benchmarking of mechanism prediction.",

However, large codebooks and effects caused by reflections or blockages of beams make an optimal beam selection challenging. In contrast to previous work and standardization efforts that opt for supervised learning to train classifiers to predict the next best beam based on previously selected beams we formulate the problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and model the environment as the codebook itself. At each time step, we select a candidate beam conditioned on the belief state of the unobservable optimal beam and previously probed beams. This frames the beam selection problem as an online search procedure that locates the moving optimal beam.

While data filtering has emerged as a pretraining-time mitigation, it faces significant challenges: labeling whether data is harmful is expensive at scale, and given improving sample efficiency with larger models, even small amounts of mislabeled content could give rise to dangerous capabilities. To address risks associated with mislabeled harmful content, prior work proposed Gradient Routing (Cloud et al., 2024) -- a technique that localizes target knowledge into a dedicated subset of model parameters so they can later be removed. We explore an improved variant of Gradient Routing, which we call Selective GradienT Masking (SGTM), with particular focus on evaluating its robustness to label noise. SGTM zero-masks selected gradients such that target domain examples only update their dedicated parameters. We test SGTM's effectiveness in two applications: removing knowledge of one language from a model trained on a bilingual synthetic dataset, and removing biology knowledge from a model trained on English Wikipedia. In both cases SGTM provides better retain/forget trade-off in the presence of labeling errors compared to both data filtering and a previously proposed instantiation of Gradient Routing. Unlike shallow unlearning approaches that can be quickly undone through fine-tuning, SGTM exhibits strong robustness to adversarial fine-tuning, requiring seven times more fine-tuning steps to reach baseline performance on the forget set compared to a finetuning-based unlearning method (RMU). Our results suggest SGTM provides a promising pretraining-time complement to existing safety mitigations, particularly in settings where label noise is unavoidable.",

Given a task manifold (input space), a modular decomposition, and access to module-level representations, we estimate empirical jets, which are local linear response maps that describe how each module reacts to small structured perturbations of the input. We propose an empirical notion of \\emph{mirage} regimes, where multiple distinct modular decompositions induce indistinguishable jets and thus remain observationally equivalent, and contrast this with an \\emph{identifiable} regime, where the observed jets single out a decomposition up to natural symmetries. In the setting of two-module linear regression pipelines we prove a jet-identifiability theorem. Under mild rank assumptions and access to module-level jets, the internal factorisation is uniquely determined, whereas risk-only evaluation admits a large family of mirage decompositions that implement the same input-to-output map.

However, efforts to validate and replicate their successes have reported mixed results. To better understand the effectiveness of these optimizers at scale, in this work we investigate how to scale preconditioned optimizers via hyperparameter transfer, building on prior works such as $μ$P. We study how the optimal learning rate and weight decay should scale with model width and depth for a wide range of optimizers, including Shampoo, SOAP, and Muon, accounting for the impact of commonly used techniques such as blocking and grafting. We find that scaling the learning rate according to $μ$P improves transfer, but can still suffer from significant finite-width deviations that cause drifting optimal learning rates, which we show can be mitigated by blocking and explicit spectral normalization. For compute-optimal scaling, we find scaling independent weight decay as $1/\\mathrm{width}$ is nearly optimal across optimizers. Applying these scaling rules, we show Muon and Shampoo consistently achieve $1.4\\times$ and $1.3\\times$ speedup over AdamW for training Llama-architecture language models of sizes ranging from $190$M to $1.4$B, whereas the speedup vanishes rapidly with scale under incorrect scaling. Based on these results and further ablations, we argue that studying optimal hyperparameter transfer is essential for reliably comparing optimizers at scale given a realistic tuning budget.",

        "summary": "With the increasing complexity of black-box machine learning models and their adoption in high-stakes areas, it is critical to provide explanations for their predictions. Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanation (LIME) is a widely used technique that explains the prediction of any classifier by learning an interpretable model locally around the predicted instance. However, it assumes that the local decision boundary is linear and fails to capture the non-linear relationships, leading to incorrect explanations. In this paper, we propose a novel method that can generate high-fidelity explanations. Multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) is used to model non-linear local boundaries that effectively captures the underlying behavior of the reference model, thereby enhancing the local fidelity of the explanation. Additionally, we utilize the N-ball sampling technique, which samples directly from the desired distribution instead of reweighting samples as done in LIME, further improving the faithfulness score. We evaluate our method on three UCI datasets across different classifiers and varying kernel widths. Experimental results show that our method yields more faithful explanations compared to baselines, achieving an average reduction of 37% in root mean square error, significantly improving local fidelity.",

        "summary": "Best-of-$n$ is a widely used test-time scaling approach for LLM inference. Yet despite evidence that LLMs exhibit complementary strengths across tasks, traditionally best-of-$n$ relies on a single model to generate responses. We propose RoBoN (Routed Online Best-of-$n$), a sequential multi-LLM alternative to the prevailing single-model best-of-$n$. Given a suite of models $\\{m_i\\}_{i=1}^M$, RoBoN sequentially routes generations one-by-one across models, based on scores computed using a reward model and an agreement signal on the predicted responses. This online routing requires no additional training, keeps compute parity, and works with any plug-in reward model. Across reasoning benchmarks (MATH500, OlympiadBench, MinervaMath, GSM8K, MMLU), RoBoN consistently outperforms standard best-of-$n$ applied to each individual model for larger $n$, with gains of up to 3.4\\% in absolute accuracy, and also improves over a uniform multi-model portfolio baseline. Our results indicate that diversity across models can be exploited at inference to improve best-of-$n$ performance over any constituent model alone, providing a simple, training-free path to test-time scaling with multiple LLMs.",

        "summary": "The core problem in multi-view anomaly detection is to represent local neighborhoods of normal instances consistently across all views. Recent approaches consider a representation of local neighborhood in each view independently, and then capture the consistent neighbors across all views via a learning process. They suffer from two key issues. First, there is no guarantee that they can capture consistent neighbors well, especially when the same neighbors are in regions of varied densities in different views, resulting in inferior detection accuracy. Second, the learning process has a high computational cost of $\\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, rendering them inapplicable for large datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel method termed \\textbf{S}pherical \\textbf{C}onsistent \\textbf{N}eighborhoods \\textbf{E}nsemble (SCoNE). It has two unique features: (a) the consistent neighborhoods are represented with multi-view instances directly, requiring no intermediate representations as used in existing approaches; and (b) the neighborhoods have data-dependent properties, which lead to large neighborhoods in sparse regions and small neighborhoods in dense regions. The data-dependent properties enable local neighborhoods in different views to be represented well as consistent neighborhoods, without learning. This leads to $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ time complexity. Empirical evaluations show that SCoNE has superior detection accuracy and runs orders-of-magnitude faster in large datasets than existing approaches.",

Recent works in mechanistic interpretability have shown that neural networks represent meaningful concepts as directions in their representation spaces and often encode many concepts in superposition. Various sparse dictionary learning (SDL) methods, including sparse autoencoders, transcoders, and crosscoders, address this by training auxiliary models with sparsity constraints to disentangle these superposed concepts into interpretable features. These methods have demonstrated remarkable empirical success but have limited theoretical understanding. Existing theoretical work is limited to sparse autoencoders with tied-weight constraints, leaving the broader family of SDL methods without formal grounding. In this work, we develop the first unified theoretical framework considering SDL as one unified optimization problem. We demonstrate how diverse methods instantiate the theoretical framwork and provide rigorous analysis on the optimization landscape. We provide the first theoretical explanations for some empirically observed phenomena, including feature absorption, dead neurons, and the neuron resampling technique. We further design controlled experiments to validate our theoretical results.",

In this paper, we introduce Credal and Interval Deep Evidential Classifications (CDEC and IDEC, respectively) as novel approaches to address UQ in classification tasks. CDEC and IDEC leverage a credal set (closed and convex set of probabilities) and an interval of evidential predictive distributions, respectively, allowing us to avoid overfitting to the training data and to systematically assess both epistemic (reducible) and aleatoric (irreducible) uncertainties. When those surpass acceptable thresholds, CDEC and IDEC have the capability to abstain from classification and flag an excess of epistemic or aleatoric uncertainty, as relevant. Conversely, within acceptable uncertainty bounds, CDEC and IDEC provide a collection of labels with robust probabilistic guarantees. CDEC and IDEC are trained using standard backpropagation and a loss function that draws from the theory of evidence. They overcome the shortcomings of previous efforts, and extend the current evidential deep learning literature. Through extensive experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, together with their natural OoD shifts (F-MNIST/K-MNIST, SVHN/Intel, TinyImageNet), we show that CDEC and IDEC achieve competitive predictive accuracy, state-of-the-art OoD detection under epistemic and total uncertainty, and tight, well-calibrated prediction regions that expand reliably under distribution shift. An ablation over ensemble size further demonstrates that CDEC attains stable uncertainty estimates with only a small ensemble.",

Therefore, this paper introduces a NeuTucker decomposition model utilizing discretized data. Designed for continuous yet sparse three-dimensional wind field data, it constructs a low-rank Tucker decomposition model based on a Tucker neural network to capture the latent interactions within the three-dimensional wind field data. Therefore, two core ideas are proposed here: 1) Discretizing continuous input data to adapt to models like NeuTucF that require discrete data inputs. 2) Constructing a four-dimensional Tucker interaction tensor to represent all possible spatio-temporal interactions among different elevations and three-dimensional wind speeds. In estimating missing observations in real datasets, this discretized NeuTucF model demonstrates superior performance compared to various common regression models.",

This study examines how ensembles balance accuracy and overfitting across four tabular classification tasks: Breast Cancer, Heart Disease, Pima Diabetes, and Credit Card Fraud. Using repeated stratified cross validation with statistical significance testing, we compare linear models, a single decision tree, and nine ensemble methods. The results show that ensembles can reach high accuracy without large gaps by reducing variance through averaging or controlled boosting. On nearly linear and clean data, linear models already generalize well and ensembles offer little additional benefit. On datasets with meaningful nonlinear structure, tree based ensembles increase test accuracy by 5 to 7 points while keeping gaps below 3 percent. On noisy or highly imbalanced datasets, ensembles remain competitive but require regularization to avoid fitting noise or majority class patterns. We also compute simple dataset complexity indicators, such as linearity score, Fisher ratio, and noise estimate, which explain when ensembles are likely to control variance effectively. Overall, the study provides a clear view of how and when ensembles maintain high accuracy while keeping overfitting low, offering practical guidance for model selection in real world tabular applications.",

In response, this study highlights the advantages of non-ideal negative samples and proposes the IdealTSF framework, which integrates both ideal positive and negative samples for time series forecasting. IdealTSF consists of three progressive steps: pretraining, training, and optimization. It first pretrains the model by extracting knowledge from negative sample data, then transforms the sequence data into ideal positive samples during training. Additionally, a negative optimization mechanism with adversarial disturbances is applied. Extensive experiments demonstrate that negative sample data unlocks significant potential within the basic attention architecture for time series forecasting.

The pipeline applies type-specific preprocessing -- median imputation and standardization for numeric variables, effect coding for binary features, and mode imputation with low-dimensional embeddings for rare categorical attributes -- and initializes patient nodes with summary statistics, while retaining measurement values on edges to preserve \"who measured what and by how much\". In a retrospective, multi-center Chinese cohort (N = 648; 70/30 train--test split) drawn from three tertiary hospitals, Triplet-GCN consistently outperforms strong tabular baselines (KNN, SVM, XGBoost, Random Forest) across discrimination and balanced error metrics, yielding a more favorable sensitivity--specificity trade-off and improved overall utility for early warning.

In contrast to the original work of CorrDiff, the region considered in this work is nearly 20 times larger, and we not only consider surface variables as in the original work, but also encounter high-level variables (six pressure levels) as target downscaling variables. In addition, a global residual connection is added to improve accuracy. In order to generate the 3km forecasts for the China region, we apply our trained models to the 25km global grid forecasts of CMA-GFS, an operational global model of the China Meteorological Administration (CMA), and SFF, a data-driven deep learning-based weather model developed from Spherical Fourier Neural Operators (SFNO). CMA-MESO, a high-resolution regional model, is chosen as the baseline model. The experimental results demonstrate that the forecasts downscaled by our method generally outperform the direct forecasts of CMA-MESO in terms of MAE for the target variables. Our forecasts of radar composite reflectivity show that CorrDiff, as a generative model, can generate fine-scale details that lead to more realistic predictions compared to the corresponding deterministic regression models.",

This integration achieves effective unlearning without degrading LLM code generation capabilities. Extensive experiments show that our framework supports forget sets up to 3x larger, typically requiring only a single training epoch, while preserving both syntactic correctness and functional integrity of register-transfer level (RTL) codes.

While Shapley value based methods provide principled feature attributions, existing formulations cannot tractably evaluate higher order interactions: the Shapley Taylor Interaction Index (STII) requires exponential scale enumeration of subsets, and current tensor based approaches such as the Marginal SHAP Tensor (MST) are restricted to first order effects. The central problem is that no existing framework simultaneously preserves the axiomatic exactness of STII and avoids the exponential computational blow up inherent to high order discrete derivatives. Here we show that high order Shapley interactions can be represented exactly as tensor network contractions, enabling polynomial time and polylog depth computation under Tensor Train (TT) structure. We introduce Interaction Tensor SHAP (IT SHAP), which reformulates STII as the contraction of a Value Tensor and a Weight Tensor, and assume a finite state TT representation of the Weight Tensor with polynomial TT ranks. Under TT structured model and distribution tensors, we show that IT SHAP reduces the exponential complex Theta(4^n) of STII to NC2 parallel time. These results demonstrate that IT SHAP provides a unified, axiomatic, and computationally tractable formulation of main effects and higher order interactions in high dimensional models. This framework establishes a foundation for scalable interaction aware explainable AI, with implications for large black box models whose combinatorial structure has previously rendered interaction analysis infeasible.",

However, existing metrics for comparing optimization methods typically do not distinguish between these strategies, which often incur different communication costs in practice. To address this disparity, we introduce a simple and natural model of federated optimization that quantifies communication and local computation complexities. This new model allows for several commonly used client-selection strategies and explicitly associates each with a distinct cost. Within this setting, we propose a new algorithm that achieves the best-known communication and local complexities among existing federated optimization methods for non-convex optimization. This algorithm is based on the inexact composite gradient method with a carefully constructed gradient estimator and a special procedure for solving the auxiliary subproblem at each iteration. The gradient estimator is based on SAGA, a popular variance-reduced gradient estimator. We first derive a new variance bound for it, showing that SAGA can exploit functional similarity. We then introduce the Recursive-Gradient technique as a general way to potentially improve the error bound of a given conditionally unbiased gradient estimator, including both SAGA and SVRG. By applying this technique to SAGA, we obtain a new estimator, RG-SAGA, which has an improved error bound compared to the original one.",

In this paper, we test sensitivity and robustness of an artificial intelligence (AI) weather forecasting model: NVIDIAs FourCastNetv2 (FCNv2). We conduct two experiments designed to assess model output under different levels of injected noise in the models initial condition. First, we perturb the initial condition of Hurricane Florence from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset (September 13-16, 2018) with varying amounts of Gaussian noise and examine the impact on predicted trajectories and forecasted storm intensity. Second, we start FCNv2 with fully random initial conditions and observe how the model responds to nonsensical inputs. Our results indicate that FCNv2 accurately preserves hurricane features under low to moderate noise injection. Even under high levels of noise, the model maintains the general storm trajectory and structure, although positional accuracy begins to degrade. FCNv2 consistently underestimates storm intensity and persistence across all levels of injected noise. With full random initial conditions, the model generates smooth and cohesive forecasts after a few timesteps, implying the models tendency towards stable, smoothed outputs. Our approach is simple and portable to other data-driven AI weather forecasting models.",

However, the learning objectives and update dynamics of the Actor and Critic differ, raising concerns about whether uniform transition usage is optimal. Objectives: We aim to improve the performance of deep deterministic policy gradient algorithms by decoupling the transition batches used to train the Actor and the Critic. Our goal is to design an experience replay mechanism that provides appropriate learning signals to each component by using separate, tailored batches. Methods: We introduce Decoupled Prioritized Experience Replay (DPER), a novel approach that allows independent sampling of transition batches for the Actor and the Critic. DPER can be integrated into any off-policy deep reinforcement learning algorithm that operates in continuous control domains. We combine DPER with the state-of-the-art Twin Delayed DDPG algorithm and evaluate its performance across standard continuous control benchmarks. Results: DPER outperforms conventional experience replay strategies such as vanilla experience replay and prioritized experience replay in multiple MuJoCo tasks from the OpenAI Gym suite. Conclusions: Our findings show that decoupling experience replay for Actor and Critic networks can enhance training dynamics and final policy quality.

We introduce the Continuous Flow Operator (CFO), a framework that learns continuous-time PDE dynamics without the computational burden of standard continuous approaches, e.g., neural ODE. The key insight is repurposing flow matching to directly learn the right-hand side of PDEs without backpropagating through ODE solvers. CFO fits temporal splines to trajectory data, using finite-difference estimates of time derivatives at knots to construct probability paths whose velocities closely approximate the true PDE dynamics. A neural operator is then trained via flow matching to predict these analytic velocity fields. This approach is inherently time-resolution invariant: training accepts trajectories sampled on arbitrary, non-uniform time grids while inference queries solutions at any temporal resolution through ODE integration. Across four benchmarks (Lorenz, 1D Burgers, 2D diffusion-reaction, 2D shallow water), CFO demonstrates superior long-horizon stability and remarkable data efficiency. CFO trained on only 25% of irregularly subsampled time points outperforms autoregressive baselines trained on complete data, with relative error reductions up to 87%. Despite requiring numerical integration at inference, CFO achieves competitive efficiency, outperforming autoregressive baselines using only 50% of their function evaluations, while uniquely enabling reverse-time inference and arbitrary temporal querying.",

This model transforms drug-miRNA associations into graphs, employs Word2Vec for embedding features of drug molecular structures and miRNA base structures, and leverages a graph transformer model to learn from embedded features and relational structures, ultimately predicting associations between drugs and miRNAs. To evaluate DMAGT, we tested its performance on three datasets composed of drug-miRNA associations: ncDR, RNAInter, and SM2miR, achieving up to AUC of $95.24\\pm0.05$. DMAGT demonstrated superior performance in comparative experiments tackling similar challenges.

We introduce a multifidelity learning framework that corrects coarse quantum solutions to high-fidelity accuracy using sparse classical training data, facilitating the path toward practical quantum utility for scientific computing. The approach trains a low-fidelity surrogate on abundant quantum solver outputs, then learns correction mappings through a multifidelity neural architecture that balances linear and nonlinear transformations.

Similar to the propagation-aggregation methodology, the Weisfeiler-Lehman (1-WL) algorithm tests isomorphism through color refinement according to color representations of a node and its neighbor nodes. However, 1-WL does not leverage any edge features (labels), presenting a potential improvement on exploiting edge features in some fields. To address this limitation, we proposed a novel Edged-WL algorithm (E-WL) which extends the original 1-WL algorithm to incorporate edge features. Building upon the E-WL algorithm, we also introduce an Edged Graph Isomorphism Network (EGIN) model for further exploiting edge features, which addresses one key drawback in many GNNs that do not utilize any edge features of graph data. We evaluated the performance of proposed models using 12 edge-featured benchmark graph datasets and compared them with some state-of-the-art baseline models. Experimental results indicate that our proposed EGIN models, in general, demonstrate superior performance in graph learning on graph classification tasks.",

We introduce MAR-FL, a novel P2P FL system that leverages iterative group-based aggregation to substantially reduce communication overhead while retaining resilience to churn. MAR-FL achieves communication costs that scale as O(N log N), contrasting with the O(N^2) complexity of previously existing baselines, and thereby maintains effectiveness especially as the number of peers in an aggregation round grows.

Unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) aims to address this by minimising domain discrepancy during training, but the discrepancy estimates suffer from high variance in stochastic settings, which can stifle the theoretical benefits of the method. This paper proposes Variance-Reduced Domain Adaptation via Stratified Sampling (VaRDASS), the first specialised stochastic variance reduction technique for UDA. We consider two specific discrepancy measures -- correlation alignment and the maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) -- and derive ad hoc stratification objectives for these terms. We then present expected and worst-case error bounds, and prove that our proposed objective for the MMD is theoretically optimal (i.e., minimises the variance) under certain assumptions. Finally, a practical k-means style optimisation algorithm is introduced and analysed. Experiments on three domain shift datasets demonstrate improved discrepancy estimation accuracy and target domain performance.",

As a result, genomic data vastly outpace available phenotypic labels, limiting the effectiveness of traditional supervised models. We hypothesize that combining pre-trained Protein Language Models (PLMs) with Semi-Supervised Learning (SSL) can retain high predictive accuracy even when labeled data are scarce. We evaluated two SSL strategies, Self-training and Label Spreading, against fully supervised baselines using four PLM-derived embeddings (ESM-2, ProtVec, ProtT5, ProtBert) applied to haemagglutinin (HA) sequences. A nested cross-validation framework simulated low-label regimes (25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% label availability) across four IAV subtypes (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1, H9N2). SSL consistently improved performance under label scarcity. Self-training with ProtVec produced the largest relative gains, showing that SSL can compensate for lower-resolution representations. ESM-2 remained highly robust, achieving F1 scores above 0.82 with only 25% labeled data, indicating that its embeddings capture key antigenic determinants. While H1N1 and H9N2 were predicted with high accuracy, the hypervariable H3N2 subtype remained challenging, although SSL mitigated the performance decline. These findings demonstrate that integrating PLMs with SSL can address the antigenicity labeling bottleneck and enable more effective use of unlabeled surveillance sequences, supporting rapid variant prioritization and timely vaccine strain selection.",

Through controlled ablations across four clinical prediction tasks on MIMIC-IV, we demonstrate that explicit time encodings provide no consistent statistically significant benefit for the evaluated downstream tasks. Value features show task-dependent importance, affecting mortality prediction but not readmission, suggesting code sequences alone can carry sufficient predictive signal. We further show that frozen pretrained code encoders dramatically outperform their trainable counterparts while requiring dramatically fewer parameters. Larger clinical encoders provide consistent improvements across tasks, benefiting from frozen embeddings that eliminate computational overhead. Our controlled evaluation enables fairer tokenization comparisons and demonstrates that simpler, parameter-efficient approaches can, in many cases, achieve strong performance, though the optimal tokenization strategy remains task-dependent.",

However, existing approaches typically rely on uniform random masking, implicitly assuming all features are equally predictable. In reality, laboratory tests exhibit substantial heterogeneity in volatility: some biomarkers (e.g., sodium) remain stable, while others (e.g., lactate) fluctuate considerably and are more difficult to model. Clinically, volatile biomarkers often signal acute pathophysiology and require more sophisticated modeling to capture their complex temporal patterns. We propose a volatility-aware pretraining strategy, Coefficient of Variation Masking (CV-Masking), that adaptively adjusts masking probabilities according to the intrinsic variability of each feature. Combined with a value-only masking objective aligned with clinical workflows, CV-Masking yields systematic improvements over random and variance-based strategies. Experiments on a large panel of laboratory tests show that CV-Masking enhances reconstruction, improves downstream predictive performance, and accelerates convergence, producing more robust and clinically meaningful EHR representations.",

These include computational constraints, the limitations of single-view learning algorithms and the complexity of processing large datasets from different domains, sources or views. In this context, multi-view clustering (MVC), a class of unsupervised multi-view learning, emerges as a powerful approach to overcome these challenges. MVC compensates for the shortcomings of single-view methods and provides a richer data representation and effective solutions for a variety of unsupervised learning tasks. In contrast to traditional single-view approaches, the semantically rich nature of multi-view data increases its practical utility despite its inherent complexity. This survey makes a threefold contribution: (1) a systematic categorization of multi-view clustering methods into well-defined groups, including co-training, co-regularization, subspace, deep learning, kernel-based, anchor-based, and graph-based strategies; (2) an in-depth analysis of their respective strengths, weaknesses, and practical challenges, such as scalability and incomplete data; and (3) a forward-looking discussion of emerging trends, interdisciplinary applications, and future directions in MVC research. This study represents an extensive workload, encompassing the review of over 140 foundational and recent publications, the development of comparative insights on integration strategies such as early fusion, late fusion, and joint learning, and the structured investigation of practical use cases in the areas of healthcare, multimedia, and social network analysis.

While reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) methods traditionally rely on global kernel regressors, it is also common to use a smoothness-based approach that exploits local approximations. We show that these perspectives are deeply connected through the spectral properties of isotropic kernels. In particular, we characterize the Fourier spectra of the Matérn, square-exponential, rational-quadratic, $γ$-exponential, piecewise-polynomial, and Dirichlet kernels, and show that the decay rate determines asymptotic regret from both viewpoints. For kernelized bandit algorithms, spectral decay yields upper bounds on the maximum information gain, governing worst-case regret, while for smoothness-based methods, the same decay rates establish Hölder space embeddings and Besov space norm-equivalences, enabling local continuity analysis. These connections show that kernel-based and locally adaptive algorithms can be analyzed within a unified framework. This allows us to derive explicit regret bounds for each kernel family, obtaining novel results in several cases and providing improved analysis for others. Furthermore, we analyze LP-GP-UCB, an algorithm that combines both approaches, augmenting global Gaussian process surrogates with local polynomial estimators. While the hybrid approach does not uniformly dominate specialized methods, it achieves order-optimality across multiple kernel families.",

Accurate postoperative facial appearance prediction remains challenging due to the complex nonlinear interactions between skeletal movements and facial soft tissue. Existing biomechanical, parametric models and deep-learning approaches either lack computational efficiency or fail to fully capture these intricate interactions. To address these limitations, we propose Neural Implicit Craniofacial Model (NICE) which employs implicit neural representations for accurate anatomical reconstruction and surgical outcome prediction. NICE comprises a shape module, which employs region-specific implicit Signed Distance Function (SDF) decoders to reconstruct the facial surface, maxilla, and mandible, and a surgery module, which employs region-specific deformation decoders. These deformation decoders are driven by a shared surgical latent code to effectively model the complex, nonlinear biomechanical response of the facial surface to skeletal movements, incorporating anatomical prior knowledge. The deformation decoders output point-wise displacement fields, enabling precise modeling of surgical outcomes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that NICE outperforms current state-of-the-art methods, notably improving prediction accuracy in critical facial regions such as lips and chin, while robustly preserving anatomical integrity. This work provides a clinically viable tool for enhanced surgical planning and patient consultation in orthognathic procedures.",

This flexibility, however, makes correctness harder to ensure as the same extensibility that accelerates development also complicates maintaining the testing infrastructure. Extensible languages require automated test generation that is both dialect-agnostic (works across dialects without manual adaptation) and dialect-effective (targets dialect-specific features to find bugs). Existing approaches typically sacrifice one of these goals by either requiring manually constructed seed corpora for each dialect, or by failing to be effective. We present a dialect-agnostic and dialect-effective grammar-based and coverage-guided fuzzing approach for extensible compilers that combines two key insights from existing work: (i) the grammars of dialects, which already encode the structural and type constraints, can often be extracted automatically from the dialect specification; and (ii) these grammars can be used in combination with pre-trained large language models to automatically generate representative and diverse seed inputs from the full dialect space without requiring any manual input or training data. These seeds can then be used to bootstrap coverage-guided fuzzers. We built this approach into a tool, Germinator. When evaluated on six MLIR projects spanning 91 dialects, Germinator generated seeds improve line coverage by 10-120% over grammar-based baselines. We compare against grammar-based baselines because they are the only class of existing automatic seed generators that can be applied uniformly across MLIR's heterogeneous dialect ecosystem. Germinator discovers 88 previously unknown bugs (40 confirmed), including 23 in dialects with no prior automated test generators, demonstrating effective and controllable testing of low-resource dialects at scale.",

However, transforming the resulting high-dimensional data into interpretable deformation pattern maps remains a resource-intensive and largely manual process. In this work, we introduce a data-driven workflow that automates this interpretation step using unsupervised and supervised learning. Grain-orientation-colored computational tomograph pictures obtained from CuNi alloy simulations were first compressed through an autoencoder to a 32-dimensional global feature vector. Despite this strong compression, the reconstructed images retained the essential microstructural motifs: grain boundaries, stacking faults, twins, and partial lattice rotations, while omitting only the finest defects. The learned representations were then combined with simulation metadata (composition, load, time, temperature, and spatial position) to train a CNN-MLP model to predict the dominant deformation pattern. The resulting model achieves a prediction accuracy of approximately 96% on validation data. A refined evaluation strategy, in which an entire spatial region containing distinct grains was excluded from training, provides a more robust measure of generalization. The approach demonstrates that essential tribological deformation signatures can be automatically identified and classified from structural images using Machine Learning. This proof of concept constitutes a first step towards fully automated, data-driven construction of tribological mechanism maps and, ultimately, toward predictive modeling frameworks that may reduce the need for large-scale MD simulation campaigns.",

We formalize this layer via UCCT, a theory of semantic anchoring that models reasoning as a phase transition governed by effective support (rho_d), representational mismatch (d_r), and an adaptive anchoring budget (gamma log k). Under this lens, ungrounded generation is simply an unbaited retrieval of the substrate's maximum likelihood prior, while \"reasoning\" emerges when anchors shift the posterior toward goal-directed constraints. We translate UCCT into architecture with MACI, a coordination stack that implements baiting (behavior-modulated debate), filtering (Socratic judging), and persistence (transactional memory).

        "summary": "The past few years have seen the development of ``universal'' machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) capable of approximating the ground-state potential energy surface across a wide range of chemical structures and compositions with reasonable accuracy. While these models differ in the architecture and the dataset used, they share the ability to compress a staggering amount of chemical information into descriptive latent features. Herein, we systematically analyze what the different uMLIPs have learned by quantitatively assessing the relative information content of their latent features with feature reconstruction errors as metrics, and observing how the trends are affected by the choice of training set and training protocol. We find that the uMLIPs encode chemical space in significantly distinct ways, with substantial cross-model feature reconstruction errors. When variants of the same model architecture are considered, trends become dependent on the dataset, target, and training protocol of choice. We also observe that fine-tuning of a uMLIP retains a strong pre-training bias in the latent features. Finally, we discuss how atom-level features, which are directly output by MLIPs, can be compressed into global structure-level features via concatenation of progressive cumulants, each adding significantly new information about the variability across the atomic environments within a given system.",

The core of our method is a principled mechanism to encode the pixel space degradation operator into a continuous, multi-channel latent mask, thereby bypassing the costly bottleneck of repeated VAE operations and backpropagation. InverseCrafter not only achieves comparable novel view generation and superior measurement consistency in camera control tasks with near-zero computational overhead, but also excels at general-purpose video inpainting with editing.

Existing semantic alignment methods typically rely on additional digital processing at the transmitter or receiver, increasing overall device complexity. In this work, we introduce the first over-the-air semantic alignment framework based on stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM), which enables latent-space alignment directly in the wave domain, reducing substantially the computational burden at the device level. We model SIMs as trainable linear operators capable of emulating both supervised linear aligners and zero-shot Parseval-frame-based equalizers. To realize these operators physically, we develop a gradient-based optimization procedure that tailors the metasurface transfer function to a desired semantic mapping. Experiments with heterogeneous vision transformer (ViT) encoders show that SIMs can accurately reproduce both supervised and zero-shot semantic equalizers, achieving up to 90% task accuracy in regimes with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), while maintaining strong robustness even at low SNR values.",

While visual arts such as painting and architecture have been studied through eye tracking, revealing distinct gaze patterns between experts and novices, analogous methods for auditory art forms remain underdeveloped. Music, despite being a pervasive component of modern life and culture, still lacks objective tools to quantify listeners' attention and perceptual focus during natural listening experiences. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to decode selective attention to musical elements using naturalistic, studio-produced songs and a lightweight consumer-grade EEG device with only four electrodes. By analyzing neural responses during real world like music listening, we test whether decoding is feasible under conditions that minimize participant burden and preserve the authenticity of the musical experience. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) decoding music attention in real studio-produced songs, (ii) demonstrating feasibility with a four-channel consumer EEG, (iii) providing insights for music attention decoding, and (iv) demonstrating improved model ability over prior work. Our findings suggest that musical attention can be decoded not only for novel songs but also across new subjects, showing performance improvements compared to existing approaches under our tested conditions. These findings show that consumer-grade devices can reliably capture signals, and that neural decoding in music could be feasible in real-world settings.

LLMs require few, if any, training examples and can be utilized by users without expertise in model development. However, this comes at the cost of substantially higher resource and energy consumption compared to smaller models, which often achieve similar predictive performance for simple tasks. In this paper, we present our vision for just-in-time model replacement (JITR), where, upon identifying a recurring task in calls to an LLM, the model is replaced transparently with a cheaper alternative that performs well for this specific task. JITR retains the ease of use and low development effort of LLMs, while saving significant cost and energy. We discuss the main challenges in realizing our vision regarding the identification of recurring tasks and the creation of a custom model. Specifically, we argue that model search and transfer learning will play a crucial role in JITR to efficiently identify and fine-tune models for a recurring task. Using our JITR prototype Poodle, we achieve significant savings for exemplary tasks.",

        "summary": "Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) integrates various modalities, such as text, image, and audio, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of sentiment. However, effective MSA is challenged by alignment and fusion issues. Alignment requires synchronizing both temporal and semantic information across modalities, while fusion involves integrating these aligned features into a unified representation. Existing methods often address alignment or fusion in isolation, leading to limitations in performance and efficiency. To tackle these issues, we propose a novel framework called Dual-stream Alignment with Hierarchical Bottleneck Fusion (DashFusion). Firstly, dual-stream alignment module synchronizes multimodal features through temporal and semantic alignment. Temporal alignment employs cross-modal attention to establish frame-level correspondences among multimodal sequences. Semantic alignment ensures consistency across the feature space through contrastive learning. Secondly, supervised contrastive learning leverages label information to refine the modality features. Finally, hierarchical bottleneck fusion progressively integrates multimodal information through compressed bottleneck tokens, which achieves a balance between performance and computational efficiency. We evaluate DashFusion on three datasets: CMU-MOSI, CMU-MOSEI, and CH-SIMS. Experimental results demonstrate that DashFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics, and ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our alignment and fusion techniques.

Artifact classification offers advantages in stability and transparency, providing a viable alternative to ICA-based methods that enable flexible use alongside human inspections and across various applications. However, artifact classification is limited by its training data as it requires extensive manual labeling, which cannot fully cover the diversity of real-world EEG. Semi-synthetic data (SSD) methods have been proposed to address this limitation, but prior approaches typically injected single artifact types using ICA components or required separately recorded artifact signals, reducing both the realism of the generated data and the applicability of the method. To overcome these issues, we introduce SSDLabeler, a framework that generates realistic, annotated SSDs by decomposing real EEG with ICA, epoch-level artifact verification using RMS and PSD criteria, and reinjecting multiple artifact types into clean data. When applied to train a multi-label artifact classifier, it improved accuracy on raw EEG across diverse conditions compared to prior SSD and raw EEG training, establishing a scalable foundation for artifact handling that captures the co-occurrence and complexity of real EEG.",

Though appealing for financial and logistical reasons, using standard tools for inference can misrepresent the association between independent variables and the outcome of interest when the true, unobserved outcome is replaced by a predicted value. In this paper, we characterize the statistical challenges inherent to drawing inference with predicted data (IPD) and show that high predictive accuracy does not guarantee valid downstream inference. We show that all such failures reduce to statistical notions of (i) bias, when predictions systematically shift the estimand or distort relationships among variables, and (ii) variance, when uncertainty from the prediction model and the intrinsic variability of the true data are ignored. We then review recent methods for conducting IPD and discuss how this framework is deeply rooted in classical statistical theory. We then comment on some open questions and interesting avenues for future work in this area, and end with some comments on how to use predicted data in scientific studies that is both transparent and statistically principled.",

Object verification has relied heavily on human eyes, which usually results in significant labor costs. In order to address this limitation and reduce the reliance on manual intervention, we propose a multi-input convolutional neural network integrated with a convolutional block attention module. This method is specifically tailored to enhance the moving object detection system that we have developed and used previously. The current method introduces two innovations. This first one is a multi-input architecture that processes multiple stacked images simultaneously. The second is the incorporation of the convolutional block attention module which enables the model to focus on essential features in both spatial and channel dimensions. These advancements facilitate efficient learning from multiple inputs, leading to more robust detection of moving objects. The performance of the model is evaluated on a dataset consisting of approximately 2,000 observational images. We achieved an accuracy of nearly 99% with AUC (an Area Under the Curve) of >0.99. These metrics indicate that the proposed model achieves excellent classification performance. By adjusting the threshold for object detection, the new model reduces the human workload by more than 99% compared to manual verification.",

        "summary": "Malicious WebShells pose a significant and evolving threat by compromising critical digital infrastructures and endangering public services in sectors such as healthcare and finance. While the research community has made significant progress in WebShell detection (i.e., distinguishing malicious samples from benign ones), we argue that it is time to transition from passive detection to in-depth analysis and proactive defense. One promising direction is the automation of WebShell family classification, which involves identifying the specific malware lineage in order to understand an adversary's tactics and enable a precise, rapid response. This crucial task, however, remains a largely unexplored area that currently relies on slow, manual expert analysis. To address this gap, we present the first systematic study to automate WebShell family classification. Our method begins with extracting dynamic function call traces to capture inherent behaviors that are resistant to common encryption and obfuscation. To enhance the scale and diversity of our dataset for a more stable evaluation, we augment these real-world traces with new variants synthesized by Large Language Models. These augmented traces are then abstracted into sequences, graphs, and trees, providing a foundation to benchmark a comprehensive suite of representation methods. Our evaluation spans classic sequence-based embeddings (CBOW, GloVe), transformers (BERT, SimCSE), and a range of structure-aware algorithms, including Graph Kernels, Graph Edit Distance, Graph2Vec, and various Graph Neural Networks. Through extensive experiments on four real-world, family-annotated datasets under both supervised and unsupervised settings, we establish a robust baseline and provide practical insights into the most effective combinations of data abstractions, representation models, and learning paradigms for this challenge.",

        "summary": "We study the problem of robust forecast aggregation: combining expert forecasts with provable accuracy guarantees compared to the best possible aggregation of the underlying information. Prior work shows strong impossibility results, e.g. that even under natural assumptions, no aggregation of the experts' individual forecasts can outperform simply following a random expert (Neyman and Roughgarden, 2022). In this paper, we introduce a more general framework that allows the principal to elicit richer information from experts through structured queries. Our framework ensures that experts will truthfully report their underlying beliefs, and also enables us to define notions of complexity over the difficulty of asking these queries. Under a general model of independent but overlapping expert signals, we show that optimal aggregation is achievable in the worst case with each complexity measure bounded above by the number of agents $n$. We further establish tight tradeoffs between accuracy and query complexity: aggregation error decreases linearly with the number of queries, and vanishes when the \"order of reasoning\" and number of agents relevant to a query is $ω(\\sqrt{n})$. These results demonstrate that modest extensions to the space of expert queries dramatically strengthen the power of robust forecast aggregation. We therefore expect that our new query framework will open up a fruitful line of research in this area.",

This scarcity introduces epistemic uncertainty, i.e., reducible uncertainty stemming from incomplete knowledge of the underlying data distribution, which fundamentally limits predictive performance. This review paper examines formal methodologies that address data-limited regimes through two complementary approaches: quantifying epistemic uncertainty and mitigating data scarcity via synthetic data augmentation. We begin by reviewing generalized Bayesian learning frameworks that characterize epistemic uncertainty through generalized posteriors in the model parameter space, as well as ``post-Bayes'' learning frameworks. We continue by presenting information-theoretic generalization bounds that formalize the relationship between training data quantity and predictive uncertainty, providing a theoretical justification for generalized Bayesian learning. Moving beyond methods with asymptotic statistical validity, we survey uncertainty quantification methods that provide finite-sample statistical guarantees, including conformal prediction and conformal risk control. Finally, we examine recent advances in data efficiency by combining limited labeled data with abundant model predictions or synthetic data. Throughout, we take an information-theoretic perspective, highlighting the role of information measures in quantifying the impact of data scarcity.",

Existing sampling algorithms typically require many iterative steps to produce high-quality samples, leading to high computational costs. We introduce one-step diffusion samplers which learn a step-conditioned ODE so that one large step reproduces the trajectory of many small ones via a state-space consistency loss. We further show that standard ELBO estimates in diffusion samplers degrade in the few-step regime because common discrete integrators yield mismatched forward/backward transition kernels. Motivated by this analysis, we derive a deterministic-flow (DF) importance weight for ELBO estimation without a backward kernel. To calibrate DF, we introduce a volume-consistency regularization that aligns the accumulated volume change along the flow across step resolutions. Our proposed sampler therefore achieves both sampling and stable evidence estimate in only one or few steps. Across challenging synthetic and Bayesian benchmarks, it achieves competitive sample quality with orders-of-magnitude fewer network evaluations while maintaining robust ELBO estimates.",

Yet experimental annotation lags far behind the rapid growth of protein sequence data. Computational approaches address this gap by associating proteins with Gene Ontology (GO) terms, which encode functional knowledge through hierarchical relations and textual definitions. However, existing models often emphasize one modality over the other, limiting their ability to generalize, particularly to unseen or newly introduced GO terms that frequently arise as the ontology evolves, and making the previously trained models outdated. We present STAR-GO, a Transformer-based framework that jointly models the semantic and structural characteristics of GO terms to enhance zero-shot protein function prediction. STAR-GO integrates textual definitions with ontology graph structure to learn unified GO representations, which are processed in hierarchical order to propagate information from general to specific terms. These representations are then aligned with protein sequence embeddings to capture sequence-function relationships. STAR-GO achieves state-of-the-art performance and superior zero-shot generalization, demonstrating the utility of integrating semantics and structure for robust and adaptable protein function prediction.

        "summary": "Latent inpainting in diffusion models still relies almost universally on linearly interpolating VAE latents under a downsampled mask. We propose a key principle for compositing image latents: Pixel-Equivalent Latent Compositing (PELC). An equivalent latent compositor should be the same as compositing in pixel space. This principle enables full-resolution mask control and true soft-edge alpha compositing, even though VAEs compress images 8x spatially. Modern VAEs capture global context beyond patch-aligned local structure, so linear latent blending cannot be pixel-equivalent: it produces large artifacts at mask seams and global degradation and color shifts. We introduce DecFormer, a 7.7M-parameter transformer that predicts per-channel blend weights and an off-manifold residual correction to realize mask-consistent latent fusion. DecFormer is trained so that decoding after fusion matches pixel-space alpha compositing, is plug-compatible with existing diffusion pipelines, requires no backbone finetuning and adds only 0.07% of FLUX.1-Dev's parameters and 3.5% FLOP overhead. On the FLUX.1 family, DecFormer restores global color consistency, soft-mask support, sharp boundaries, and high-fidelity masking, reducing error metrics around edges by up to 53% over standard mask interpolation. Used as an inpainting prior, a lightweight LoRA on FLUX.1-Dev with DecFormer achieves fidelity comparable to FLUX.1-Fill, a fully finetuned inpainting model. While we focus on inpainting, PELC is a general recipe for pixel-equivalent latent editing, as we demonstrate on a complex color-correction task.",

The associated transfer operator $P: L^2(M,μ) \\to L^2(M,μ)$ encodes the propagation of semantic mass. Under mild regularity assumptions (compactness, ergodicity, bounded Jacobian), $P$ is compact with discrete spectrum. Within this setting, we prove the Semantic Characterization Theorem (SCT): the leading eigenfunctions of $P$ induce finitely many spectral basins of invariant meaning, each definable in an o-minimal structure over $\\mathbb{R}$. Thus spectral lumpability and logical tameness coincide. This explains how discrete symbolic semantics can emerge from continuous computation: the continuous activation manifold collapses into a finite, logically interpretable ontology. We further extend the SCT to stochastic and adiabatic (time-inhomogeneous) settings, showing that slowly drifting kernels preserve compactness, spectral coherence, and basin structure.",

Our approach combines a lightweight U-Net transfer encoder with a diffusion-based generative model. The simpler U-Net is first pretrained on a long time series of coarse resolution data to learn spatiotemporal representations; its encoder is then frozen and transferred to a larger downscaling model as physically meaningful latent features. Our application uses NASA's MERRA-2 reanalysis as the low resolution source domain (50 km) and the GEOS-5 Nature Run (G5NR) as the high resolution target (7 km). Our study area included a large area in Asia, which was made computationally tractable by splitting into two subregions and four seasons. We conducted domain similarity analysis using Wasserstein distances confirmed minimal distributional shift between MERRA-2 and G5NR, validating the safety of parameter frozen transfer. Across seasonal regional splits, our model achieved excellent performance (R2 = 0.65 to 0.94), outperforming comparison models including deterministic U-Nets, variational autoencoders, and prior transfer learning baselines. Out of data evaluations using semivariograms, ACF/PACF, and lag-based RMSE/R2 demonstrated that the predicted downscaled images preserved physically consistent spatial variability and temporal autocorrelation, enabling stable autoregressive reconstruction beyond the G5NR record. These results show that transfer enhanced diffusion models provide a robust and physically coherent solution for downscaling a long time series of coarse resolution images with limited training periods.

From a few deterministic runs, we compute a per-timestep, per-layer, per-module binary cache plan matrix and use a re-sampling correction to avoid drift when consecutive caches occur. Using quantile-based change metrics, this matrix specifies which module at which step is reused rather than recomputed. The same invariance criterion is applied at the step scale to enable cross-timestep caching, deciding whether an entire step can reuse cached results. During inference, InvarDiff performs step-first and layer-wise caching guided by this matrix. When applied to DiT and FLUX, our approach reduces redundant compute while preserving fidelity.

However, estimating personalized networks typically requires intensive longitudinal data, which is not always feasible. A solution to facilitate scalability of network-driven treatment personalization is leveraging LLMs. In this study, we present an end-to-end pipeline for automatically generating client networks from 77 therapy transcripts to support case conceptualization and treatment planning. We annotated 3364 psychological processes and their corresponding dimensions in therapy transcripts. Using these data, we applied in-context learning to jointly identify psychological processes and their dimensions. The method achieved high performance even with a few training examples. To organize the processes into networks, we introduced a two-step method that grouped them into clinically meaningful clusters. We then generated explanation-augmented relationships between clusters. Experts found that networks produced by our multi-step approach outperformed those built with direct prompting for clinical utility and interpretability, with up to 90% preferring our approach. In addition, the networks were rated favorably by experts, with scores for clinical relevance, novelty, and usefulness ranging from 72-75%. Our findings provide a proof of concept for using LLMs to create clinically relevant networks from therapy transcripts. Advantages of our approach include bottom-up case conceptualization from client utterances in therapy sessions and identification of latent themes.

This work introduces a Multimodal Oncology Agent (MOA) integrating a histology tool based on the TITAN foundation model for IDH1 mutation prediction in low-grade glioma, combined with reasoning over structured clinical and genomic inputs through PubMed, Google Search, and OncoKB. MOA reports were quantitatively evaluated on 488 patients from the TCGA-LGG cohort against clinical and histology baselines. MOA without the histology tool outperformed the clinical baseline, achieving an F1-score of 0.826 compared to 0.798. When fused with histology features, MOA reached the highest performance with an F1-score of 0.912, exceeding both the histology baseline at 0.894 and the fused histology-clinical baseline at 0.897. These results demonstrate that the proposed agent captures complementary mutation-relevant information enriched through external biomedical sources, enabling accurate IDH1 mutation prediction.",

While recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) show substantial specific skills for a wide array of downstream tasks, they more or less fall shorts in general intelligence. Following correlation between intelligence and system 2 reasoning (slow thinking), in this paper, we aim to answering a worthwhile research question: could machine intelligence such as LLMs be evolved to acquire reasoning ability (not specific skill) just like our human beings? To this end, we propose evolutionary reasoning optimization (ERO) framework which performs survival of the fittest over a population of LLMs to search for individual with strong reasoning ability. Given a reasoning task, ERO first initializes multiple LLMs as a population, after which an evolutionary strategy evolves the population to maximize quantified reasoning score of the best individual. Based on experiments on representative testsuites, we claim two surprising empirical discoveries: i) the latest LLMs such as GPT-5 still show limited system 2 reasoning ability; ii) with simple evolution-loop of ERO, a relatively weak model (Qwen-7B) could be enhanced to emerge powerful reasoning ability.

Recent advances in Stochastic Local Search (SLS) algorithms for solving (W)PMS have mainly focused on designing clause weighting schemes. However, existing methods often fail to adequately distinguish between PMS and WPMS, typically employing uniform update strategies for clause weights and overlooking critical structural differences between the two problem types. In this work, we present a novel clause weighting scheme that, for the first time, updates the clause weights of PMS and WPMS instances according to distinct conditions. This scheme also introduces a new initialization method, which better accommodates the unique characteristics of both instance types. Furthermore, we propose a decimation method that prioritizes satisfying unit and hard clauses, effectively complementing our proposed clause weighting scheme. Building on these methods, we develop a new SLS solver for (W)PMS named DeepDist. Experimental results on benchmarks from the anytime tracks of recent MaxSAT Evaluations show that DeepDist outperforms state-of-the-art SLS solvers. Notably, a hybrid solver combining DeepDist with TT-Open-WBO-Inc surpasses the performance of the MaxSAT Evaluation 2024 winners, SPB-MaxSAT-c-Band and SPB-MaxSAT-c-FPS, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

By orchestrating specialized TxAgents (Executors) with long-context foundation models (Analysts), we mitigate the reasoning deficits observed in monolithic models. Beyond simple modularity, we demonstrate that a Stratified Ensemble strategy significantly outperforms global pooling by preserving evidentiary diversity, effectively addressing the information bottleneck. Furthermore, our stress tests reveal critical scaling insights: (1) a \\textit{Context-Performance Paradox}, where extending reasoning contexts beyond 12k tokens introduces noise that degrades accuracy; and (2) the \\textit{Curse of Dimensionality} in action spaces, where expanding toolsets necessitates hierarchical retrieval strategies. Crucially, our approach underscores the potential of training-free architectural engineering, achieving state-of-the-art performance on CURE-Bench without the need for expensive end-to-end finetuning.

        "summary": "Recently, multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have been widely applied to reasoning tasks. However, they suffer from limited multi-rationale semantic modeling, insufficient logical robustness, and are susceptible to misleading interpretations in complex scenarios. Therefore, we propose a Multi-rationale INtegrated Discriminative (MIND) reasoning framework, which is designed to endow MLLMs with human-like cognitive abilities of \"Understand -> Rethink -> Correct\", and achieves a paradigm evolution from passive imitation-based reasoning to active discriminative reasoning. Specifically, we introduce a Rationale Augmentation and Discrimination (RAD) paradigm, which automatically and efficiently expands existing datasets by generating diverse rationales, providing a unified and extensible data foundation. Meanwhile, we design a Progressive Two-stage Correction Learning (P2CL) strategy. The first phase enhances multi-rationale positive learning, while the second phase enables active logic discrimination and correction. In addition, to mitigate representation entanglement in the multi-rationale semantic space, we propose a Multi-rationale Contrastive Alignment (MCA) optimization strategy, which achieves semantic aggregation of correct reasoning and boundary separation of incorrect reasoning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed MIND reasoning framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple public datasets covering scientific, commonsense, and mathematical scenarios. It provides a new perspective for advancing MLLMs towards higher levels of cognitive intelligence. Our code is available at https://github.com/YuChuang1205/MIND",

We propose akrasia as a foundational concept for analyzing inconsistency and goal drift in agentic AI systems. To operationalize it, we introduce a preliminary version of the Akrasia Benchmark, currently a structured set of prompting conditions (Baseline [B], Synonym [S], Temporal [T], and Temptation [X]) that measures when a model's local response contradicts its own prior commitments. The benchmark enables quantitative comparison of \"self-control\" across model families, decoding strategies, and temptation types. Beyond single-model evaluation, we outline how micro-level akrasia may compound into macro-level instability in multi-agent systems that may be interpreted as \"scheming\" or deliberate misalignment. By reframing inconsistency as weakness of will, this work connects agentic behavior to classical theories of agency and provides an empirical bridge between philosophy, psychology, and the emerging science of agentic AI.",

It then leverages the ChipKG-Augmented Reasoning mechanism, combining information-theoretic adaptive retrieval to dynamically trace logical dependencies with intent-aware semantic filtering to prune irrelevant noise, effectively balancing retrieval completeness and precision. Evaluated on an industrial-scale specification reasoning benchmark, ChipMind significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average improvement of 34.59% (up to 72.73%).

This paper introduces a completely innovative architecture and concept: combining the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with a specific clinical application, known as MCP-AI. This integration allows intelligent agents to reason over extended periods, collaborate securely, and adhere to authentic clinical logic, representing a significant shift away from traditional Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) and prompt-based Large Language Models (LLMs). As healthcare systems become more complex, the need for autonomous, context-aware clinical reasoning frameworks has become urgent. We present MCP-AI, a novel architecture for explainable medical decision-making built upon the Model Context Protocol (MCP) a modular, executable specification for orchestrating generative and descriptive AI agents in real-time workflows. Each MCP file captures clinical objectives, patient context, reasoning state, and task logic, forming a reusable and auditable memory object. Unlike conventional CDSS or stateless prompt-based AI systems, MCP-AI supports adaptive, longitudinal, and collaborative reasoning across care settings. MCP-AI is validated through two use cases: (1) diagnostic modeling of Fragile X Syndrome with comorbid depression, and (2) remote coordination for Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. In either scenario, the protocol facilitates physician-in-the-loop validation, streamlines clinical processes, and guarantees secure transitions of AI responsibilities between healthcare providers. The system connects with HL7/FHIR interfaces and adheres to regulatory standards, such as HIPAA and FDA SaMD guidelines. MCP-AI provides a scalable basis for interpretable, composable, and safety-oriented AI within upcoming clinical environments.",

Powered by Gemini 2.5 Pro and delivered through a lightweight Gradio front-end with client-side bpmn-js visualisation, the assistant conducts an interview-style dialogue: it elicits process details, supports clarifying dialogue and on-demand analysis, and renders live diagrams that users can refine in real time. A proof-of-concept evaluation in an equipment-maintenance scenario shows that the chatbot produced an accurate \"AS-IS\" model, flagged issues via on-diagram annotations, and generated an improved \"TO-BE\" variant, all within about 12-minutes, while keeping API costs within an SME-friendly budget. The study analyses latency sources, model-selection trade-offs, and the challenges of enforcing strict XML schemas, then outlines a roadmap toward agentic and multimodal deployments. The results demonstrate that conversational LLMs can potentially be used to lower the skill and cost barriers to rigorous process documentation, helping SMEs preserve institutional knowledge, enhance operational transparency, and accelerate continuous-improvement efforts.",

Our method requires no modifications to the model architecture or robot runtime, and can be implemented with only a few additional lines of code. In simulated experiments, we find that training-time RTC outperforms inference-time RTC at higher inference delays. In real-world experiments on box building and espresso making tasks with the $π_{0.6}$ VLA, we demonstrate that training-time RTC maintains both task performance and speed parity with inference-time RTC while being computationally cheaper.

        "summary": "Underwater images often suffer from severe color distortion, low contrast, and a hazy appearance due to wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering. Simultaneously, existing deep learning models exhibit high computational complexity, which limits their practical deployment for real-time underwater applications. To address these challenges, this paper presents a novel underwater image enhancement model, called Adaptive Frequency Fusion and Illumination Aware Network (AQUA-Net). It integrates a residual encoder decoder with dual auxiliary branches, which operate in the frequency and illumination domains. The frequency fusion encoder enriches spatial representations with frequency cues from the Fourier domain and preserves fine textures and structural details. Inspired by Retinex, the illumination-aware decoder performs adaptive exposure correction through a learned illumination map that separates reflectance from lighting effects. This joint spatial, frequency, and illumination design enables the model to restore color balance, visual contrast, and perceptual realism under diverse underwater conditions. Additionally, we present a high-resolution, real-world underwater video-derived dataset from the Mediterranean Sea, which captures challenging deep-sea conditions with realistic visual degradations to enable robust evaluation and development of deep learning models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that AQUA-Net performs on par with SOTA in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations while using less number of parameters. Ablation studies further confirm that the frequency and illumination branches provide complementary contributions that improve visibility and color representation. Overall, the proposed model shows strong generalization capability and robustness, and it provides an effective solution for real-world underwater imaging applications.",

Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance.

        "summary": "Recent advances in generative video models have led to significant breakthroughs in high-fidelity video synthesis, specifically in controllable video generation where the generated video is conditioned on text and action inputs, e.g., in instruction-guided video editing and world modeling in robotics. Despite these exceptional capabilities, controllable video models often hallucinate - generating future video frames that are misaligned with physical reality - which raises serious concerns in many tasks such as robot policy evaluation and planning. However, state-of-the-art video models lack the ability to assess and express their confidence, impeding hallucination mitigation. To rigorously address this challenge, we propose C3, an uncertainty quantification (UQ) method for training continuous-scale calibrated controllable video models for dense confidence estimation at the subpatch level, precisely localizing the uncertainty in each generated video frame. Our UQ method introduces three core innovations to empower video models to estimate their uncertainty. First, our method develops a novel framework that trains video models for correctness and calibration via strictly proper scoring rules. Second, we estimate the video model's uncertainty in latent space, avoiding training instability and prohibitive training costs associated with pixel-space approaches. Third, we map the dense latent-space uncertainty to interpretable pixel-level uncertainty in the RGB space for intuitive visualization, providing high-resolution uncertainty heatmaps that identify untrustworthy regions. Through extensive experiments on large-scale robot learning datasets (Bridge and DROID) and real-world evaluations, we demonstrate that our method not only provides calibrated uncertainty estimates within the training distribution, but also enables effective out-of-distribution detection.",

        "summary": "This study focuses on event detection in optical fibers, specifically classifying six events using the Phase-OTDR system. A novel approach is introduced to enhance Phase-OTDR data analysis by transforming 1D data into grayscale images through techniques such as Gramian Angular Difference Field, Gramian Angular Summation Field, and Recurrence Plot. These grayscale images are combined into a multi-channel RGB representation, enabling more robust and adaptable analysis using transfer learning models. The proposed methodology achieves high classification accuracies of 98.84% and 98.24% with the EfficientNetB0 and DenseNet121 models, respectively. A 5-fold cross-validation process confirms the reliability of these models, with test accuracy rates of 99.07% and 98.68%. Using a publicly available Phase-OTDR dataset, the study demonstrates an efficient approach to understanding optical fiber events while reducing dataset size and improving analysis efficiency. The results highlight the transformative potential of image-based analysis in interpreting complex fiber optic sensing data, offering significant advancements in the accuracy and reliability of fiber optic monitoring systems.

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) remain limited in spatial reasoning tasks that require multi-view understanding and embodied perspective shifts. Recent approaches such as MindJourney attempt to mitigate this gap through test-time scaling where a world model imagines action-conditioned trajectories and a heuristic verifier selects helpful views from such trajectories. In this work, we systematically examine how such test-time verifiers behave across benchmarks, uncovering both their promise and their pitfalls. Our uncertainty-based analyses show that MindJourney's verifier provides little meaningful calibration, and that random scoring often reduces answer entropy equally well, thus exposing systematic action biases and unreliable reward signals. To mitigate these, we introduce a Verification through Spatial Assertions (ViSA) framework that grounds the test-time reward in verifiable, frame-anchored micro-claims. This principled verifier consistently improves spatial reasoning on the SAT-Real benchmark and corrects trajectory-selection biases through more balanced exploratory behavior. However, on the challenging MMSI-Bench, none of the verifiers, including ours, achieve consistent scaling, suggesting that the current world models form an information bottleneck where imagined views fail to enrich fine-grained reasoning. Together, these findings chart the bad, good, and ugly aspects of test-time verification for world-model-based reasoning.

        "summary": "Robotic systems are transforming image-guided interventions by enhancing accuracy and minimizing radiation exposure. A significant challenge in robotic assistance lies in surgical path planning, which often relies on the registration of intraoperative 2D images with preoperative 3D CT scans. This requirement can be burdensome and costly, particularly in procedures like vertebroplasty, where preoperative CT scans are not routinely performed. To address this issue, we introduce a differentiable rendering-based framework for 3D transpedicular path planning utilizing bi-planar 2D X-rays. Our method integrates differentiable rendering with a vertebral atlas generated through a Statistical Shape Model (SSM) and employs a learned similarity loss to refine the SSM shape and pose dynamically, independent of fixed imaging geometries. We evaluated our framework in two stages: first, through vertebral reconstruction from orthogonal X-rays for benchmarking, and second, via clinician-in-the-loop path planning using arbitrary-view X-rays. Our results indicate that our method outperformed a normalized cross-correlation baseline in reconstruction metrics (DICE: 0.75 vs. 0.65) and achieved comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model ReVerteR (DICE: 0.77), while maintaining generalization to arbitrary views. Success rates for bipedicular planning reached 82% with synthetic data and 75% with cadaver data, exceeding the 66% and 31% rates of a 2D-to-3D baseline, respectively. In conclusion, our framework facilitates versatile, CT-free 3D path planning for robot-assisted vertebroplasty, effectively accommodating real-world imaging diversity without the need for preoperative CT scans.",

        "summary": "The development of foundation models for embodied intelligence critically depends on access to large-scale, high-quality robot demonstration data. Recent approaches have sought to address this challenge by training on large collections of heterogeneous robotic datasets. However, unlike vision or language data, robotic demonstrations exhibit substantial heterogeneity across embodiments and action spaces as well as other prominent variations such as senor configurations and action control frequencies. The lack of explicit designs for handling such heterogeneity causes existing methods to struggle with integrating diverse factors, thereby limiting their generalization and leading to degraded performance when transferred to new settings. In this paper, we present HiMoE-VLA, a novel vision-language-action (VLA) framework tailored to effectively handle diverse robotic data with heterogeneity. Specifically, we introduce a Hierarchical Mixture-of-Experts (HiMoE) architecture for the action module which adaptively handles multiple sources of heterogeneity across layers and gradually abstracts them into shared knowledge representations. Through extensive experimentation with simulation benchmarks and real-world robotic platforms, HiMoE-VLA demonstrates a consistent performance boost over existing VLA baselines, achieving higher accuracy and robust generalization across diverse robots and action spaces.

DepSeg first estimates a relative depth map with a pretrained monocular depth estimation network and proposes depth-guided point prompts, which SAM2 converts into class-agnostic masks. Each mask is then described by a pooled pretrained visual feature and classified via template matching against a template bank built from annotated frames.

First, users acted as critical evaluators of realism, assessing micro-details such as lighting, shadows, fluid motion, and physics to judge whether AI-generated scenes could plausibly exist. Second, users increasingly shifted from passive viewers to active creators, expressing curiosity about prompts, techniques, and creative processes. Text prompts were perceived as intellectual property, generating concerns about plagiarism and remixing norms. Third, users reported blurred boundaries between real and synthetic media, worried about misinformation, and even questioned the authenticity of other commenters, suspecting bot-generated engagement. Fourth, users contested platform governance: some perceived moderation as inconsistent or opaque, while others shared tactics for evading prompt censorship through misspellings, alternative phrasing, emojis, or other languages. Despite this, many users also enforced ethical norms by discouraging the misuse of real people's images or disrespectful content. Together, these patterns highlighted how AI-mediated platforms complicate notions of reality, creativity, and rule-making in emerging digital ecosystems.

        "summary": "A frustratingly easy technique known as the prefilling attack has been shown to effectively circumvent the safety alignment of frontier LLMs by simply prefilling the assistant response with an affirmative prefix before decoding. In response, recent work proposed a supervised fine-tuning (SFT) defense using data augmentation to achieve a \\enquote{deep} safety alignment, allowing the model to generate natural language refusals immediately following harmful prefills. Unfortunately, we show in this work that the \"deep\" safety alignment produced by such an approach is in fact not very deep. A generalization of the prefilling attack, which we refer to as the Rank-Assisted Prefilling (RAP) attack, can effectively extract harmful content from models fine-tuned with the data augmentation defense by selecting low-probability \"harmful\" tokens from the top 20 predicted next tokens at each step (thus ignoring high-probability \"refusal\" tokens). We argue that this vulnerability is enabled due to the \"gaming\" of the SFT objective when the target distribution entropies are low, where low fine-tuning loss is achieved by shifting large probability mass to a small number of refusal tokens while neglecting the high ranks of harmful tokens. We then propose a new perspective on achieving deep safety alignment by matching the token ranks of the target distribution, rather than their probabilities. This perspective yields a surprisingly simple fix to the data augmentation defense based on regularizing the attention placed on harmful prefill tokens, an approach we call PRefill attEntion STOpping (PRESTO). Adding PRESTO yields up to a 4.7x improvement in the mean StrongREJECT score under RAP attacks across three popular open-source LLMs, with low impact to model utility.",

        "summary": "Recently, Multi-Contrast MR Reconstruction (MCMR) has emerged as a hot research topic that leverages high-quality auxiliary modalities to reconstruct undersampled target modalities of interest. However, existing methods often struggle to generalize across different k-space undersampling patterns, requiring the training of a separate model for each specific pattern, which limits their practical applicability. To address this challenge, we propose UniFS, a Unified Frequency-Spatial Fusion model designed to handle multiple k-space undersampling patterns for MCMR tasks without any need for retraining. UniFS integrates three key modules: a Cross-Modal Frequency Fusion module, an Adaptive Mask-Based Prompt Learning module, and a Dual-Branch Complementary Refinement module. These modules work together to extract domain-invariant features from diverse k-space undersampling patterns while dynamically adapt to their own variations. Another limitation of existing MCMR methods is their tendency to focus solely on spatial information while neglect frequency characteristics, or extract only shallow frequency features, thus failing to fully leverage complementary cross-modal frequency information. To relieve this issue, UniFS introduces an adaptive prompt-guided frequency fusion module for k-space learning, significantly enhancing the model's generalization performance. We evaluate our model on the BraTS and HCP datasets with various k-space undersampling patterns and acceleration factors, including previously unseen patterns, to comprehensively assess UniFS's generalizability. Experimental results across multiple scenarios demonstrate that UniFS achieves state-of-the-art performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/LIKP0/UniFS.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly being integrated into computational social science research, yet their blackboxed training and designed stochastic elements in inference pose unique challenges for scientific inquiry. This article argues that applying LLMs to social scientific tasks requires explicit assessment of uncertainty-an expectation long established in both quantitative methodology in the social sciences and machine learning. We introduce a unified framework for evaluating LLM uncertainty along two dimensions: the task type (T), which distinguishes between classification, short-form, and long-form generation, and the validation type (V), which captures the availability of reference data or evaluative criteria. Drawing from both computer science and social science literature, we map existing uncertainty quantification (UQ) methods to this T-V typology and offer practical recommendations for researchers. Our framework provides both a methodological safeguard and a practical guide for integrating LLMs into rigorous social science research.",

This study investigates how universities and industries engage in shaping AI education and workforce preparation, drawing on survey responses from five African countries (Ghana, Namibia, Rwanda, Kenya and Zambia). The findings show broad recognition of AI importance but limited evidence of consistent engagement, practical training, or equitable access to resources. Most respondents who rated the AI component of their curriculum as very relevant reported being well prepared for jobs, but financial barriers, poor infrastructure, and weak communication limit participation, especially among students and underrepresented groups. Respondents highlighted internships, industry partnerships, and targeted support mechanisms as critical enablers, alongside the need for inclusive governance frameworks. The results showed both the growing awareness of AI's potential and the structural gaps that hinder its translation into workforce capacity. Strengthening university-industry collaboration and addressing barriers of access, funding, and policy are central to ensuring that AI contributes to equitable and sustainable development across the continent.",

This research presents a systematic framework for metadata enrichment using large language models (LLMs) to enhance document retrieval in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. Our approach employs a comprehensive, structured pipeline that dynamically generates meaningful metadata for document segments, substantially improving their semantic representations and retrieval accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we compare three chunking strategies-semantic, recursive, and naive-and evaluate their effectiveness when combined with advanced embedding techniques. The results demonstrate that metadata-enriched approaches consistently outperform content-only baselines, with recursive chunking paired with TF-IDF weighted embeddings yielding an 82.5% precision rate compared to 73.3% for semantic content-only approaches. The naive chunking strategy with prefix-fusion achieved the highest Hit Rate@10 of 0.925. Our evaluation employs cross-encoder reranking for ground truth generation, enabling rigorous assessment via Hit Rate and Metadata Consistency metrics. These findings confirm that metadata enrichment enhances vector clustering quality while reducing retrieval latency, making it a key optimization for RAG systems across knowledge domains. This work offers practical insights for deploying high-performance, scalable document retrieval solutions in enterprise settings, demonstrating that metadata enrichment is a powerful approach for enhancing RAG effectiveness.",

        "summary": "Major life transitions demand high-stakes decisions, yet people often struggle to imagine how their future selves will live with the consequences. To support this limited capacity for mental time travel, we introduce AI-enabled digital twins that have ``lived through'' simulated life scenarios. Rather than predicting optimal outcomes, these simulations extend prospective cognition by making alternative futures vivid enough to support deliberation without assuming which path is best. We evaluate this idea in a randomized controlled study (N=192) using multimodal synthesis - facial age progression, voice cloning, and large language model dialogue - to create personalized avatars representing participants 30 years forward. Young adults 18 to 28 years old described pending binary decisions and were assigned to guided imagination or one of four avatar conditions: single-option, balanced dual-option, or expanded three-option with a system-generated novel alternative. Results showed asymmetric effects: single-sided avatars increased shifts toward the presented option, while balanced presentation produced movement toward both. Introducing a system-generated third option increased adoption of this new alternative compared to control, suggesting that AI-generated future selves can expand choice by surfacing paths that might otherwise go unnoticed. Participants rated evaluative reasoning and eudaimonic meaning-making as more important than emotional or visual vividness. Perceived persuasiveness and baseline agency predicted decision change. These findings advance understanding of AI-mediated episodic prospection and raise questions about autonomy in AI-augmented decisions.",

        "summary": "Objective: Machine learning (ML) models are increasingly used to generate electrical stimulation patterns in neuroprosthetic devices such as visual prostheses. While these models promise precise and personalized control, they also introduce new safety risks when model outputs are delivered directly to neural tissue. We propose a systematic, quantitative approach to detect and characterize unsafe stimulation patterns in ML-driven neurostimulation systems. Approach: We adapt an automated software testing technique known as coverage-guided fuzzing to the domain of neural stimulation. Here, fuzzing performs stress testing by perturbing model inputs and tracking whether resulting stimulation violates biophysical limits on charge density, instantaneous current, or electrode co-activation. The framework treats encoders as black boxes and steers exploration with coverage metrics that quantify how broadly test cases span the space of possible outputs and violation types. Main results: Applied to deep stimulus encoders for the retina and cortex, the method systematically reveals diverse stimulation regimes that exceed established safety limits. Two violation-output coverage metrics identify the highest number and diversity of unsafe outputs, enabling interpretable comparisons across architectures and training strategies. Significance: Violation-focused fuzzing reframes safety assessment as an empirical, reproducible process. By transforming safety from a training heuristic into a measurable property of the deployed model, it establishes a foundation for evidence-based benchmarking, regulatory readiness, and ethical assurance in next-generation neural interfaces.",

Existing approaches predominantly rely on text or image prompts, which often fall short in geometric specificity: language can be ambiguous, and images are cumbersome to edit. In this work, we introduce SpaceControl, a training-free test-time method for explicit spatial control of 3D generation. Our approach accepts a wide range of geometric inputs, from coarse primitives to detailed meshes, and integrates seamlessly with modern pre-trained generative models without requiring any additional training. A controllable parameter lets users trade off between geometric fidelity and output realism. Extensive quantitative evaluation and user studies demonstrate that SpaceControl outperforms both training-based and optimization-based baselines in geometric faithfulness while preserving high visual quality. Finally, we present an interactive user interface that enables online editing of superquadrics for direct conversion into textured 3D assets, facilitating practical deployment in creative workflows.

We report on the industrial deployment of WhatsCode, a domain-specific AI development system that supports WhatsApp (serving over 2 billion users) and processes millions of lines of code across multiple platforms. Over 25 months (2023-2025), WhatsCode evolved from targeted privacy automation to autonomous agentic workflows integrated with end-to-end feature development and DevOps processes. WhatsCode achieved substantial quantifiable impact, improving automated privacy verification coverage 3.5x from 15% to 53%, identifying privacy requirements, and generating over 3,000 accepted code changes with acceptance rates ranging from 9% to 100% across different automation domains. The system committed 692 automated refactor/fix changes, 711 framework adoptions, 141 feature development assists and maintained 86% precision in bug triage. Our study identifies two stable human-AI collaboration patterns that emerged from production deployment: one-click rollout for high-confidence changes (60% of cases) and commandeer-revise for complex decisions (40%). We demonstrate that organizational factors, such as ownership models, adoption dynamics, and risk management, are as decisive as technical capabilities for enterprise-scale AI success.

        "summary": "Temporal understanding in autonomous driving (AD) remains a significant challenge, even for recent state-of-the-art (SoTA) Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has introduced datasets and benchmarks aimed at improving temporal reasoning, but these have emphasized other video content, including sports, cooking, and movies. No existing benchmark focuses exclusively on the unique challenges of temporal understanding in ego-centric AD footage. To fill this gap, the Temporal Understanding in Autonomous Driving (TAD) benchmark is presented, which evaluates VLMs' ability to capture the dynamic relationships between actions in AD. TAD comprises nearly 6,000 question-answer (QA) pairs, spanning 7 human-designed tasks. In addition, an evaluation is performed that consists of 9 closed- and open-source generalist models as well as SoTA AD specialist models. When applied to TAD, current SoTA models demonstrated substandard accuracies, largely due to imperfect fine-grained motion understanding. To improve motion understanding and overall accuracy on TAD, two novel training-free solutions are proposed: Scene-CoT, that leverages Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and TCogMap, which incorporates an ego-centric temporal cognitive map. The proposed approaches are integrated with existing VLMs and improve average accuracy on TAD by up to 17.72%. By introducing TAD, benchmarking multiple SoTA models, and proposing effective enhancements, this work aims to catalyze future research on temporal understanding in AD. The benchmark and evaluation code are available at \\href{https://huggingface.co/datasets/vbdai/TAD}{Hugging Face} and \\href{https://github.com/vbdi/tad_bench}{Github}, respectively.",

        "summary": "Reasoning from diverse observations is a fundamental capability for generalist robot policies to operate in a wide range of environments. Despite recent advancements, many large-scale robotic policies still remain sensitive to key sources of observational variation such as changes in camera perspective, lighting, and the presence of distractor objects. We posit that the limited generalizability of these models arises from the substantial diversity required to robustly cover these quasistatic axes, coupled with the current scarcity of large-scale robotic datasets that exhibit rich variation across them. In this work, we propose to systematically examine what robots need to generalize across these challenging axes by introducing two key auxiliary tasks, state similarity and invariance to observational perturbations, applied to both demonstration data and static visual data. We then show that via these auxiliary tasks, leveraging both more-expensive robotic demonstration data and less-expensive, visually rich synthetic images generated from non-physics-based simulation (for example, Unreal Engine) can lead to substantial increases in generalization to unseen camera viewpoints, lighting configurations, and distractor conditions. Our results demonstrate that co-training on this diverse data improves performance by 18 percent over existing generative augmentation methods.

Most often, LLMs are designed as \"general purpose\" technologies meant to represent the general population. Unfortunately, this often means alignment with predominantly Western Caucasian narratives and misalignment with other cultures and populations that engage in collaborative innovation. In response to this misalignment, there have been recent efforts centered on the development of \"culturally-informed\" LLMs, such as ChatBlackGPT, that are capable of better aligning with historically marginalized experiences and perspectives. Despite this progress, there has been little effort aimed at supporting our ability to develop and evaluate culturally-informed LLMs. A recent effort proposed an approach for developing a national alignment benchmark that emphasizes alignment with national social values and common knowledge. However, given the range of cultural identities present in the United States (U.S.), a national alignment benchmark is an ineffective goal for broader representation. To help fill this gap in this US context, we propose a replication study that translates the process used to develop KorNAT, a Korean National LLM alignment benchmark, to develop CIVIQ, a Cultural Intelligence and Values Inference Quality benchmark centered on alignment with community social values and common knowledge. Our work provides a critical foundation for research and development aimed at cultural alignment of AI technologies in practice.",

To tackle this problem, we introduce Enhanced Semantic Motion Representations (Semore), a new VLM-based framework for visual RL, which can simultaneously extract semantic and motion representations through a dual-path backbone from the RGB flows. Semore utilizes VLM with common-sense knowledge to retrieve key information from observations, while using the pre-trained clip to achieve the text-image alignment, thereby embedding the ground-truth representations into the backbone. To efficiently fuse semantic and motion representations for decision-making, our method adopts a separately supervised approach to simultaneously guide the extraction of semantics and motion, while allowing them to interact spontaneously. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, under the guidance of VLM at the feature level, our method exhibits efficient and adaptive ability compared to state-of-art methods. All codes are released.",

        "summary": "The increasing availability of Earth observation data offers unprecedented opportunities for large-scale environmental monitoring and analysis. However, these datasets are inherently heterogeneous, stemming from diverse sensors, geographical regions, acquisition times, and atmospheric conditions. Distribution shifts between training and deployment domains severely limit the generalization of pretrained remote sensing models, making unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) crucial for real-world applications. We introduce FlowEO, a novel framework that leverages generative models for image-space UDA in Earth observation. We leverage flow matching to learn a semantically preserving mapping that transports from the source to the target image distribution. This allows us to tackle challenging domain adaptation configurations for classification and semantic segmentation of Earth observation images. We conduct extensive experiments across four datasets covering adaptation scenarios such as SAR to optical translation and temporal and semantic shifts caused by natural disasters. Experimental results demonstrate that FlowEO outperforms existing image translation approaches for domain adaptation while achieving on-par or better perceptual image quality, highlighting the potential of flow-matching-based UDA for remote sensing.",

To address this, we introduce ChromouVQA, a large-scale, multi-task benchmark based on Ishihara-style chromatic camouflaged images. We extend classic dot plates with multiple fill geometries and vary chromatic separation, density, size, occlusion, and rotation, recording full metadata for reproducibility. The benchmark covers nine vision-question-answering tasks, including recognition, counting, comparison, and spatial reasoning. Evaluations of humans and VLMs reveal large gaps, especially under subtle chromatic contrast or disruptive geometric fills. We also propose a model-agnostic contrastive recipe aligning silhouettes with their camouflaged renderings, improving recovery of global shapes. ChromouVQA provides a compact, controlled benchmark for reproducible evaluation and extension. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Chromou-VQA-Benchmark/Chromou-VQA.",

        "summary": "Coronary artery disease (CAD) remains a major global health burden. Accurate identification of the culprit vessel and assessment of stenosis severity are essential for guiding individualized therapy. Although coronary CT angiography (CCTA) is the first-line non-invasive modality for CAD diagnosis, its dependence on high-end equipment, radiation exposure, and strict patient cooperation limits large-scale use. With advances in artificial intelligence (AI) and the widespread availability of electrocardiography (ECG), AI-ECG offers a promising alternative for CAD screening. In this study, we developed an interpretable AI-ECG model to predict severe or complete stenosis of the four major coronary arteries on CCTA. On the internal validation set, the model's AUCs for the right coronary artery (RCA), left main coronary artery (LM), left anterior descending artery (LAD), and left circumflex artery (LCX) were 0.794, 0.818, 0.744, and 0.755, respectively; on the external validation set, the AUCs reached 0.749, 0.971, 0.667, and 0.727, respectively. Performance remained stable in a clinically normal-ECG subset, indicating robustness beyond overt ECG abnormalities. Subgroup analyses across demographic and acquisition-time strata further confirmed model stability. Risk stratification based on vessel-specific incidence thresholds showed consistent separation on calibration and cumulative event curves. Interpretability analyses revealed distinct waveform differences between high- and low-risk groups, highlighting key electrophysiological regions contributing to model decisions and offering new insights into the ECG correlates of coronary stenosis.",

        "summary": "Zero-Shot Super-Resolution Spatiotemporal Forecasting requires a deep learning model to be trained on low-resolution data and deployed for inference on high-resolution. Existing studies consider maintaining similar error across different resolutions as indicative of successful multi-resolution generalization. However, deep learning models serving as alternatives to numerical solvers should reduce error as resolution increases. The fundamental limitation is, the upper bound of physical law frequencies that low-resolution data can represent is constrained by its Nyquist frequency, making it difficult for models to process signals containing unseen frequency components during high-resolution inference. This results in errors being anchored at low resolution, incorrectly interpreted as successful generalization. We define this fundamental phenomenon as a new problem distinct from existing issues: Scale Anchoring. Therefore, we propose architecture-agnostic Frequency Representation Learning. It alleviates Scale Anchoring through resolution-aligned frequency representations and spectral consistency training: on grids with higher Nyquist frequencies, the frequency response in high-frequency bands of FRL-enhanced variants is more stable. This allows errors to decrease with resolution and significantly outperform baselines within our task and resolution range, while incurring only modest computational overhead.",

        "summary": "Active 3D reconstruction enables an agent to autonomously select viewpoints to efficiently obtain accurate and complete scene geometry, rather than passively reconstructing scenes from pre-collected images. However, existing active reconstruction methods often rely on hand-crafted geometric heuristics, which can lead to redundant observations without substantially improving reconstruction quality. To address this limitation, we propose AREA3D, an active reconstruction agent that leverages feed-forward 3D reconstruction models and vision-language guidance. Our framework decouples view-uncertainty modeling from the underlying feed-forward reconstructor, enabling precise uncertainty estimation without expensive online optimization. In addition, an integrated vision-language model provides high-level semantic guidance, encouraging informative and diverse viewpoints beyond purely geometric cues. Extensive experiments on both scene-level and object-level benchmarks demonstrate that AREA3D achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction accuracy, particularly in the sparse-view regime.

Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective countermeasures. In this paper, we utilize a two-times-two patch antenna system (i.e., the software defined radio device Ettus USRP X440) to predict the angle, elevation, and distance to the jamming source based on in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples. We propose to use an inertial measurement unit (IMU) attached to the antenna system to predict the relative movement of the antenna in dynamic scenarios. We present a synthetic aperture system that enables coherent spatial imaging using platform motion to synthesize larger virtual apertures, offering superior angular resolution without mechanically rotating antennas. While classical angle-of-arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors, we utilize a methodology that fuses IQ and Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms with 22 AoA features and the predicted relative movement to enhance GNSS jammer direction finding.",

        "summary": "Enterprises grapple with the significant challenge of managing proprietary unstructured data, hindering efficient information retrieval. This has led to the emergence of AI-driven information retrieval solutions, designed to adeptly extract relevant insights to address employee inquiries. These solutions often leverage pre-trained embedding models and generative models as foundational components. While pre-trained embeddings may exhibit proximity or disparity based on their original training objectives, they might not fully align with the unique characteristics of enterprise-specific data, leading to suboptimal alignment with the retrieval goals of enterprise environments. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive methodology for contextualizing pre-trained embedding models to enterprise environments, covering the entire process from data preparation to model fine-tuning and evaluation. By adapting the embeddings to better suit the retrieval tasks prevalent in enterprises, we aim to enhance the performance of information retrieval solutions. We discuss the process of fine-tuning, its effect on retrieval accuracy, and the potential benefits for enterprise information management. Our findings demonstrate the efficacy of fine-tuned embedding models in improving the precision and relevance of search results in enterprise settings.",
