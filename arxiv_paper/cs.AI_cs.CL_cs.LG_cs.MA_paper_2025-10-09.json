        "summary": "Multi-agent systems (MAS) solve complex problems through coordinated autonomous entities with individual decision-making capabilities. While Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) enables these agents to learn intelligent strategies, it faces challenges of non-stationarity and partial observability. Communications among agents offer a solution, but questions remain about its optimal structure and evaluation. This paper explores two underexamined aspects: communication topology and information efficiency. We demonstrate that directed and sequential topologies improve performance while reducing communication overhead across both homogeneous and heterogeneous tasks. Additionally, we introduce two metrics -- Information Entropy Efficiency Index (IEI) and Specialization Efficiency Index (SEI) -- to evaluate message compactness and role differentiation. Incorporating these metrics into training objectives improves success rates and convergence speed. Our findings highlight that designing adaptive communication topologies with information-efficient messaging is essential for effective coordination in complex MAS.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being deployed as autonomous agents in real-world environments. As these deployments scale, multi-agent interactions become inevitable, making it essential to understand strategic behavior in such systems. A central open question is whether LLM agents, like reinforcement learning agents, can shape the learning dynamics and influence the behavior of others through interaction alone. In this paper, we present the first investigation of opponent shaping (OS) with LLM-based agents. Existing OS algorithms cannot be directly applied to LLMs, as they require higher-order derivatives, face scalability constraints, or depend on architectural components that are absent in transformers. To address this gap, we introduce ShapeLLM, an adaptation of model-free OS methods tailored for transformer-based agents. Using ShapeLLM, we examine whether LLM agents can influence co-players' learning dynamics across diverse game-theoretic environments. We demonstrate that LLM agents can successfully guide opponents toward exploitable equilibria in competitive games (Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, Matching Pennies, and Chicken) and promote coordination and improve collective welfare in cooperative games (Iterated Stag Hunt and a cooperative version of the Prisoner's Dilemma). Our findings show that LLM agents can both shape and be shaped through interaction, establishing opponent shaping as a key dimension of multi-agent LLM research.",

However, it remains unclear how should learners optimally incorporate certain forms of expert data, which may differ in structure from the learner's own action-outcome experiences. We study this problem in the context of Bayesian multi-armed bandits, considering: (i) offline settings, where the learner receives a dataset of outcomes from the expert's optimal policy before interaction, and (ii) simultaneous settings, where the learner must choose at each step whether to update its beliefs based on its own experience, or based on the outcome simultaneously achieved by an expert. We formalize how expert data influences the learner's posterior, and prove that pretraining on expert outcomes tightens information-theoretic regret bounds by the mutual information between the expert data and the optimal action. For the simultaneous setting, we propose an information-directed rule where the learner processes the data source that maximizes their one-step information gain about the optimal action. Finally, we propose strategies for how the learner can infer when to trust the expert and when not to, safeguarding the learner for the cases where the expert is ineffective or compromised. By quantifying the value of expert data, our framework provides practical, information-theoretic algorithms for agents to intelligently decide when to learn from others.",

We present a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework that integrates a high-fidelity, highly efficient climate surrogate directly in the environment loop, enabling regional agents to learn climate policies under multi-gas dynamics. As a proof of concept, we introduce a recurrent neural network architecture pretrained on ($20{,}000$) multi-gas emission pathways to surrogate the climate model CICERO-SCM. The surrogate model attains near-simulator accuracy with global-mean temperature RMSE $\\approx 0.0004 \\mathrm{K}$ and approximately $1000\\times$ faster one-step inference. When substituted for the original simulator in a climate-policy MARL setting, it accelerates end-to-end training by $>\\!100\\times$. We show that the surrogate and simulator converge to the same optimal policies and propose a methodology to assess this property in cases where using the simulator is intractable. Our work allows to bypass the core computational bottleneck without sacrificing policy fidelity, enabling large-scale multi-agent experiments across alternative climate-policy regimes with multi-gas dynamics and high-fidelity climate response.",

Despite advances in large language and vision-language models that enable agents to act autonomously and pursue goals in rich settings, their ability to reason about safety, coherence, and trust across modalities remains limited. We introduce a reproducible simulation framework for evaluating agents along three dimensions: (1) safety improvement over time, including iterative plan revisions in text-visual scenarios; (2) detection of unsafe activities across multiple categories of social situations; and (3) social dynamics, measured as interaction counts and acceptance ratios of social exchanges. Agents are equipped with layered memory, dynamic planning, multimodal perception, and are instrumented with SocialMetrics, a suite of behavioral and structural metrics that quantifies plan revisions, unsafe-to-safe conversions, and information diffusion across networks. Experiments show that while agents can detect direct multimodal contradictions, they often fail to align local revisions with global safety, reaching only a 55 percent success rate in correcting unsafe plans. Across eight simulation runs with three models - Claude, GPT-4o mini, and Qwen-VL - five agents achieved average unsafe-to-safe conversion rates of 75, 55, and 58 percent, respectively. Overall performance ranged from 20 percent in multi-risk scenarios with GPT-4o mini to 98 percent in localized contexts such as fire/heat with Claude. Notably, 45 percent of unsafe actions were accepted when paired with misleading visuals, showing a strong tendency to overtrust images. These findings expose critical limitations in current architectures and provide a reproducible platform for studying multimodal safety, coherence, and social dynamics.",

        "summary": "Multi-agent debate (MAD) aims to improve large language model (LLM) reasoning by letting multiple agents exchange answers and then aggregate their opinions. Yet recent studies reveal that agents are not neutral: they are prone to identity-driven sycophancy and self-bias, uncritically adopting a peer's view or stubbornly adhering to their own prior output, undermining the reliability of debate. In this work, we present the first principled framework that joins sycophancy and self-bias to mitigate and quantify identity bias in MAD. First, we formalize the debate dynamics as an identity-weighted Bayesian update process. Second, we propose response anonymization: by removing identity markers from prompts, agents cannot distinguish \"self\" from \"peer\", which forces equal weights on agent identity, thereby reducing bias. Third, we define the Identity Bias Coefficient (IBC), a principled metric that measures how often an agent follows a peer versus itself. Empirical studies across multiple models, datasets and debate rounds confirm that identity bias is widespread, with sycophancy far more common than self-bias. Our findings highlight the need to \"mask\" identity to ensure that MAD systems reason based on content rather than source identity.

We introduce ArenaBencher, a model-agnostic framework for automatic benchmark evolution that updates test cases while preserving comparability. Given an existing benchmark and a diverse pool of models to be evaluated, ArenaBencher infers the core ability of each test case, generates candidate question-answer pairs that preserve the original objective, verifies correctness and intent with an LLM as a judge, and aggregates feedback from multiple models to select candidates that expose shared weaknesses. The process runs iteratively with in-context demonstrations that steer generation toward more challenging and diagnostic cases. We apply ArenaBencher to math problem solving, commonsense reasoning, and safety domains and show that it produces verified, diverse, and fair updates that uncover new failure modes, increase difficulty while preserving test objective alignment, and improve model separability. The framework provides a scalable path to continuously evolve benchmarks in step with the rapid progress of foundation models.",

        "summary": "Self-evolution is a central research topic in enabling large language model (LLM)-based agents to continually improve their capabilities after pretraining. Recent research has witnessed a transition from reinforcement learning (RL)-free to RL-based methods. Current RL-based methods either rely on dense external reward signals or extract intrinsic reward signals from LLMs themselves. However, these approaches diverge from the self-evolution mechanisms observed in human intelligence, where individuals learn and improve through mutual discussion and collaboration. In this work, we introduce Co-Evolving Multi-Agent Systems (CoMAS), a novel framework that enables agents to improve autonomously by learning from inter-agent interactions without external supervision. CoMAS generates intrinsic rewards from rich discussion dynamics, employs an LLM-as-a-judge mechanism to formulate these rewards, and optimizes each agent's policy through RL, thereby enabling decentralized and scalable co-evolution. Experimental results demonstrate that CoMAS consistently outperforms untrained agents and achieves state-of-the-art performance across most evaluation settings. Ablation studies confirm the necessity of interaction-based reward signals and reveal promising scalability as the number and diversity of agents increase. These findings establish CoMAS as a novel and effective paradigm for self-evolution in LLM-based agents.",

        "summary": "Reasoning large language models exhibit complex reasoning behaviors through the extended chain-of-thought generation, creating unprecedented Key-Value (KV) cache overhead during the decoding phase. Existing KV cache compression methods underperform on reasoning models: token-dropping methods break reasoning integrity by discarding critical information, while head-reallocating methods mistakenly compress reasoning-critical heads since they are designed for retrieval tasks, resulting in significant performance degradation as compression rates increase. We hypothesize that KV heads exhibit functional heterogeneity in reasoning models-some heads are critical for chain-of-thought consistency while others are compressible. To validate and exploit this insight, we propose RLKV, a novel reasoning-critical head identification framework, which uses reinforcement learning to directly optimize the relationship between each head's cache usage and reasoning quality. As RLKV produces rewards from actual generated samples during training, it naturally identifies heads relevant to reasoning behaviors. We then allocate full KV cache to these heads while applying compressed constant KV cache to others for efficient inference. Our experiments reveal that only a small fraction of attention heads is essential for reasoning, enabling our KV compression approach to outperform baseline methods while achieving 20-50% cache reduction with near lossless performance compared to uncompressed results.",

This method introduces a new word by adding a new word embedding and training with examples that exhibit the concept with no other changes in model parameters. We show that adding a new word allows for control of concepts such as flattery, incorrect answers, text length, as well as more complex concepts in AxBench. We discover that neologisms can also further our understanding of the model via self-verbalization: models can describe what each new word means to them in natural language, like explaining that a word that represents a concept of incorrect answers means ``a lack of complete, coherent, or meaningful answers...'' To validate self-verbalizations, we introduce plug-in evaluation: we insert the verbalization into the context of a model and measure whether it controls the target concept. In some self-verbalizations, we find machine-only synonyms: words that seem unrelated to humans but cause similar behavior in machines.

To address this critical efficiency bottleneck, we propose DeepPrune, a novel framework that enables efficient parallel scaling through dynamic pruning. Our method features a specialized judge model trained with focal loss and oversampling techniques to accurately predict answer equivalence from partial reasoning traces which realizes 0.87 AUROC on equivalence prediction, combined with an online greedy clustering algorithm that dynamically prunes redundant paths while preserving answer diversity. Comprehensive evaluations across three challenging benchmarks (AIME 2024, AIME 2025, and GPQA) and multiple reasoning models demonstrate that DeepPrune achieves remarkable token reduction by over 80% compared to conventional consensus sampling on most cases, while maintaining competitive accuracy within 3 percentage points.

The LEWIDI series of shared tasks on Learning With Disagreements was established to promote this approach to training and evaluating AI models, by making suitable datasets more accessible and by developing evaluation methods. The third edition of the task builds on this goal by extending the LEWIDI benchmark to four datasets spanning paraphrase identification, irony detection, sarcasm detection, and natural language inference, with labeling schemes that include not only categorical judgments as in previous editions, but ordinal judgments as well. Another novelty is that we adopt two complementary paradigms to evaluate disagreement-aware systems: the soft-label approach, in which models predict population-level distributions of judgments, and the perspectivist approach, in which models predict the interpretations of individual annotators. Crucially, we moved beyond standard metrics such as cross-entropy, and tested new evaluation metrics for the two paradigms. The task attracted diverse participation, and the results provide insights into the strengths and limitations of methods to modeling variation. Together, these contributions strengthen LEWIDI as a framework and provide new resources, benchmarks, and findings to support the development of disagreement-aware technologies.",

However, these models tend to overthink on simple problems, producing unnecessarily lengthy reasoning traces, while under-exploring on challenging ones, leading to missed solutions. To address this imbalance, we propose ARES, a unified open-source framework for adaptive reasoning that dynamically allocates exploration effort based on task difficulty. Our approach is motivated by two key empirical findings: (i) while single-token entropy is noisy, high window-entropy (HWE) tokens (token-level entropies averaged under a sliding window) can reliably capture reasoning-critical moments; and (ii) reducing HWE usage benefits easy problems, while increasing it is essential for solving hard ones. Building on these insights, ARES introduces a two-stage training pipeline. In the Adaptive Cold-Start stage, we curate multimodal and textual data paired with reasoning traces of length proportional to problem difficulty, equipping the model with initial difficulty awareness. In the second stage, we develop Adaptive Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which uses HWE tokens as exploration triggers to decide when to explore, and a hierarchical entropy reward with dynamic KL control to decide how much to explore. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ARES achieves superior performance and reasoning efficiency across diverse mathematical, logical, and multimodal benchmarks, while closing the gap to leading commercial systems under significantly lower inference costs.",

It plays an important role in communication and reasoning, as it influences how individuals interpret implications, assess arguments, and make decisions based on hypothetical scenarios. When humans evaluate how acceptable a conditional \"If A, then B\" is, their judgments are influenced by two main factors: the $\\textit{conditional probability}$ of $B$ given $A$, and the $\\textit{semantic relevance}$ of the antecedent $A$ given the consequent $B$ (i.e., whether $A$ meaningfully supports $B$). While prior work has examined how large language models (LLMs) draw inferences about conditional statements, it remains unclear how these models judge the $\\textit{acceptability}$ of such statements. To address this gap, we present a comprehensive study of LLMs' conditional acceptability judgments across different model families, sizes, and prompting strategies. Using linear mixed-effects models and ANOVA tests, we find that models are sensitive to both conditional probability and semantic relevance-though to varying degrees depending on architecture and prompting style. A comparison with human data reveals that while LLMs incorporate probabilistic and semantic cues, they do so less consistently than humans. Notably, larger models do not necessarily align more closely with human judgments.",

        "summary": "In-context learning (ICL) is the ability of a large language model (LLM) to learn a new task from a few demonstrations presented as part of the context. Past studies have attributed a large portion of the success of ICL to the way these in-context demonstrations are represented, particularly to how labels are represented in classification tasks. On the other hand, observations of the learning capacity of ICL (i.e., the extent to which more in-context demonstrations can lead to higher performance) have been mixed, and ICL is often thought to occur only under specific conditions. The interaction between these two aspects in ICL, representation and learning, has not been studied in depth until now. We hypothesize that they are largely independent of one another, such that the representation of demonstrations determines the baseline accuracy of ICL, while learning from additional demonstrations improves only on top of this baseline. We validate this hypothesis by developing an optimization algorithm that can enumerate a spectrum of possible label sets (representations) varying in semantic relevance. We then perform ICL with varying numbers of in-context demonstrations for each of these label sets. We observed that learning happens regardless of the quality of the label set itself, although its efficiency, measured by the slope of improvement over in-context demonstrations, is conditioned on both the label set quality and the parameter count of the underlying language model. Despite the emergence of learning, the relative quality (accuracy) of the choice of a label set (representation) is largely maintained throughout learning, confirming our hypothesis and implying their orthogonality. Our work reveals a previously underexplored aspect of ICL: the independent effects of learning from demonstrations and their representations on ICL performance.",

        "summary": "Suicide rates have risen worldwide in recent years, underscoring the urgent need for proactive prevention strategies. Social media provides valuable signals, as many at-risk individuals - who often avoid formal help due to stigma - choose instead to share their distress online. Yet detecting implicit suicidal ideation, conveyed indirectly through metaphor, sarcasm, or subtle emotional cues, remains highly challenging. Lightweight models like BERT handle explicit signals but fail on subtle implicit ones, while large language models (LLMs) capture nuance at prohibitive computational cost. To address this gap, we propose a two-stage voting architecture that balances efficiency and robustness. In Stage 1, a lightweight BERT classifier rapidly resolves high-confidence explicit cases. In Stage 2, ambiguous inputs are escalated to either (i) a multi-perspective LLM voting framework to maximize recall on implicit ideation, or (ii) a feature-based ML ensemble guided by psychologically grounded indicators extracted via prompt-engineered LLMs for efficiency and interpretability. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first works to operationalize LLM-extracted psychological features as structured vectors for suicide risk detection. On two complementary datasets - explicit-dominant Reddit and implicit-only DeepSuiMind - our framework outperforms single-model baselines, achieving 98.0% F1 on explicit cases, 99.7% on implicit ones, and reducing the cross-domain gap below 2%, while significantly lowering LLM cost.",

AutoRed operates in two stages: (1) persona-guided adversarial instruction generation, and (2) a reflection loop to iteratively refine low-quality prompts. To improve efficiency, we introduce a verifier to assess prompt harmfulness without querying the target models. Using AutoRed, we build two red teaming datasets -- AutoRed-Medium and AutoRed-Hard -- and evaluate eight state-of-the-art LLMs. AutoRed achieves higher attack success rates and better generalization than existing baselines. Our results highlight the limitations of seed-based approaches and demonstrate the potential of free-form red teaming for LLM safety evaluation. We will open source our datasets in the near future.",

However, LLMs exhibit cultural bias and limited awareness of underrepresented cultures, while the mechanisms underlying their cultural understanding remain underexplored. To fill this gap, we conduct a neuron-level analysis to identify neurons that drive cultural behavior, introducing a gradient-based scoring method with additional filtering for precise refinement. We identify both culture-general neurons contributing to cultural understanding regardless of cultures, and culture-specific neurons tied to an individual culture. These neurons account for less than 1% of all neurons and are concentrated in shallow to middle MLP layers. We validate their role by showing that suppressing them substantially degrades performance on cultural benchmarks (by up to 30%), while performance on general natural language understanding (NLU) benchmarks remains largely unaffected. Moreover, we show that culture-specific neurons support knowledge of not only the target culture, but also related cultures. Finally, we demonstrate that training on NLU benchmarks can diminish models' cultural understanding when we update modules containing many culture-general neurons. These findings provide insights into the internal mechanisms of LLMs and offer practical guidance for model training and engineering. Our code is available at https://github.com/ynklab/CULNIG",

DeepMiner presents a reverse construction method to generate complex but verifiable question-answer pairs from authentic web sources, which ensures the challenge and reliability of training data while injecting cognitive capabilities into multi-turn reasoning scenarios. We further design an elegant yet effective dynamic context management strategy for both training and inference, utilizing sliding window mechanisms while eliminating the dependency on external summarization models, thereby efficiently empowering the model to handle continuously expanding long-horizon contexts. Through reinforcement learning on Qwen3-32B, we develop DeepMiner-32B, which achieves substantial performance improvements across multiple search agent benchmarks. DeepMiner attains 33.5% accuracy on BrowseComp-en, surpassing the previous best open-source agent by almost 20 percentage points, and demonstrates consistent improvements on BrowseComp-zh, XBench-DeepSearch, and GAIA. Notably, our dynamic context management enables sustained interactions of nearly 100 turns within standard 32k context length, effectively addressing the context limitations that constrain existing multi-turn interaction systems.",

A potential solution is to train on synthetic data sampled from LLMs. In this work, we build on this idea and investigate the benefits of contrastive decoding for generating synthetic corpora. In a controlled setting, we experiment with sampling corpora using the relative difference between a good and bad model trained on the same original corpus of 100 million words. By amplifying the signal from a model that has better performance, we create a synthetic corpus and mix it with the original training data. Our findings show that training on a mixture of synthesized and real data improves performance on the language modeling objective and a range of downstream tasks. In particular, we see that training with a mix of synthetic data from contrastive decoding benefits tasks that require more reasoning skills, while synthetic data from traditional sampling helps more on tasks dependent on surface level linguistic capabilities.",

        "summary": "Harnessing the power of LLMs requires a delicate dance between being helpful and harmless. This creates a fundamental tension between two competing challenges: vulnerability to adversarial attacks that elicit unsafe content, and a tendency for overrefusal on benign but sensitive prompts. Current approaches often navigate this dance with safeguard models that completely reject any content that contains unsafe portions. This approach cuts the music entirely-it may exacerbate overrefusals and fails to provide nuanced guidance for queries it refuses. To teach models a more coordinated choreography, we propose WaltzRL, a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates safety alignment as a collaborative, positive-sum game. WaltzRL jointly trains a conversation agent and a feedback agent, where the latter is incentivized to provide useful suggestions that improve the safety and helpfulness of the conversation agent's responses. At the core of WaltzRL is a Dynamic Improvement Reward (DIR) that evolves over time based on how well the conversation agent incorporates the feedback. At inference time, unsafe or overrefusing responses from the conversation agent are improved rather than discarded. The feedback agent is deployed together with the conversation agent and only engages adaptively when needed, preserving helpfulness and low latency on safe queries. Our experiments, conducted across five diverse datasets, demonstrate that WaltzRL significantly reduces both unsafe responses (e.g., from 39.0% to 4.6% on WildJailbreak) and overrefusals (from 45.3% to 9.9% on OR-Bench) compared to various baselines. By enabling the conversation and feedback agents to co-evolve and adaptively apply feedback, WaltzRL enhances LLM safety without degrading general capabilities, thereby advancing the Pareto front between helpfulness and harmlessness.",

We address this shortcoming by developing a new dataset that integrates concausality. Based on an extensive literature review, we first show that concausality is an integral part of causal reasoning on incomplete knowledge. We operationalize this theory in the form of a rigorous guideline for annotation and then augment the Causal News Corpus with concausal statements, obtaining a substantial inter-annotator agreement of Cohen's $\\kappa=0.74$. To demonstrate the importance of integrating concausal statements, we show that models trained without concausal relationships tend to misclassify these as procausal instead. Based on our new dataset, this mistake can be mitigated, enabling transformers to effectively distinguish pro- and concausality.",

In this paper, we introduce SenWave, a novel fine-grained multi-language sentiment analysis dataset specifically designed for analyzing COVID-19 tweets, featuring ten sentiment categories across five languages.

Additionally, it includes over 105 million unlabeled tweets collected during various COVID-19 waves. To enable accurate fine-grained sentiment classification, we fine-tuned pre-trained transformer-based language models using the labeled tweets. Our study provides an in-depth analysis of the evolving emotional landscape across languages, countries, and topics, revealing significant insights over time. Furthermore, we assess the compatibility of our dataset with ChatGPT, demonstrating its robustness and versatility in various applications.

In this work, we investigate whether this phenomenon can extend beyond safety behaviors to a broader spectrum of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios (e.g., lying under pressure and deceptive behavior). To explore this, we finetune open-sourced LLMs on misaligned completions across diverse domains. Experimental results demonstrate that LLMs show broadly misaligned behavior in dishonesty. Additionally, we further explore this phenomenon in a downstream combined finetuning setting, and find that introducing as little as 1% of misalignment data into a standard downstream task is sufficient to decrease honest behavior over 20%. Furthermore, we consider a more practical human-AI interaction environment where we simulate both benign and biased users to interact with the assistant LLM. Notably, we find that the assistant can be misaligned unintentionally to exacerbate its dishonesty with only 10% biased user population. In summary, we extend the study of emergent misalignment to the domain of dishonesty and deception under high-stakes scenarios, and demonstrate that this risk arises not only through direct finetuning, but also in downstream mixture tasks and practical human-AI interactions.",

However, the mechanisms of memory retrieval and consolidation in LLMs remain poorly understood. In this paper, we propose the function token hypothesis to explain the workings of LLMs: During inference, function tokens activate the most predictive features from context and govern next token prediction (memory retrieval). During pre-training, predicting the next tokens (usually content tokens) that follow function tokens increases the number of learned features of LLMs and updates the model parameters (memory consolidation). Function tokens here roughly correspond to function words in linguistics, including punctuation marks, articles, prepositions, and conjunctions, in contrast to content tokens. We provide extensive experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis. Using bipartite graph analysis, we show that a small number of function tokens activate the majority of features. Case studies further reveal how function tokens activate the most predictive features from context to direct next token prediction. We also find that during pre-training, the training loss is dominated by predicting the next content tokens following function tokens, which forces the function tokens to select the most predictive features from context.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Model (LLM) agents have demonstrated their promising general capabilities. However, their performance in specialized real-world domains often degrades due to challenges in effectively integrating external tools and specific prompting strategies. While methods like agentic reinforcement learning have been proposed to address this, they typically rely on costly parameter updates, for example, through a process that uses Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed by a Reinforcement Learning (RL) phase with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to alter the output distribution. However, we argue that LLMs can achieve a similar effect on the output distribution by learning experiential knowledge as a token prior, which is a far more lightweight approach that not only addresses practical data scarcity but also avoids the common issue of overfitting. To this end, we propose Training-Free Group Relative Policy Optimization (Training-Free GRPO), a cost-effective solution that enhances LLM agent performance without any parameter updates. Our method leverages the group relative semantic advantage instead of numerical ones within each group of rollouts, iteratively distilling high-quality experiential knowledge during multi-epoch learning on a minimal ground-truth data. Such knowledge serves as the learned token prior, which is seamlessly integrated during LLM API calls to guide model behavior. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and web searching tasks demonstrate that Training-Free GRPO, when applied to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, significantly improves out-of-domain performance. With just a few dozen training samples, Training-Free GRPO outperforms fine-tuned small LLMs with marginal training data and cost.",

In this paper, we present ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared to long CoT.

We address this challenge by introducing two comprehensive benchmarks: the Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (XSB) for single-turn prompts, annotated with \"Focus\" keywords that identify refusal-inducing triggers, and the Multi-turn Scenario-based Exaggerated Safety Benchmark (MS-XSB), which systematically evaluates refusal calibration in realistic, context-rich dialog settings. Our benchmarks reveal that exaggerated refusals persist across diverse recent LLMs and are especially pronounced in complex, multi-turn scenarios. To mitigate these failures, we leverage post-hoc explanation methods to identify refusal triggers and deploy three lightweight, model-agnostic approaches, ignore-word instructions, prompt rephrasing, and attention steering, at inference time, all without retraining or parameter access. Experiments on four instruction-tuned Llama models demonstrate that these strategies substantially improve compliance on safe prompts while maintaining robust safety protections. Our findings establish a reproducible framework for diagnosing and mitigating exaggerated refusals, highlighting practical pathways to safer and more helpful LLM deployments.",

        "summary": "The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled their adoption in real-world industrial scenarios for various natural language processing tasks. However, the high inference cost of large-scale LLMs makes their deployment impractical, necessitating the use of smaller models. Despite their efficiency, smaller LLMs lack robust zero-shot instruction-following capabilities across diverse domains, limiting their adaptability to dynamic user requirements. Traditional fine-tuning approaches exacerbate this issue by inducing catastrophic forgetting, reducing the model's generalization ability for unseen tasks. In this paper, we propose Domain Adaptive Continual Instruction Pre-Training via Reading Comprehension (DACIP-RC), a continual pre-training technique that enhances smaller LLMs' domain adaptability for business conversational tasks. Unlike conventional pre-training approaches that rely on next-token prediction, DACIP-RC generates diverse task instructions and responses via reading comprehension on conversation transcripts, enabling better instruction generalization. Our empirical evaluations demonstrate that DACIP-RC significantly improves zero-shot generalization across a wide range of business conversational tasks, including meeting summarization, action item generation, and call purpose identification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to apply instruction pre-training on business conversational data, providing insights into how industries can leverage proprietary datasets for domain adaptation.",

To this end, we introduce AI Knowledge Assist, a system that extracts knowledge in the form of question-answer (QA) pairs from historical customer-agent conversations to automatically build a knowledge base. Fine-tuning a lightweight LLM on internal data demonstrates state-of-the-art performance, outperforming larger closed-source LLMs. More specifically, empirical evaluation on 20 companies demonstrates that the proposed AI Knowledge Assist system that leverages the LLaMA-3.1-8B model eliminates the cold-start gap in contact centers by achieving above 90% accuracy in answering information-seeking questions.

This approach plays a vital role in aligning LLMs with human judgments, providing accurate and reliable assessments. However, LLM-based judgment models often exhibit judgment preference bias during the evaluation phase, tending to favor responses generated by themselves, undermining the reliability of their judgments. This paper introduces the Group-Based Polling Optimization (Genii), an unsupervised multi-agent collaborative optimization framework that mitigates the inherent judgment preference bias of judgment models. Specifically, Genii integrates various LLM-based judgment models into a multi-agent system and simulates the interactive client-server polling mechanism to optimize each client agent unsupervisedly. Our experiments demonstrate that Genii outperforms supervised models trained on annotated judgment data, while requiring no human-labeled annotations. Genii consistently improves performance across different client agents during the polling, even when weaker models act as server agents. Further analysis reveals that Genii effectively mitigates judgment preference bias of LLM-based judgment models, demonstrating its effectiveness.

As such, it is imperative that we understand the potential biases and risks of doing so. In this work, we propose an approach for extracting high-level concept-based global policies from LLM-as-a-Judge. Our approach consists of two algorithms: 1) CLoVE (Contrastive Local Verifiable Explanations), which generates verifiable, concept-based, contrastive local explanations and 2) GloVE (Global Verifiable Explanations), which uses iterative clustering, summarization and verification to condense local rules into a global policy. We evaluate GloVE on seven standard benchmarking datasets for content harm detection. We find that the extracted global policies are highly faithful to decisions of the LLM-as-a-Judge. Additionally, we evaluated the robustness of global policies to text perturbations and adversarial attacks. Finally, we conducted a user study to evaluate user understanding and satisfaction with global policies.",

Effective regulation requires applying legal knowledge with a clear purpose and reason, yet current detection methods of undisclosed sponsored content generally lack legal grounding or operate as opaque \"black boxes\". Using 1,143 Instagram posts, we compare gpt-5-nano and gemini-2.5-flash-lite under three prompting strategies with controlled levels of legal knowledge provided. Both models perform strongly in classifying content as sponsored or not (F1 up to 0.93), though performance drops by over 10 points on ambiguous cases. We further develop a taxonomy of reasoning errors, showing frequent citation omissions (28.57%), unclear references (20.71%), and hidden ads exhibiting the highest miscue rate (28.57%). While adding regulatory text to the prompt improves explanation quality, it does not consistently improve detection accuracy. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, it makes a novel addition to regulatory compliance technology by providing a taxonomy of common errors in LLM-generated legal reasoning to evaluate whether automated moderation is not only accurate but also legally robust, thereby advancing the transparent detection of influencer marketing content. Second, it features an original dataset of LLM explanations annotated by two students who were trained in influencer marketing law. Third, it combines quantitative and qualitative evaluation strategies for LLM explanations and critically reflects on how these findings can support advertising regulatory bodies in automating moderation processes on a solid legal foundation.",

Particularly, auto-regressive language models generate texts token by token, i.e., by predicting the next-token distribution given the previous ones, and thus tokenization directly affects their efficiency in text generation. Since each language model has their own vocabulary as a set of possible tokens, they struggle to cooperate with each other at the level of next-token distributions such as model ensemble. In this paper, we establish a theoretical framework of lossless vocabulary reduction, which efficiently converts a given auto-regressive language model into the one with an arbitrarily small vocabulary without any loss in accuracy. As an application, we demonstrate that language models with different tokenization can cooperate with each other efficiently through their maximal common vocabulary.",

Using a self-play setup across three diverse dialogue games, we analyse trade-offs between performance and cost, the language consistency of reasoning processes, and the nature of strategic adaptation exhibited by models. Our findings show that enabling reasoning-that is, scaling test time compute-significantly improves negotiation outcomes by enhancing collaboration and helping models overcome task complexities, but comes at a substantial computational cost: reasoning improves GPT-5's performance by 31.4 % while increasing its cost by nearly 400 %. Most critically, we uncover a significant multilingual reasoning distinction: open-weight models consistently switch to English for their internal reasoning steps, even when negotiating in German or Italian (and thus possibly impacting potential explainability gains through the disclosure of reasoning traces), while leading commercial models maintain language consistency between their reasoning and final output.",

However, existing methods often suffer from overfitting under limited client data and tend to forget global information after multiple training rounds, leading to poor generalization. To address these issues, we propose FedDTRE, a Federated adaptive aggregation strategy for Dialogue generation based on Trustworthiness Evaluation. Instead of directly replacing local models with the global model, FedDTRE leverages trustworthiness scores of both global and local models on a fairness-oriented evaluation dataset to dynamically regulate the global model's contribution during local updates. Experimental results demonstrate that FedDTRE can improve dialogue model performance and enhance the quality of dialogue generation.",

Despite growing adoption, the capacity of LLMs to recall climate normals from parametric knowledge remains largely uncharacterized. We investigate the capacity of contemporary LLMs to recall climate normals without external retrieval, focusing on a prototypical query: mean July 2-m air temperature 1991-2020 at specified locations. We construct a global grid of queries at 1{\\deg} resolution land points, providing coordinates and location descriptors, and validate responses against ERA5 reanalysis. Results show that LLMs encode non-trivial climate structure, capturing latitudinal and topographic patterns, with root-mean-square errors of 3-6 {\\deg}C and biases of $\\pm$1 {\\deg}C. However, spatially coherent errors remain, particularly in mountains and high latitudes. Performance degrades sharply above 1500 m, where RMSE reaches 5-13 {\\deg}C compared to 2-4 {\\deg}C at lower elevations. We find that including geographic context (country, city, region) reduces errors by 27% on average, with larger models being most sensitive to location descriptors. While models capture the global mean magnitude of observed warming between 1950-1974 and 2000-2024, they fail to reproduce spatial patterns of temperature change, which directly relate to assessing climate change. This limitation highlights that while LLMs may capture present-day climate distributions, they struggle to represent the regional and local expression of long-term shifts in temperature essential for understanding climate dynamics. Our evaluation framework provides a reproducible benchmark for quantifying parametric climate knowledge in LLMs and complements existing climate communication assessments.",

Existing LLM agents suffer from a critical limitation: they are test-time static and cannot learn from experience, lacking the ability to accumulate knowledge and continuously improve on the job. To address this challenge, we propose MUSE, a novel agent framework that introduces an experience-driven, self-evolving system centered around a hierarchical Memory Module. MUSE organizes diverse levels of experience and leverages them to plan and execute long-horizon tasks across multiple applications. After each sub-task execution, the agent autonomously reflects on its trajectory, converting the raw trajectory into structured experience and integrating it back into the Memory Module. This mechanism enables the agent to evolve beyond its static pretrained parameters, fostering continuous learning and self-evolution. We evaluate MUSE on the long-horizon productivity benchmark TAC. It achieves new SOTA performance by a significant margin using only a lightweight Gemini-2.5 Flash model. Sufficient Experiments demonstrate that as the agent autonomously accumulates experience, it exhibits increasingly superior task completion capabilities, as well as robust continuous learning and self-evolution capabilities. Moreover, the accumulated experience from MUSE exhibits strong generalization properties, enabling zero-shot improvement on new tasks.

The core issue is their inability to disentangle objective reality from agents' subjective beliefs. To address this, we propose an adaptive world model-enhanced reasoning mechanism that constructs a dynamic textual world model to track entity states and temporal sequences. It dynamically monitors reasoning trajectories for confusion indicators and promptly intervenes by providing clear world state descriptions, helping models navigate through cognitive dilemmas. The mechanism mimics how humans use implicit world models to distinguish between external events and internal beliefs.

However, SFT is resource-intensive, relying on large curated datasets, rejection-sampled demonstrations, and uniform optimization across all tokens, even though only a fraction carry meaningful learning value. In this work, we explore a counterintuitive idea: can smaller language models (SLMs) teach larger language models (LLMs) by revealing high-value reasoning moments that reflect the latter's unique strength? We propose LightReasoner, a novel framework that leverages the behavioral divergence between a stronger expert model (LLM) and a weaker amateur model (SLM). LightReasoner operates in two stages: (1) a sampling stage that pinpoints critical reasoning moments and constructs supervision examples capturing the expert's advantage through expert-amateur contrast, and (2) a fine-tuning stage that aligns the expert model with these distilled examples, amplifying its reasoning strengths. Across seven mathematical benchmarks, LightReasoner improves accuracy by up to 28.1%, while reducing time consumption by 90%, sampled problems by 80%, and tuned token usage by 99%, all without relying on ground-truth labels. By turning weaker SLMs into effective teaching signals, LightReasoner offers a scalable and resource-efficient approach for advancing LLM reasoning.

        "summary": "Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) have led to strong performance in open-domain question answering (QA). However, existing models still struggle with questions that admit multiple valid answers. Standard QA benchmarks, which typically assume a single gold answer, overlook this reality and thus produce inappropriate training signals. Existing attempts to handle ambiguity often rely on costly manual annotation, which is difficult to scale to multi-hop datasets such as HotpotQA and MuSiQue. In this paper, we present A$^2$Search, an annotation-free, end-to-end training framework to recognize and handle ambiguity. At its core is an automated pipeline that detects ambiguous questions and gathers alternative answers via trajectory sampling and evidence verification. The model is then optimized with RL using a carefully designed $\\mathrm{AnsF1}$ reward, which naturally accommodates multiple answers. Experiments on eight open-domain QA benchmarks demonstrate that A$^2$Search achieves new state-of-the-art performance. With only a single rollout, A$^2$Search-7B yields an average $\\mathrm{AnsF1}@1$ score of $48.4\\%$ across four multi-hop benchmarks, outperforming all strong baselines, including the substantially larger ReSearch-32B ($46.2\\%$). Extensive analyses further show that A$^2$Search resolves ambiguity and generalizes across benchmarks, highlighting that embracing ambiguity is essential for building more reliable QA systems.

The authors address three main areas: enriching historical dictionaries with modern word forms and meanings; using vision-enabled LLMs to perform text recognition on sources printed in Gothic script (Fraktur); and preparing for the creation of a unified, cross-source dataset. Initial experiments with J. Gutslaff's 1648 dictionary indicate that LLMs have significant potential for semi-automatic enrichment of dictionary information. When provided with sufficient context, Claude 3.7 Sonnet accurately provided meanings and modern equivalents for 81% of headword entries. In a text recognition experiment with A. T. Helle's 1732 dictionary, a zero-shot method successfully identified and structured 41% of headword entries into error-free JSON-formatted output. For digitising the Estonian-German dictionary section of A. W. Hupel's 1780 grammar, overlapping tiling of scanned image files is employed, with one LLM being used for text recognition and a second for merging the structured output. These findings demonstrate that even for minor languages LLMs have a significant potential for saving time and financial resources.",

In sensitive domains, such omissions can result in significant harm comparable to that posed by factual inaccuracies, including hallucinations. In this study, we address the challenge of evaluating the comprehensiveness of LLM-generated texts, focusing on the detection of missing information or underrepresented viewpoints. We investigate three automated evaluation strategies: (1) an NLI-based method that decomposes texts into atomic statements and uses natural language inference (NLI) to identify missing links, (2) a Q&A-based approach that extracts question-answer pairs and compares responses across sources, and (3) an end-to-end method that directly identifies missing content using LLMs. Our experiments demonstrate the surprising effectiveness of the simple end-to-end approach compared to more complex methods, though at the cost of reduced robustness, interpretability and result granularity. We further assess the comprehensiveness of responses from several popular open-weight LLMs when answering user queries based on multiple sources.",

In this paper, we propose a unified Large Language Model (LLM)-enhanced auto-grading framework that provides human-like evaluation for all types of subjective questions across various domains. Our framework integrates four complementary modules to holistically evaluate student answers. In addition to a basic text matching module that provides a foundational assessment of content similarity, we leverage the powerful reasoning and generative capabilities of LLMs to: (1) compare key knowledge points extracted from both student and reference answers, (2) generate a pseudo-question from the student answer to assess its relevance to the original question, and (3) simulate human evaluation by identifying content-related and non-content strengths and weaknesses. Extensive experiments on both general-purpose and domain-specific datasets show that our framework consistently outperforms traditional and LLM-based baselines across multiple grading metrics.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) require efficient knowledge editing (KE) to update factual information, yet existing methods exhibit significant performance decay in multi-hop factual recall. This failure is particularly acute when edits involve intermediate implicit subjects within reasoning chains. Through causal analysis, we reveal that this limitation stems from an oversight of how chained knowledge is dynamically represented and utilized at the neuron level. We discover that during multi hop reasoning, implicit subjects function as query neurons, which sequentially activate corresponding value neurons across transformer layers to accumulate information toward the final answer, a dynamic prior KE work has overlooked. Guided by this insight, we propose ACE: Attribution-Controlled Knowledge Editing for Multi-hop Factual Recall, a framework that leverages neuron-level attribution to identify and edit these critical query-value (Q-V) pathways. ACE provides a mechanistically grounded solution for multi-hop KE, empirically outperforming state-of-the-art methods by 9.44% on GPT-J and 37.46% on Qwen3-8B. Our analysis further reveals more fine-grained activation patterns in Qwen3 and demonstrates that the semantic interpretability of value neurons is orchestrated by query-driven accumulation.

Unlike prior benchmarks that depend on subjective judgments or general reasoning, MCBench offers an objective, deterministic and codeverifiable evaluation. This setup allows us to systematically test whether LLMs can maintain accurate step-by-step execution, including instruction adherence, numerical computation, and long-range consistency in handling intermediate results.

We compare standard-to-dialect transfer in three settings: text models, speech models, and cascaded systems where speech first gets automatically transcribed and then further processed by a text model. In our experiments, we focus on German and multiple German dialects in the context of written and spoken intent and topic classification. To that end, we release the first dialectal audio intent classification dataset. We find that the speech-only setup provides the best results on the dialect data while the text-only setup works best on the standard data. While the cascaded systems lag behind the text-only models for German, they perform relatively well on the dialectal data if the transcription system generates normalized, standard-like output.",

However, its robustness and generalization are hindered by the noise and biases in weak-model outputs, which limit its applicability in practice. To address this challenge, we leverage implicit rewards, which approximate explicit rewards through log-likelihood ratios, and reveal their structural equivalence with Contrastive Decoding (CD), a decoding strategy shown to reduce noise in LLM generation. Building on this connection, we propose Contrastive Weak-to-Strong Generalization (ConG), a framework that employs contrastive decoding between pre- and post-alignment weak models to generate higher-quality samples. This approach enables more reliable capability transfer, denoising, and improved robustness, substantially mitigating the limitations of traditional weak-to-strong methods. Empirical results across different model families confirm consistent improvements, demonstrating the generality and effectiveness of ConG. Taken together, our findings highlight the potential of ConG to advance weak-to-strong generalization and provide a promising pathway toward AGI.",

Yet, this capability introduces a critical and often overlooked inefficiency -- overthinking -- models often engage in unnecessarily extensive reasoning even for simple queries, incurring significant computations without accuracy improvements. While prior work has explored solutions to mitigate overthinking, a fundamental gap remains in our understanding of its underlying causes. Most existing analyses are limited to superficial, profiling-based observations, failing to delve into LLMs' inner workings. This study introduces a systematic, fine-grained analyzer of LLMs' thought process to bridge the gap, TRACE. We first benchmark the overthinking issue, confirming that long-thinking models are five to twenty times slower on simple tasks with no substantial gains. We then use TRACE to first decompose the thought process into minimally complete sub-thoughts. Next, by inferring discourse relationships among sub-thoughts, we construct granular thought progression graphs and subsequently identify common thinking patterns for topically similar queries. Our analysis reveals two major patterns for open-weight thinking models -- Explorer and Late Landing. This finding provides evidence that over-verification and over-exploration are the primary drivers of overthinking in LLMs. Grounded in thought structures, we propose a utility-based definition of overthinking, which moves beyond length-based metrics. This revised definition offers a more insightful understanding of LLMs' thought progression, as well as practical guidelines for principled overthinking management.",

AdaSwitch allows the student to first explore its own predictions and then selectively integrate teacher guidance based on real-time quality assessment.

However, designing an optimal topology is a non-trivial challenge, as it requires balancing competing objectives such as task performance, communication cost, and robustness. Existing frameworks often rely on static or hand-crafted topologies, which inherently fail to adapt to diverse task requirements, leading to either excessive token consumption for simple problems or performance bottlenecks for complex ones. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel generative framework called \\textit{Guided Topology Diffusion (GTD)}. Inspired by conditional discrete graph diffusion models, GTD formulates topology synthesis as an iterative construction process. At each step, the generation is steered by a lightweight proxy model that predicts multi-objective rewards (e.g., accuracy, utility, cost), enabling real-time, gradient-free optimization towards task-adaptive topologies. This iterative, guided synthesis process distinguishes GTD from single-step generative frameworks, enabling it to better navigate complex design trade-offs. We validated GTD across multiple benchmarks, and experiments show that this framework can generate highly task-adaptive, sparse, and efficient communication topologies, significantly outperforming existing methods in LLM agent collaboration.",

        "summary": "Agentic RAG is a powerful technique for incorporating external information that LLMs lack, enabling better problem solving and question answering. However, suboptimal search behaviors exist widely, such as over-search (retrieving information already known) and under-search (failing to search when necessary), which leads to unnecessary overhead and unreliable outputs. Current training methods, which typically rely on outcome-based rewards in a RL framework, lack the fine-grained control needed to address these inefficiencies. To overcome this, we introduce Hierarchical Process Rewards for Efficient agentic RAG (HiPRAG), a training methodology that incorporates a fine-grained, knowledge-grounded process reward into the RL training. Our approach evaluates the necessity of each search decision on-the-fly by decomposing the agent's reasoning trajectory into discrete, parsable steps. We then apply a hierarchical reward function that provides an additional bonus based on the proportion of optimal search and non-search steps, on top of commonly used outcome and format rewards. Experiments on the Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models across seven diverse QA benchmarks show that our method achieves average accuracies of 65.4% (3B) and 67.2% (7B). This is accomplished while improving search efficiency, reducing the over-search rate to just 2.3% and concurrently lowering the under-search rate. These results demonstrate the efficacy of optimizing the reasoning process itself, not just the final outcome. Further experiments and analysis demonstrate that HiPRAG shows good generalizability across a wide range of RL algorithms, model families, sizes, and types. This work demonstrates the importance and potential of fine-grained control through RL, for improving the efficiency and optimality of reasoning for search agents.",

        "summary": "In this paper, we propose a rotation-constrained compensation method to address the errors introduced by structured pruning of large language models (LLMs). LLMs are trained on massive datasets and accumulate rich semantic knowledge in their representation space. In contrast, pruning is typically carried out with only a small amount of calibration data, which makes output mismatches unavoidable. Although direct least-squares fitting can reduce such errors, it tends to overfit to the limited calibration set, destructively modifying pretrained weights. To overcome this difficulty, we update the pruned parameters under a rotation constraint. This constrained update preserves the geometry of output representations (i.e., norms and inner products) and simultaneously re-aligns the pruned subspace with the original outputs. Furthermore, in rotation-constrained compensation, removing components that strongly contribute to the principal directions of the output makes error recovery difficult. Since input dimensions with large variance strongly affect these principal directions, we design a variance-aware importance score that ensures such dimensions are preferentially kept in the pruned model. By combining this scoring rule with rotation-constrained updates, the proposed method effectively compensates errors while retaining the components likely to be more important in a geometry-preserving manner. In the experiments, we apply the proposed method to LLaMA-7B and evaluate it on WikiText-2 and multiple language understanding benchmarks. The results demonstrate consistently better perplexity and task accuracy compared with existing baselines.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at single-turn tasks such as instruction following and summarization, yet real-world deployments require sustained multi-turn interactions where user goals and conversational context persist and evolve. A recurring challenge in this setting is context drift: the gradual divergence of a model's outputs from goal-consistent behavior across turns. Unlike single-turn errors, drift unfolds temporally and is poorly captured by static evaluation metrics. In this work, we present a study of context drift in multi-turn interactions and propose a simple dynamical framework to interpret its behavior. We formalize drift as the turn-wise KL divergence between the token-level predictive distributions of the test model and a goal-consistent reference model, and propose a recurrence model that interprets its evolution as a bounded stochastic process with restoring forces and controllable interventions. We instantiate this framework in both synthetic long-horizon rewriting tasks and realistic user-agent simulations such as in $\\tau$-Bench, measuring drift for several open-weight LLMs that are used as user simulators. Our experiments consistently reveal stable, noise-limited equilibria rather than runaway degradation, and demonstrate that simple reminder interventions reliably reduce divergence in line with theoretical predictions. Together, these results suggest that multi-turn drift can be understood as a controllable equilibrium phenomenon rather than as inevitable decay, providing a foundation for studying and mitigating context drift in extended interactions.",

Previous studies focus on a two-stage pipeline. They first learn representations of utterances with multiple labels and then use a threshold-based strategy to identify multi-label results. However, these methods rely on representation classification and ignore instance relations, leading to error propagation. To solve the above issues, we propose a multi-label joint learning method for few-shot MID in an end-to-end manner, which constructs an instance relation learning network with label knowledge propagation to eliminate error propagation. Concretely, we learn the interaction relations between instances with class information to propagate label knowledge between a few labeled (support set) and unlabeled (query set) instances. With label knowledge propagation, the relation strength between instances directly indicates whether two utterances belong to the same intent for multi-label prediction. Besides, a dual relation-enhanced loss is developed to optimize support- and query-level relation strength to improve performance. Experiments show that we outperform strong baselines by an average of 9.54% AUC and 11.19% Macro-F1 in 1-shot scenarios.",

Yet, a critical side effect remains largely overlooked: enhancing truthfulness can negatively impact safety alignment. In this paper, we investigate this trade-off and show that increasing factual accuracy often comes at the cost of weakened refusal behavior. Our analysis reveals that this arises from overlapping components in the model that simultaneously encode hallucination and refusal information, leading alignment methods to suppress factual knowledge unintentionally. We further examine how fine-tuning on benign datasets, even when curated for safety, can degrade alignment for the same reason. To address this, we propose a method that disentangles refusal-related features from hallucination features using sparse autoencoders, and preserves refusal behavior during fine-tuning through subspace orthogonalization. This approach prevents hallucinations from increasing while maintaining safety alignment.We evaluate our method on commonsense reasoning tasks and harmful benchmarks (AdvBench and StrongReject). Results demonstrate that our approach preserves refusal behavior and task utility, mitigating the trade-off between truthfulness and safety.",

        "summary": "Large language models for mathematical reasoning are typically trained with outcome-based rewards, which credit only the final answer. In our experiments, we observe that this paradigm is highly susceptible to reward hacking, leading to a substantial overestimation of a model's reasoning ability. This is evidenced by a high incidence of false positives - solutions that reach the correct final answer through an unsound reasoning process. Through a systematic analysis with human verification, we establish a taxonomy of these failure modes, identifying patterns like Miracle Steps - abrupt jumps to a correct output without a valid preceding derivation. Probing experiments suggest a strong association between these Miracle Steps and memorization, where the model appears to recall the answer directly rather than deriving it. To mitigate this systemic issue, we introduce the Rubric Reward Model (RRM), a process-oriented reward function that evaluates the entire reasoning trajectory against problem-specific rubrics. The generative RRM provides fine-grained, calibrated rewards (0-1) that explicitly penalize logical flaws and encourage rigorous deduction. When integrated into a reinforcement learning pipeline, RRM-based training consistently outperforms outcome-only supervision across four math benchmarks. Notably, it boosts Verified Pass@1024 on AIME2024 from 26.7% to 62.6% and reduces the incidence of Miracle Steps by 71%. Our work demonstrates that rewarding the solution process is crucial for building models that are not only more accurate but also more reliable.",

The widespread adoption of this tool-augmented reasoning is hindered by the scarcity of domain-specific tools. For instance, in domains such as physics question answering, suitable and specialized tools are often missing. Recent work has explored automating tool creation by extracting reusable functions from Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning traces; however, these approaches face a critical scalability bottleneck. As the number of generated tools grows, storing them in an unstructured collection leads to significant retrieval challenges, including an expanding search space and ambiguity between function-related tools. To address this, we propose a systematic approach to automatically refactor an unstructured collection of tools into a structured tool library. Our system first generates discrete, task-specific tools and clusters them into semantically coherent topics. Within each cluster, we introduce a multi-agent framework to consolidate scattered functionalities: a code agent refactors code to extract shared logic and creates versatile, aggregated tools, while a reviewing agent ensures that these aggregated tools maintain the complete functional capabilities of the original set. This process transforms numerous question-specific tools into a smaller set of powerful, aggregated tools without loss of functionality. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves tool retrieval accuracy and overall reasoning performance across multiple reasoning tasks. Furthermore, our method shows enhanced scalability compared with baselines as the number of question-specific increases.",

Such partial-input success is often deemed problematic, but reasoning traces could reveal if these strategies are truly shallow in choices-only settings. To study these strategies, reasoning LLMs solve MCQs in full and choices-only inputs; test-time reasoning often boosts accuracy on full and in choices-only half the time. While possibly due to shallow shortcuts, choices-only success is barely affected by the length of reasoning traces, and after finding traces pass faithfulness tests, we show they use less problematic strategies like inferring missing questions. In all, we challenge claims that partial-input success is always a flaw, so we discuss how reasoning traces could separate problematic data from less problematic reasoning.",

However, producing rubrics that are both reliable and scalable remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce OpenRubrics, a diverse, large-scale collection of (prompt, rubric) pairs for training rubric-generation and rubric-based reward models. To elicit discriminative and comprehensive evaluation signals, we introduce Contrastive Rubric Generation (CRG), which derives both hard rules (explicit constraints) and principles (implicit qualities) by contrasting preferred and rejected responses. We further improve reliability by enforcing preference-label consistency via rejection sampling to remove noisy rubrics. Across multiple reward-modeling benchmarks, our rubric-based reward model, Rubric-RM, surpasses strong size-matched baselines by 6.8%. These gains transfer to policy models on instruction-following and biomedical benchmarks.

In this work, we propose \\textbf{MemWeaver}, a framework that weaves the user's entire textual history into a hierarchical memory to power deeply personalized generation. The core innovation of our memory lies in its ability to capture both the temporal evolution of interests and the semantic relationships between different activities. To achieve this, MemWeaver builds two complementary memory components that both integrate temporal and semantic information, but at different levels of abstraction: behavioral memory, which captures specific user actions, and cognitive memory, which represents long-term preferences. This dual-component memory serves as a unified representation of the user, allowing large language models (LLMs) to reason over both concrete behaviors and abstracted traits.

Existing hate speech detection models, which predominantly rely on surface-level linguistic cues, fail to generalize effectively across diverse stylistic variations. Moreover, hate speech spread on different platforms often targets distinct groups and adopts unique styles, potentially inducing spurious correlations between them and labels, further challenging current detection approaches. Motivated by these observations, we hypothesize that the generation of hate speech can be modeled as a causal graph involving key factors: contextual environment, creator motivation, target, and style. Guided by this graph, we propose CADET, a causal representation learning framework that disentangles hate speech into interpretable latent factors and then controls confounders, thereby isolating genuine hate intent from superficial linguistic cues. Furthermore, CADET allows counterfactual reasoning by intervening on style within the latent space, naturally guiding the model to robustly identify hate speech in varying forms. CADET demonstrates superior performance in comprehensive experiments, highlighting the potential of causal priors in advancing generalizable hate speech detection.",

However, these specifications face critical challenges, including internal conflicts between principles and insufficient coverage of nuanced scenarios. We present a systematic methodology for stress-testing model character specifications, automatically identifying numerous cases of principle contradictions and interpretive ambiguities in current model specs. We stress test current model specs by generating scenarios that force explicit tradeoffs between competing value-based principles. Using a comprehensive taxonomy we generate diverse value tradeoff scenarios where models must choose between pairs of legitimate principles that cannot be simultaneously satisfied. We evaluate responses from twelve frontier LLMs across major providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, xAI) and measure behavioral disagreement through value classification scores. Among these scenarios, we identify over 70,000 cases exhibiting significant behavioral divergence. Empirically, we show this high divergence in model behavior strongly predicts underlying problems in model specifications. Through qualitative analysis, we provide numerous example issues in current model specs such as direct contradiction and interpretive ambiguities of several principles. Additionally, our generated dataset also reveals both clear misalignment cases and false-positive refusals across all of the frontier models we study. Lastly, we also provide value prioritization patterns and differences of these models.",

We show that, curiously, NLI and TP bias evaluation behave substantially differently, with very low correlation among different NLI metrics and between NLI and TP metrics. We find that NLI metrics are more likely to detect \"underdebiased\" cases. However, NLI metrics seem to be more brittle and sensitive to wording of counterstereotypical sentences than TP approaches.

Existing cache eviction methods address this by exploiting attention sparsity, yet they typically rank tokens heuristically using accumulated attention weights without considering their true impact on attention outputs. We propose Optimal Brain Cache (OBCache), a principled framework that formulates cache eviction as a layer-wise structured pruning problem. Building upon the Optimal Brain Damage (OBD) theory, OBCache quantifies token saliency by measuring the perturbation in attention outputs induced by pruning tokens, with closed-form scores derived for isolated keys, isolated values, and joint key-value pairs. Our scores account not only for attention weights but also for information from value states and attention outputs, thereby enhancing existing eviction strategies with output-aware signals. Experiments on LLaMA and Qwen models demonstrate that replacing the heuristic scores in existing works, which estimate token saliency across different query positions, with OBCache's output-aware scores consistently improves long-context accuracy.",

Across multiple model families, explicit verification (the two-step framework) improves refusal precision and lowers false permits.

Our key findings are as follows: 1) During training, the vocabulary embedding geometry quickly converges to high correlations with a suite of semantic and syntactic features; 2) Embeddings of high-frequency and function words (e.g., \"the,\" \"of\") converge to their final vectors faster than lexical and low-frequency words, which retain some alignment with the bias in their random initializations. These findings help map the dynamic trajectory by which input embeddings organize around linguistic structure, revealing distinct roles for word frequency and function. Our findings motivate a deeper study of how the evolution of vocabulary geometry may facilitate specific capability gains during model training.",

        "summary": "We present a system that uses LLMs as a tool in the development of Constructed Languages. The system is modular in that one first creates a target phonology for the language using an agentic approach that refines its output at each step with commentary feedback on its previous attempt. Next, a set of sentences is 'translated' from their English original into a morphosyntactic markup that reflects the word order and morphosyntactic feature specifications of the desired target language, with affixes represented as morphosyntactic feature bundles. From this translated corpus, a lexicon is constructed using the phonological model and the set of morphemes (stems and affixes) extracted from the 'translated' sentences. The system is then instructed to provide an orthography for the language, using an existing script such as Latin or Cyrillic. Finally, the system writes a brief grammatical handbook of the language. The system can also translate further sentences into the target language. Our goal is twofold. First, we hope that these tools will be fun to use for creating artificially constructed languages. Second, we are interested in exploring what LLMs 'know' about language-not what they know about any particular language or linguistic phenomenon, but how much they know about and understand language and linguistic concepts. As we shall see, there is a fairly wide gulf in capabilities both among different LLMs and among different linguistic specifications, with it being notably easier for systems to deal with more common patterns than rarer ones. An additional avenue that we explore is the application of our approach to translating from high-resource into low-resource languages. While the results so far are mostly negative, we provide some evidence that an improved version of the present system could afford some real gains in such tasks. https://github.com/SakanaAI/IASC",

Drawing on three corpora: COVID-19 false narratives (n = 7588), general COVID-19 content (n = 10700), and Monkeypox-related posts (n = 5787), we identify significant differences in readability, rhetorical markers, and persuasive language use. COVID-19 misinformation exhibited markedly lower readability scores and contained over twice the frequency of fear-related or persuasive terms compared to the other datasets. It also showed minimal use of exclamation marks, contrasting with the more emotive style of Monkeypox content. These patterns suggest that misinformation employs a deliberately complex rhetorical style embedded with emotional cues, a combination that may enhance its perceived credibility. Our findings contribute to the growing body of work on digital health misinformation by highlighting linguistic indicators that may aid detection efforts. They also inform public health messaging strategies and theoretical models of crisis communication in networked media environments. At the same time, the study acknowledges limitations, including reliance on traditional readability indices, use of a deliberately narrow persuasive lexicon, and reliance on static aggregate analysis. Future research should therefore incorporate longitudinal designs, broader emotion lexicons, and platform-sensitive approaches to strengthen robustness.",

Experiments show that multi-criteria prompting exposes robustness gaps, which led to a huge drop in performance for 7B models, including specialized LVLM judges like LLaVA-Critic. In addition, we find that our tiny LVLM (ChartJudge) can effectively transfer knowledge from one dataset to another to make it a more specialized model.

Despite the significant similarity between the dialects of each country, script differences prevent simple one-to-one mapping, hindering written communication and interaction between Tajikistan and its Persian-speaking ``siblings''. To overcome this, previously-published efforts have investigated machine transliteration models to convert between the two scripts. Unfortunately, most efforts did not use datasets other than those they created, limiting these models to certain domains of text such as archaic poetry or word lists. A truly usable transliteration system must be capable of handling varied domains, meaning that suck models lack the versatility required for real-world usage. The contrast in domain between data also obscures the task's true difficulty. We present a new state-of-the-art sequence-to-sequence model for Tajik-Farsi transliteration trained across all available datasets, and present two datasets of our own.

We address this gap with thought templates, which recast reasoning as reusable thought caches, derived from prior problem solving traces, structuring how evidence is combined and guiding multi-hop inference with factual documents.

Previously, chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting or fine-tuning has been to shown to significantly improve the reasoning abilities of text-based LLMs. In this work, we investigate the effect of CoT fine-tuning for multi-stream speech LLMs, demonstrating that reasoning in text space improves the accuracy of speech LLMs by 2.4x, on average, over a suite of spoken reasoning tasks. Beyond accuracy, the latency of the spoken response is a crucial factor for interacting with voice-based agents. Inspired by the human behavior of \"thinking while listening,\" we propose methods to reduce the additional latency from reasoning by allowing the model to start reasoning before the user query has ended. To achieve this, we introduce an entropy-based metric, \"question completeness,\" which acts as an indicator to guide the model on the optimal time to start reasoning. This method provides greater control over the accuracy-latency trade-off compared with heuristic-based approaches and, under equivalent latency conditions, yields a 4% accuracy gain on ARC-Easy. Finally, we use Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on preference data created using rejection sampling to push the accuracy-latency pareto frontier further, resulting in a 70% reduction in latency without loss in accuracy.",

        "summary": "Test-time scaling (TTS) boosts LLM reasoning via long chain-of-thought (CoT), but the linear KV-cache growth amplifies the memory-bound bottleneck of LLM decoding. Query-aware page-level sparse decoding can achieve state-of-the-art performance under constrained FLOPs budgets, but is limited by both sequential-dependent page filtering and coarse-grained token selection, hampering serving efficiency and model performance on TTS tasks under high concurrency and long CoT scenarios (consuming even higher runtime than the forward pipeline itself). In this paper, we first find that the current-step query state can be accurately approximated in a unified manner from a short window of recent queries, enabling training-free query-aware sparsity without waiting in the decoding loop. We propose AsyncSpade, an asynchronous framework for efficient TTS built on two core components: (1) a novel light-weight temporal-regressive module that predicts the next-token query state; (2) an asynchronous and disaggregated framework that decouples the KV cache filtering from the auto-regressive decoding loop, overlapping the token-level KV selection with the forward inference computation through asynchronism. To our knowledge, AsyncSpade is the first to eliminate the sequential dependence without sacrificing model performance. We validate the effectiveness of AsyncSpade on common LLM serving setups with an A100 node, where AsyncSpade fully overlaps KV-cache operations with the inference pipeline, achieving theoretical optimal time-per-output-token (TPOT). Specifically, AsyncSpade delivers over 20% reduction on TPOT compared to SoTA baseline (i.e. Quest) and at least 50% TPOT reduction compared to full attention on Qwen3-8B and Qwen3-32B models, while matching or surpassing their accuracy on various TTS benchmarks (AIME-24/25, GPQA-Diamond, MATH-500).",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, and LLM-based agents further extend these abilities to various practical workflows. While recent progress shows that multi-agent systems (MAS) can outperform single agents by coordinating specialized roles, designing effective MAS remains difficult due to prompt sensitivity and the compounded instability MAS creates. To cope with the challenge, recent efforts in automated prompt design have reduced manual effort. However, multi-agent prompt optimization remains largely unexplored. Challenges like exponentially expanding search space and ambiguous credit assignment together make systematic design intractable without principled methods. Therefore, we introduce M}ulti-Agent PRompt Optimization (MAPRO), a four-stage framework that first formulates MAS prompt optimization as a Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) inference problem and solves it using a language-guided variant of max-product belief propagation algorithm. To address credit assignment and updates the system iteratively, MAPRO employs a topology-aware refinement mechanism that integrates execution feedback and downstream blames to selectively update agent prompts. Through this process, MAPRO progressively converges to a coordinated set of agent-specific prompt policies. Across benchmarks in various tasks, MAPRO achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently surpassing manually engineered baselines and recent automated alternatives. Beyond performance, our MAP-based formulation also delivers general guidelines for building more reliable and principled multi-agent systems in the future",

Traditional strategies based on textual analysis have been critical for building the field's foundations and providing a valid, objective indicator of populist framing.

Here we present the results from a rubric and anchor guided chain of thought (CoT) prompting approach that mirrors human coder training. By leveraging the Global Populism Database (GPD), a comprehensive dataset of global leaders' speeches annotated for degrees of populism, we replicate the process used to train human coders by prompting the LLM with an adapted version of the same documentation to guide the model's reasoning. We then test multiple proprietary and open weight models by replicating scores in the GPD. Our findings reveal that this domain specific prompting strategy enables the LLM to achieve classification accuracy on par with expert human coders, demonstrating its ability to navigate the nuanced, context sensitive aspects of populism.",

While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated their ability to achieve competitive results across a wide range of NLP tasks, there is no prior evidence of how effective they are in the contextual lemmatization task. In this paper, we empirically investigate the capacity of the latest generation of LLMs to perform in-context lemmatization, comparing it to the traditional fully supervised approach. In particular, we consider the setting in which supervised training data is not available for a target domain or language, comparing (i) encoder-only supervised approaches, fine-tuned out-of-domain, and (ii) cross-lingual methods, against direct in-context lemma generation with LLMs. Our experimental investigation across 12 languages of different morphological complexity finds that, while encoders remain competitive in out-of-domain settings when fine-tuned on gold data, current LLMs reach state-of-the-art results for most languages by directly generating lemmas in-context without prior fine-tuning, provided just with a few examples.

        "summary": "Modern long-context large language models (LLMs) perform well on synthetic \"needle-in-a-haystack\" (NIAH) benchmarks, but such tests overlook how noisy contexts arise from biased retrieval and agentic workflows. We argue that haystack engineering is necessary to construct noisy long contexts that faithfully capture key real-world factors -- distraction from heterogeneous biased retrievers and cascading errors in agentic workflows -- to test models' long-context robustness. We instantiate it through HaystackCraft, a new NIAH benchmark built on the full English Wikipedia hyperlink network with multi-hop questions. HaystackCraft evaluates how heterogeneous retrieval strategies (e.g., sparse, dense, hybrid, and graph-based) affect distractor composition, haystack ordering, and downstream LLM performance. HaystackCraft further extends NIAH to dynamic, LLM-dependent settings that simulate agentic operations, where models refine queries, reflect on their past reasonings, and decide when to stop. Experiments with 15 long-context models show that (1) while stronger dense retrievers can introduce more challenging distractors, graph-based reranking simultaneously improves retrieval effectiveness and mitigates more harmful distractors; (2) in agentic tests, even advanced models like Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT-5 suffer cascading failures from self-generated distractors or struggle to perform early stops. These results highlight persistent challenges in agentic long-context reasoning and establish HaystackCraft as a valuable testbed for future progress.",

        "summary": "A long-term goal of language agents is to learn and improve through their own experience, ultimately outperforming humans in complex, real-world tasks. However, training agents from experience data with reinforcement learning remains difficult in many environments, which either lack verifiable rewards (e.g., websites) or require inefficient long-horizon rollouts (e.g., multi-turn tool use). As a result, most current agents rely on supervised fine-tuning on expert data, which is challenging to scale and generalizes poorly. This limitation stems from the nature of expert demonstrations: they capture only a narrow range of scenarios and expose the agent to limited environment diversity. We address this limitation with a middle-ground paradigm we call early experience: interaction data generated by the agent's own actions, where the resulting future states serve as supervision without reward signals. Within this paradigm we study two strategies of using such data: (1) Implicit world modeling, which uses collected states to ground the policy in environment dynamics; and (2) Self-reflection, where the agent learns from its suboptimal actions to improve reasoning and decision-making. We evaluate across eight diverse environments and multiple model families. Our approaches consistently improve effectiveness and out-of-domain generalization, highlighting the value of early experience. Moreover, in environments with verifiable rewards, our results provide promising signals that early experience offers a strong foundation for subsequent reinforcement learning, positioning it as a practical bridge between imitation learning and fully experience-driven agents.",

We introduce SpatialLadder-26k, a multimodal dataset containing 26,610 samples spanning object localization, single image, multi-view, and video spatial reasoning tasks, constructed through a standardized pipeline that ensures systematic coverage across modalities. Building on this dataset, we design a three-stage progressive training framework that (1) establishes spatial perception through object localization, (2) develops spatial understanding through multi-dimensional spatial tasks, and (3) strengthens complex reasoning via reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards. This approach yields SpatialLadder, a 3B-parameter model that achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial reasoning benchmarks, with 23.4% average improvement over the base model, surpassing GPT-4o by 20.8% and Gemini-2.0-Flash by 10.1%.

Strategic information gathering requires models to know not only how to effectively acquire information, but also when to stop gathering information and make a decision, in order to avoid overthinking or getting derailed when acting. In this paper, we formalize this problem and introduce Counterfactuals and Reasoning for Termination (CaRT), an approach for teaching LLMs when to stop seeking information. To appropriately learn when to terminate, CaRT fine-tunes LLMs using counterfactual pairs of trajectories, one where termination is appropriate and a minimally modified version of the same trajectory where it is not. It trains the LLM to explain the rationale for the termination decision in either case via verbal reasoning, and imbues this capability into the base LLM via fine-tuning. We instantiate CaRT in two domains: interactive medical diagnosis and math problem solving. In both domains, we find that CaRT improves the efficiency of information gathering and task success rate compared to other fine-tuning methods.",

        "summary": "This paper presents a theoretical framework explaining why fine tuning small, randomly selected subnetworks (slices) within pre trained models can be sufficient for downstream adaptation. We prove that pretrained networks exhibit a universal winning slice property arising from two phenomena: (1) spectral balance the eigenspectra of different weight matrix slices are remarkably similar; and (2) high task energy their backbone representations retain rich, task relevant features. This leads to the Universal Winning Slice Hypothesis, which provides a theoretical foundation for parameter efficient fine tuning (PEFT) in large scale models. Inspired by this, we propose SliceFine, a PEFT method that exploits this inherent redundancy by updating only selected slices of the original weights introducing zero new parameters, unlike adapter-based approaches. Empirically, SliceFine matches the performance of state of the art PEFT methods across language and vision tasks, while significantly improving training speed, memory efficiency, and model compactness. Our work bridges theory and practice, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to existing PEFT techniques.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance in general programming tasks. However, in Machine Learning Engineering (MLE) scenarios such as AutoML and Kaggle competitions, achieving high performance depends heavily on expert intervention and repeated adjustments rather than simply generating correct code. When applied directly to these tasks, LLMs often lack fine-grained domain priors, and existing MLE approaches that use linear or tree-structured searches limit knowledge transfer to adjacent hierarchical links. As a result, they cannot leverage past full trajectories or share information across branches, limiting self-evolving ability and search space diversity. To address these limitations, we introduce AutoMLGen, an LLM-based coding agent that integrates a domain knowledge base for high-quality prior guidance and Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. MCGS retains the tree-guided exploration of MCTS while embedding a graph structure into the expansion stage to enable dynamic path reorganization, historical trajectory reuse, and multi-solution fusion to support both self-evolution and collaborative learning. Combined with fine-grained operator sets, this design improves stability and accelerates convergence. Evaluation on the MLE-Bench shows that AutoMLGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in numerous dimensions, such as the average medal rate and the valid submission rate, under a 12-hour budget (half the standard runtime).

        "summary": "Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) have recently emerged as powerful architectures capable of understanding and reasoning over both visual and textual information. These models typically rely on two key components: a Vision Transformer (ViT) and a Large Language Model (LLM). ViT encodes visual content into a sequence of image tokens and serves as the perceptual front-end -- the eyes of the model. In contrast, the LLM interprets these tokens to perform high-level reasoning, generates responses, and functions as the cognitive core -- the brain of the model. However, it remains unclear which visual tokens contribute most significantly to understanding and reasoning, and how effectively these signals are propagated from ViT to the LLM. While most existing works have focused on identifying attention sinks, low-semantic tokens receiving disproportionately high attention, within the LLM, we shift the focus to the vision encoder by identifying a class of high-norm visual tokens from ViT, referred to as ViT attention sinks -- a problem that has been rarely studied but is indeed very important for LVLMs. Our findings show that these ViT sinks encapsulate high-level semantic concepts from images, allowing the LLM to perform more effective understanding and reasoning. Despite their importance, these sink tokens are often overlooked in existing LVLM architectures. To explore their contribution, we present both qualitative and quantitative analyses of the information embedded in these sink tokens. We also propose both training-free and training-based approaches to better leverage how this information is interpreted by the LLM, and to what extent. By explicitly utilizing these tokens, we demonstrate substantial improvements across a range of LVLMs and visual reasoning tasks, highlighting the untapped potential of ViT attention sinks in enhancing visual reasoning.",

For vision-language models (VLMs), the challenge is to recover such essential mappings from dynamic human motion rather than static context. We introduce the \\textit{Visual Iconicity Challenge}, a novel video-based benchmark that adapts psycholinguistic measures to evaluate VLMs on three tasks: (i) phonological sign-form prediction (e.g., handshape, location), (ii) transparency (inferring meaning from visual form), and (iii) graded iconicity ratings. We assess $13$ state-of-the-art VLMs in zero- and few-shot settings on Sign Language of the Netherlands and compare them to human baselines. On \\textit{phonological form prediction}, VLMs recover some handshape and location detail but remain below human performance; on \\textit{transparency}, they are far from human baselines; and only top models correlate moderately with human \\textit{iconicity ratings}. Interestingly, \\textit{models with stronger phonological form prediction correlate better with human iconicity judgment}, indicating shared sensitivity to visually grounded structure. Our findings validate these diagnostic tasks and motivate human-centric signals and embodied learning methods for modelling iconicity and improving visual grounding in multimodal models.",

Evaluation on five benchmarks (BLiMP, BLiMP Supplement, EWoK, Winoground and VQA) shows competitive or superior performance to multimodal baselines.

The router is trained end-to-end with reinforcement learning using an explicit, cost-aware reward that encodes cost-performance trade-offs, eliminating the need for hand-engineered routing rules. Our implementation encompasses the full reinforcement learning framework, including reward and cost accounting, as well as the deployment and evaluation pipelines. Across diverse benchmarks, xRouter achieves strong cost-performance trade-offs (e.g., substantial cost reductions at comparable task completion rates), and provides empirical insights into what reliably helps learned routing and what does not, ranging from model trainability to the difficulty of eliciting sophisticated orchestration behaviors in small open models. We hope these findings and our open implementation will serve as a practical substrate for advancing learned, cost-aware LLM orchestration.",

Although Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)-based LoRA variants show promise in mitigating intra-task correlations in single-task instruction tuning, they introduce additional router parameters and remain ineffective in multi-task model merging where inter-task interference arises. Inspired by the fly olfactory circuit, we propose FlyLoRA, an implicit MoE-based LoRA variant that introduces: (1) rank-wise expert activation in the up-projection matrix, and (2) an implicit router that unifies expert routing and down-projection, where a frozen sparse random projection matrix replaces the traditional dense trainable version. This design resolves the trade-off between intra-task decorrelation and computational efficiency by eliminating the need for an explicit router, while inherently mitigating inter-task interference due to the orthogonality property of random matrices. Extensive experiments across four domains -- general knowledge understanding, scientific question answering, mathematical reasoning, and code generation -- demonstrate consistent performance improvements over existing methods. Beyond empirical gains, FlyLoRA highlights how biological structures can inspire innovations in AI technologies. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/FlyLoRA.",

To assess the reasoning boundary (the fraction of problems a model can solve) researchers often report Pass@k at large sampling budgets. Recent results reveal a crossover phenomenon: while RLVR models outperform the base model at small k values, the base model usually outperforms them when sampling a very large number of completions. This has been interpreted as evidence that base models have a larger reasoning boundary. We argue that on tasks with discrete answer spaces, such as math with numeric outputs, Pass@k at large k reflects the increasingly higher chance of success in the limit of the number of trials rather than genuine reasoning, and can therefore be misleading. We propose Cover@tau, which measures the fraction of problems that a model can solve for which at least a tau proportion of completions are correct. Unlike Pass@k, Cover@tau captures reasoning under an explicit reliability threshold: models that rely on random guessing degrade rapidly as tau increases. We evaluate several RLVR models using Cover@tau-based metrics and illustrate how the relative rankings of popular algorithms change compared to Pass@1, offering a different perspective on reasoning boundaries.",

However, existing DPO formulations rely on a single monolithic model, which limits their expressivity in multi-task settings and their adaptability to heterogeneous or diverse preference distributions. In this work, we propose Mix- and MoE-DPO, a framework that extends DPO with both soft mixture models and mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures, using a stochastic variational inference approach. Our method introduces a latent-variable model over expert assignments and optimizes a variational evidence lower bound (ELBO), enabling stable and efficient learning of specialized expert policies from preference data. Mix- and MoE-DPO provides three key advantages over standard DPO: (i) generalization via universal function approximation through mixtures; (ii) reward and policy specialization through expert components tailored to distinct preference modes; and (iii) contextual alignment through input-dependent soft gating that enables user-specific mixture policies. Our framework supports both shared base architectures with expert-specific policy heads and fully independent expert models, allowing flexible trade-offs between parameter efficiency and specialization. We validate our approach on a variety of model sizes and multi-preference datasets, demonstrating that Mix- and MoE-DPO offers a powerful and scalable method for preference-based LLM alignment.",

However, existing benchmarks mainly focus on immediate, single-horizon tasks, failing to adequately evaluate models' ability to understand and respond to complex, long-horizon scenarios. To address this incomplete evaluation of Large Reasoning Models (LRMs), we propose R-HORIZON, a method designed to stimulate long-horizon reasoning behaviors in LRMs through query composition. Based on R-HORIZON, we construct a long-horizon reasoning benchmark, comprising complex multi-step reasoning tasks with interdependent problems that span long reasoning horizons. Through comprehensive evaluation of LRMs using the R-HORIZON benchmark, we find that even the most advanced LRMs suffer significant performance degradation. Our analysis reveals that LRMs exhibit limited effective reasoning length and struggle to allocate thinking budget across multiple problems appropriately. Recognizing these limitations, we use R-HORIZON to construct long-horizon reasoning data for reinforcement learning with verified rewards (RLVR). Compared to training with single-horizon data, RLVR with R-HORIZON not only substantially improves performance on the multi-horizon reasoning tasks, but also promotes accuracy on standard reasoning tasks, with an increase of 7.5 on AIME2024. These results position R-HORIZON as a scalable, controllable, and low-cost paradigm for enhancing and evaluating the long-horizon reasoning capabilities of LRMs.",

This study investigates the manipulability of risk aversion (MoRA) in LMs, examining their ability to replicate human risk preferences across diverse economic scenarios, with a focus on gender-specific attitudes, uncertainty, role-based decision-making, and the manipulability of risk aversion. The results indicate that while LMs such as DeepSeek Reasoner and Gemini-2.0-flash-lite exhibit some alignment with human behaviors, notable discrepancies highlight the need to refine bio-centric measures of manipulability.

        "summary": "Query-product relevance prediction is fundamental to e-commerce search and has become even more critical in the era of AI-powered shopping, where semantic understanding and complex reasoning directly shape the user experience and business conversion. Large Language Models (LLMs) enable generative, reasoning-based approaches, typically aligned via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or preference optimization methods like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). However, the increasing complexity of business rules and user queries exposes the inability of existing methods to endow models with robust reasoning capacity for long-tail and challenging cases. Efforts to address this via reinforcement learning strategies like Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) often suffer from sparse terminal rewards, offering insufficient guidance for multi-step reasoning and slowing convergence. To address these challenges, we propose TaoSR-AGRL, an Adaptive Guided Reinforcement Learning framework for LLM-based relevance prediction in Taobao Search Relevance. TaoSR-AGRL introduces two key innovations: (1) Rule-aware Reward Shaping, which decomposes the final relevance judgment into dense, structured rewards aligned with domain-specific relevance criteria; and (2) Adaptive Guided Replay, which identifies low-accuracy rollouts during training and injects targeted ground-truth guidance to steer the policy away from stagnant, rule-violating reasoning patterns toward compliant trajectories. TaoSR-AGRL was evaluated on large-scale real-world datasets and through online side-by-side human evaluations on Taobao Search. It consistently outperforms DPO and standard GRPO baselines in offline experiments, improving relevance accuracy, rule adherence, and training stability. The model trained with TaoSR-AGRL has been successfully deployed in the main search scenario on Taobao, serving hundreds of millions of users.",

Although pseudo-labeling offers a practical workaround, it often introduces systematic, accent-specific errors that filtering fails to fix.

We propose a simple parameter-space correction: in a source domain containing both real and pseudo-labeled data, two ASR models are fine-tuned from the same initialization, one on ground-truth labels and the other on pseudo-labels, and their weight difference forms a correction vector that captures pseudo-label biases. When applied to a pseudo-labeled target model, this vector enhances recognition, achieving up to a 35% relative Word Error Rate (WER) reduction on AfriSpeech-200 across ten African accents with the Whisper tiny model.",

To address this, we introduce VoiceAgentBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate SpeechLMs in realistic spoken agentic settings. It comprises over 5,500 synthetic spoken queries, including dialogues grounded in Indian context, covering single-tool invocations, multi-tool workflows, multi-turn interactions, and safety evaluations. The benchmark supports English, Hindi, and 5 other Indian languages, reflecting real-world linguistic and cultural diversity. We simulate speaker variability using a novel sampling algorithm that selects audios for TTS voice conversion based on its speaker embeddings, maximizing acoustic and speaker diversity. Our evaluation measures tool selection accuracy, structural consistency, and the correctness of tool invocations, including adversarial robustness. Our experiments reveal significant gaps in contextual tool orchestration tasks, Indic generalization, and adversarial robustness, exposing critical limitations of current SpeechLMs.",

Rather than direct intervention to latents or attention per-sample in existing work, we integrate and optimize new parameters guided by a general layout-attention objective. Furthermore, we formulate video generation within a streaming setting, and maintain historical optimization contexts with a parametric memory mechanism that supports flexible operations, such as insert, read, update, and delete. Notably, we found that TTOM disentangles compositional world knowledge, showing powerful transferability and generalization. Experimental results on the T2V-CompBench and Vbench benchmarks establish TTOM as an effective, practical, scalable, and efficient framework to achieve cross-modal alignment for compositional video generation on the fly.",

        "summary": "One paradigm of language model (LM) fine-tuning relies on creating large training datasets, under the assumption that high quantity and diversity will enable models to generalize to novel tasks after post-training. In practice, gathering large sets of data is inefficient, and training on them is prohibitively expensive; worse, there is no guarantee that the resulting model will handle complex scenarios or generalize better. Moreover, existing techniques rarely assess whether a training sample provides novel information or is redundant with the knowledge already acquired by the model, resulting in unnecessary costs. In this work, we explore a new test-time self-improvement method to create more effective and generalizable agentic LMs on-the-fly. The proposed algorithm can be summarized in three steps: (i) first it identifies the samples that model struggles with (self-awareness), (ii) then generates similar examples from detected uncertain samples (self-data augmentation), and (iii) uses these newly generated samples at test-time fine-tuning (self-improvement). We study two variants of this approach: Test-Time Self-Improvement (TT-SI), where the same model generates additional training examples from its own uncertain cases and then learns from them, and contrast this approach with Test-Time Distillation (TT-D), where a stronger model generates similar examples for uncertain cases, enabling student to adapt using distilled supervision. Empirical evaluations across different agent benchmarks demonstrate that TT-SI improves the performance with +5.48% absolute accuracy gain on average across all benchmarks and surpasses other standard learning methods, yet using 68x less training samples. Our findings highlight the promise of TT-SI, demonstrating the potential of self-improvement algorithms at test-time as a new paradigm for building more capable agents toward self-evolution.",

We observe that existing defense mechanisms fail to generalize to harmful queries disguised by unseen attack templates, despite LLMs being capable of distinguishing disguised harmful queries in the embedding space. Based on these insights, we propose a two-stage defense approach: (i) pre-generation defense that detects harmful queries before response generation begins, and (ii) mid-generation defense that monitors partial responses during generation to prevent outputting more harmful content. Our MetaDefense trains the LLM to predict the harmfulness of both queries and partial responses using specialized prompts, enabling early termination of potentially harmful interactions. Extensive experiments across multiple LLM architectures (LLaMA-2-7B, Qwen-2.5-3B-Instruct, and LLaMA-3.2-3B-Instruct) demonstrate that MetaDefense significantly outperforms existing defense mechanisms, achieving robust defense against harmful queries with seen and unseen attack templates while maintaining competitive performance on benign tasks.

By using two distinct methods based on natural language processing and clustering analysis to mine over eight thousand user comments on election-related YouTube videos from one right leaning journal, Wall Street Journal, and one left leaning journal, New York Times, during pre-election week, we quantify the frequency of selected issue areas among user comments to infer which issues were most salient to potential voters in the seven days preceding the November 5th election. Empirically, we primarily demonstrate that immigration and democracy were the most frequently and consistently invoked issues in user comments on the analyzed YouTube videos, followed by the issue of identity politics, while inflation was significantly less frequently referenced. These results corroborate certain findings of post-election surveys but also refute the supposed importance of inflation as an election issue. This indicates that variations on opinion mining, with their analysis of raw user data online, can be more revealing than polling and surveys for analyzing election outcomes.",

Although large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in understanding chemical tasks such as synthesis design, it is unclear to what extent this reflects genuine chemical reasoning capabilities, i.e., the ability to generate valid intermediates, maintain chemical consistency, and follow logically coherent multi-step pathways. We address this by introducing oMeBench, the first large-scale, expert-curated benchmark for organic mechanism reasoning in organic chemistry. It comprises over 10,000 annotated mechanistic steps with intermediates, type labels, and difficulty ratings. Furthermore, to evaluate LLM capability more precisely and enable fine-grained scoring, we propose oMeS, a dynamic evaluation framework that combines step-level logic and chemical similarity. We analyze the performance of state-of-the-art LLMs, and our results show that although current models display promising chemical intuition, they struggle with correct and consistent multi-step reasoning. Notably, we find that using prompting strategy and fine-tuning a specialist model on our proposed dataset increases performance by 50% over the leading closed-source model. We hope that oMeBench will serve as a rigorous foundation for advancing AI systems toward genuine chemical reasoning.",

This reduces deployment overhead but preserves the teacher's verbose reasoning, causing latency. To solve this, our second stage employs reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to compress the model's reasoning path, guided by a multi-objective reward function balancing correctness, helpfulness, and brevity. LiveThinking achieves a 30-fold reduction in computational cost, enabling sub-second latency. In real-world application on Taobao Live, it improved response correctness by 3.3% and helpfulness by 21.8%.

We revisit this problem and show that widely used evaluation metrics systematically underestimate model capability. To address this, we introduce a group matching score that better exploits group structure and reveals substantial hidden capability in both contrastive vision-language models (VLMs) and multimodal large language models (MLLMs). Moreover, simply overfitting to the induced group matchings at test time transfers this hidden capability into higher scores under standard evaluation metrics, closing much of the reported gap. This adjustment enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass all previous results and GPT-4.1 to yield the first result surpassing estimated human performance on Winoground. Building on this insight, we propose Test-Time Matching (TTM), an iterative, self-improving algorithm that further bootstraps model performance without any external supervision. TTM delivers additional, non-trivial improvements: for example, TTM enables SigLIP-B16 to surpass GPT-4.1 on MMVP-VLM, establishing a new state of the art. Importantly, TTM remains broadly effective even on benchmarks without metric-induced effects or group structures, achieving relative gains up to 85.7% on challenging datasets such as WhatsUp. Across 16 dataset variants spanning diverse setups, our experiments demonstrate that TTM consistently improves model performance and advances the frontier of compositional reasoning.",

Despite rapid progress over the past two years, research in LLM unlearning remains fragmented, with limited clarity on what constitutes effective unlearning and how it should be rigorously evaluated. In this work, we present a principled taxonomy of twelve recent stateful unlearning methods, grouped into three methodological families: divergence-driven optimization, representation misalignment, and rejection-based targeted unlearning. Building on this taxonomy, we revisit the evaluation of unlearning effectiveness (UE), utility retention (UT), and robustness (Rob), focusing on the WMDP benchmark. Our analysis shows that current evaluations, dominated by multiple-choice question (MCQ) accuracy, offer only a narrow perspective, often overstating success while overlooking the model's actual generation behavior. To address this gap, we introduce open question-answering (Open-QA) metrics that better capture generative performance and reveal the inherent UE-UT tradeoff across method families. Furthermore, we demonstrate that robustness requires finer-grained analysis: for example, vulnerabilities differ substantially between in-domain relearning and out-of-domain fine-tuning, even though both fall under model-level attacks. Through this study, we hope to deliver a full-stack revisit of LLM unlearning and actionable guidance for designing and evaluating future methods.",

Therefore, we propose PATCH (Privacy-Aware Targeted Circuit PatcHing), a novel approach that first identifies and subsequently directly edits PII circuits to reduce leakage. PATCH achieves better privacy-utility trade-off than existing defenses, e.g., reducing recall of PII leakage from LMs by up to 65%. Finally, PATCH can be combined with DP to reduce recall of residual leakage of an LM to as low as 0.01%.

Motivated by interpretability studies showing that the crucial computation required for reasoning tasks is concentrated in a limited range of layers, we introduce Encode-Think-Decode (ETD), a method that enhances the reasoning capabilities of a base model by training it to iterate over a small subset of reasoning-relevant layers during the mid-training stage. ETD amplifies latent reasoning while preserving the original architecture, parameter count, hyperparameters, and training data composition. When iterating on the selected layers at inference time, ETD models yield substantial gains on 17 reasoning benchmarks, including +28.4% relative accuracy improvement on GSM8K and +36% on MATH with the OLMo-2 1B Base model. We also explore an adaptive depth strategy that adjusts the computation per input token. Our results show that recursive latent reasoning offers a simple and effective path to stronger LLM reasoning.",

        "summary": "GPU kernel generation by LLMs has recently experienced rapid development, leveraging test-time scaling and reinforcement learning techniques. However, a key challenge for kernel generation is the scarcity of high-quality data, as most high-quality kernels are proprietary and not open-source. This challenge prevents us from leveraging supervised fine-tuning to align LLMs to the kernel generation task. To address this challenge, we develop a pipeline that generates and curates high-quality CUDA kernels with reasoning traces, motivated by a critical observation that concise yet informative reasoning traces result in robust generation of high-performance kernels. Using this pipeline, we construct our dataset ConCuR and introduce our model KernelCoder, which is the first model trained on a curated dataset consisting of PyTorch, reasoning, and CUDA kernel pairs, to our knowledge. In the KernelBench setup, our model achieves significant improvements over the existing top-performing model, QwQ-32B, and outperforms all open-source models fine-tuned for kernel generation, as well as frontier models such as DeepSeek-V3.1-Think and Claude-4-sonnet. Finally, we show that the average reasoning length can serve as a metric to assess the difficulty of kernel generation tasks. The observations, metrics, and our data collection and curation pipeline can help obtain better data in the kernel generation task in the future.",

This blocks genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\\not\\equiv s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\\text{user}}$); and self-representation is visual-silent ($g_{\\text{visual}}(a_{\\text{self}})=\\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\\subset\\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology, and dynamics (the update $F_{\\theta}$ is Lipschitz).

We study sequential fine-tuning on five target skills while monitoring general ability on eight held-out benchmarks across three model families. We observe that apparent \"forgetting\" on held-out tasks after narrow fine-tuning can partly recover at later stages. We trace this behavior to a measurable shift in the output token distribution, manifested through a simple counting-bias probe that co-varies with forgetting. Guided by this picture, we identify two simple, robust tuning recipes that learn strongly while limiting drift: (i) updating only the self-attention projection layers, and (ii) updating only the MLP Gate&Up while freezing the Down projection. Across models and tasks, these choices deliver strong target gains while largely preserving held-out performance. Code is available at https://github.com/jessemelpolio/LMM_CL",

Grounded in the spectral analysis of representations, our approach provides interpretable insights into the model's internal reasoning process through semantic variations, while requiring no extra knowledge or additional modules, thus offering a combination of theoretical elegance and practical efficiency. Meanwhile, we theoretically demonstrate the necessity of quantifying uncertainty both internally (representations of a single response) and externally (different responses), providing a justification for using representations among different layers and responses from LLMs to detect hallucinations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively detects hallucinations and generalizes robustly across various scenarios, contributing to a new paradigm of hallucination detection for LLM truthfulness.",

However, the contribution of reflections to performance improvement remains unclear. In this paper, we systematically analyze the rollouts of eight reasoning models on five mathematical datasets. We focus on reflective behaviours where the model has already produced an answer but continues reflecting before finalizing its output. Our analysis reveals that reflections are predominantly confirmatory and rarely alter the model's initial answer, a pattern consistent across models and datasets. To understand the role of reflections in training, we construct supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets with varying amounts of reflection steps. We observe that training models on rollouts with more reflection steps primarily enhances first-answer correctness rather than the ability to correct initially wrong answers through reflections. This motivates us to propose a question-aware early-stopping method that enhances inference-time token efficiency by stopping the reasoning process once a few plausible candidate answers are generated, thereby reducing unnecessary reflection steps. Motivated by this, we further propose to dynamically truncate the reflections after a candidate answer has appeared during generation, which reduces reasoning tokens by 24.5% across five mathematical datasets, within a 2.9% drop in accuracy.",

We have designed and proposed a layered solution composed of three core protocols: the Human-Agent Interaction Protocol (HAI), the Unified Agent Protocol (UAP), and the Memory-Extraction-Knowledge Protocol (MEK). HAI focuses on the interaction layer, standardizing the flow of information between users, interfaces, and agents by defining a standardized, event-driven communication paradigm. This ensures the real-time performance, reliability, and synergy of interactions. As the core of the infrastructure layer, UAP is designed to break down communication barriers among heterogeneous agents through unified service discovery and protocol conversion mechanisms, thereby enabling seamless interconnection and interoperability of the underlying network. MEK, in turn, operates at the cognitive layer. By establishing a standardized ''Memory (M) - Extraction (E) - Knowledge (K)'' cognitive chain, it empowers agents with the ability to learn from individual experiences and form shareable knowledge, thereby laying the foundation for the realization of true collective intelligence. We believe this protocol framework will provide a solid engineering foundation and theoretical guidance for building the next generation of efficient, scalable, and intelligent multi-agent applications.",

In this work, we reveal the security and robustness vulnerabilities of these agents through backdoor attacks. Distinct from traditional backdoors limited to single-step control, we propose the Chain-of-Trigger Backdoor (CoTri), a multi-step backdoor attack designed for long-horizon agentic control. CoTri relies on an ordered sequence. It starts with an initial trigger, and subsequent ones are drawn from the environment, allowing multi-step manipulation that diverts the agent from its intended task. Experimental results show that CoTri achieves a near-perfect attack success rate (ASR) while maintaining a near-zero false trigger rate (FTR). Due to training data modeling the stochastic nature of the environment, the implantation of CoTri paradoxically enhances the agent's performance on benign tasks and even improves its robustness against environmental distractions. We further validate CoTri on vision-language models (VLMs), confirming its scalability to multimodal agents. Our work highlights that CoTri achieves stable, multi-step control within agents, improving their inherent robustness and task capabilities, which ultimately makes the attack more stealthy and raises potential safty risks.",

Although humans can solve these tasks with ease, existing models, even after extensive pre-training and post-training at scale, still fail to perform reasoning reliably. In this paper, we revisit reasoning tasks from a causal perspective, seeking to understand their behavior in latent space and to offer insights for addressing their challenges. Specifically, we cast reasoning tasks as a selection mechanism, in which high-level logical concepts function as selection operators on the given observations, such as, identifying the correct answer in a math problem or filling the appropriate entry in Sudoku. We emphasize two key properties of this formulation that shed light on the difficulty of reasoning tasks. First, the latent space exceeds the observation space in complexity, even when the correct answer is fully determined by the observed input. Second, the latent variables, corresponding to logical thought, are densely structured and exhibit strong dependencies. Building on this formulation, we introduce a framework, called SR$^2$, that incorporates the estimated latent variables as feedback into the selection mechanism, thereby facilitating the learning of dense dependencies among latent representations. The framework consists of three key modules: reflective representation learning, dependency self-refinement, and periodic intermediate alignment. Experimentally, we show that our approach yields significant gains in reasoning accuracy, for example, attaining over 10$\\%$ improvement in performance with 8$\\times$ fewer parameters on the Sudoku and Maze tasks over the recent advances.",

We assume a scenario where an Agent interacts with a world governed by a causal Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), which dictates the system's dynamics but remains hidden from the Agent. The Agent's task is to accurately infer the causal DAG, even in the presence of noise. To achieve this, the Agent performs interventions, leveraging causal inference techniques to analyze the statistical significance of observed changes. Results show better performance for DODO, compared to observational approaches, in all but the most limited resource conditions. DODO is often able to reconstruct with as low as zero errors the structure of the causal graph. In the most challenging configuration, DODO outperforms the best baseline by +0.25 F1 points.",

        "summary": "Pairwise comparison methods, such as Fuzzy Preference Relations and Saaty's Multiplicative Preference Relations, are widely used to model expert judgments in multi-criteria decision-making. However, their application is limited by the high cognitive load required to complete $m(m-1)/2$ comparisons, the risk of inconsistency, and the computational complexity of deriving consistent value scales. This paper proposes the Tournament Tree Method (TTM), a novel elicitation and evaluation framework that overcomes these limitations. The TTM requires only $m-1$ pairwise comparisons to obtain a complete, reciprocal, and consistent comparison matrix. The method consists of three phases: (i) elicitation of expert judgments using a reduced set of targeted comparisons, (ii) construction of the consistent pairwise comparison matrix, and (iii) derivation of a global value scale from the resulting matrix. The proposed approach ensures consistency by design, minimizes cognitive effort, and reduces the dimensionality of preference modeling from $m(m-1)/2$ to $m$ parameters. Furthermore, it is compatible with the classical Deck of Cards method, and thus it can handle interval and ratio scales. We have also developed a web-based tool that demonstrates its practical applicability in real decision-making scenarios.",

        "summary": "The latency-quality tradeoff is a fundamental constraint in open-domain dialogue AI systems, since comprehensive knowledge access necessitates prohibitive response delays. Contemporary approaches offer two inadequate solutions: lightweight instruct models achieve sub-second latency but lack reasoning depth, while tool-augmented ReAct agents enhance factuality through external knowledge at the cost of synchronous execution that blocks interaction during re- trieval processes. PMFR is thus proposed, with a tempo- ral decoupling framework that fundamentally resolves the contradiction through asynchronous knowledge orchestra- tion. PMFR employs three coordinated components: (1) a Knowledge Adequacy Evaluator for real-time sufficiency assessment, (2) a Lightweight Response Generator for imme- diate user interaction, and (3) an Asynchronous Knowledge Refinement Agent for background knowledge enhancement. This architecture maintains continuous conversational flow while progressively enriching knowledge coverage through intelligent triggering mechanisms. Evaluation results on Top- iOCQA demonstrate PMFR outperforms brute-force scaling: PMFR achieves 95.3% latency reduction (23.38s -> 1.09s) while preserving response quality comparable to heavyweight synchronous baselines (GEval-C: 0.613 vs. 0.620).",

Using ontology engineering in OWL 2 QL, it formally defines sensitive attributes and infers their proxies through logical reasoning, constructing a sigma algebra G that captures the full structure of biased patterns. Fair representations are then obtained via Delbaen Majumdar optimal transport, which generates variables independent of G while minimizing L2 distance to preserve accuracy. This guarantees true independence rather than mere decorrelation. By modeling bias as dependence between sigma algebras, compiling ontological knowledge into measurable structures, and using optimal transport as the unique fair transformation, the approach ensures complete fairness in tasks like loan approval, where proxies such as ZIP code reveal race. The result is a certifiable and mathematically grounded method for trustworthy AI.",

While conformal selection methods offer a rigorous solution with False Discovery Rate (FDR) control, their applicability is confined to single-threshold scenarios (i.e., y > c) and overlooks practical needs for multi-condition selection, such as conjunctive or disjunctive conditions. In this work, we propose the Multi-Condition Conformal Selection (MCCS) algorithm, which extends conformal selection to scenarios with multiple conditions. In particular, we introduce a novel nonconformity score with regional monotonicity for conjunctive conditions and a global Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure for disjunctive conditions, thereby establishing finite-sample FDR control with theoretical guarantees. The integration of these components enables the proposed method to achieve rigorous FDR-controlled selection in various multi-condition environments. Extensive experiments validate the superiority of MCCS over baselines, its generalizability across diverse condition combinations, different real-world modalities, and multi-task scalability.",

        "summary": "The generation of testing and training scenarios for autonomous vehicles has drawn significant attention. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have enabled new scenario generation methods, current methods struggle to balance command adherence accuracy with the realism of real-world driving environments. To reduce scenario description complexity, these methods often compromise realism by limiting scenarios to 2D, or open-loop simulations where background vehicles follow predefined, non-interactive behaviors. We propose LinguaSim, an LLM-based framework that converts natural language into realistic, interactive 3D scenarios, ensuring both dynamic vehicle interactions and faithful alignment between the input descriptions and the generated scenarios. A feedback calibration module further refines the generation precision, improving fidelity to user intent. By bridging the gap between natural language and closed-loop, interactive simulations, LinguaSim constrains adversarial vehicle behaviors using both the scenario description and the autonomous driving model guiding them. This framework facilitates the creation of high-fidelity scenarios that enhance safety testing and training. Experiments show LinguaSim can generate scenarios with varying criticality aligned with different natural language descriptions (ACT: 0.072 s for dangerous vs. 3.532 s for safe descriptions; comfortability: 0.654 vs. 0.764), and its refinement module effectively reduces excessive aggressiveness in LinguaSim's initial outputs, lowering the crash rate from 46.9% to 6.3% to better match user intentions.",

        "summary": "Parameter-efficient finetuning (PEFT) aims to mitigate the substantial computational and memory overhead involved in adapting large-scale pretrained models to diverse downstream tasks. Among numerous PEFT strategies, Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as one of the most widely adopted approaches due to its robust empirical performance and low implementation complexity. In practical deployment, LoRA is typically applied to the $W^Q$ and $W^V$ projection matrices of self-attention modules, enabling an effective trade-off between model performance and parameter efficiency. While LoRA has achieved considerable empirical success, it still encounters challenges such as suboptimal performance and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce \\textbf{AILoRA}, a novel parameter-efficient method that incorporates function-aware asymmetric low-rank priors. Our empirical analysis reveals that the projection matrices $W^Q$ and $W^V$ in the self-attention mechanism exhibit distinct parameter characteristics, stemming from their functional differences. Specifically, $W^Q$ captures task-specific semantic space knowledge essential for attention distributions computation, making its parameters highly sensitive to downstream task variations. In contrast, $W^V$ encodes token-level feature representations that tend to remain stable across tasks and layers. Leveraging these insights, AILoRA performs a function-aware initialization by injecting the principal components of $W^Q$ to retain task-adaptive capacity, and the minor components of $W^V$ to preserve generalizable feature representations. This asymmetric initialization strategy enables LoRA modules to better capture the specialized roles of attention parameters, thereby enhancing both finetuning performance and convergence efficiency.",

        "summary": "Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks by generating detailed chain-of-thought (CoT) explanations. However, these responses are often excessively long, containing redundant reasoning steps that inflate inference cost and reduce usability. Controlling the length of generated reasoning without sacrificing accuracy remains an open challenge. Through a systematic empirical analysis, we reveal a consistent positive correlation between model entropy and response length at different reasoning stages across diverse LRMs: the thinking phase exhibits higher entropy, reflecting exploratory behavior of longer responses, while the final answer phase shows lower entropy, indicating a more deterministic solution.This observation suggests that entropy at different reasoning stages can serve as a control knob for balancing conciseness and performance. Based on this insight, this paper introduces Phase Entropy Aware Reward (PEAR), a reward mechanism that incorporating phase-dependent entropy into the reward design. Instead of treating all tokens uniformly, PEAR penalize excessive entropy during the thinking phase and allowing moderate exploration at the final answer phase, which encourages models to generate concise reasoning traces that retain sufficient flexibility to solve the task correctly. This enables adaptive control of response length without relying on explicit length targets or rigid truncation rules. Extensive experiments across four benchmarks demonstrate that PEAR consistently reduces response length while sustaining competitive accuracy across model scales. In addition, PEAR demonstrates strong out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness beyond the training distribution. Our code is available at: https://github.com/iNLP-Lab/PEAR.",

        "summary": "Recent research has extensively studied how large language models manipulate integers in specific arithmetic tasks, and on a more fundamental level, how they represent numeric values. These previous works have found that language model embeddings can be used to reconstruct the original values, however, they do not evaluate whether language models actually model continuous values as continuous. Using expected properties of the embedding space, including linear reconstruction and principal component analysis, we show that language models not only represent numeric spaces as non-continuous but also introduce significant noise. Using models from three major providers (OpenAI, Google Gemini and Voyage AI), we show that while reconstruction is possible with high fidelity ($R^2 \\geq 0.95$), principal components only explain a minor share of variation within the embedding space. This indicates that many components within the embedding space are orthogonal to the simple numeric input space. Further, both linear reconstruction and explained variance suffer with increasing decimal precision, despite the ordinal nature of the input space being fundamentally unchanged. The findings of this work therefore have implications for the many areas where embedding models are used, in-particular where high numerical precision, large magnitudes or mixed-sign values are common.",

However, exist mobile GUI agents predominantly privilege autonomous operation and neglect the necessity of active user engagement during task execution. This omission undermines their adaptability to information dilemmas including ambiguous, dynamically evolving, and conflicting task scenarios, leading to execution outcomes that deviate from genuine user requirements and preferences. To address these shortcomings, we propose ReInAgent, a context-aware multi-agent framework that leverages dynamic information management to enable human-in-the-loop mobile task navigation. ReInAgent integrates three specialized agents around a shared memory module: an information-managing agent for slot-based information management and proactive interaction with the user, a decision-making agent for conflict-aware planning, and a reflecting agent for task reflection and information consistency validation. Through continuous contextual information analysis and sustained user-agent collaboration, ReInAgent overcomes the limitation of existing approaches that rely on clear and static task assumptions. Consequently, it enables more adaptive and reliable mobile task navigation in complex, real-world scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that ReInAgent effectively resolves information dilemmas and produces outcomes that are more closely aligned with genuine user preferences. Notably, on complex tasks involving information dilemmas, ReInAgent achieves a 25% higher success rate than Mobile-Agent-v2.",

The recent emergence of large language models (LLMs), particularly their chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities, offers promising opportunities for developing relevance systems that are both more interpretable and more robust. However, existing training paradigms have notable limitations: SFT and DPO suffer from poor generalization on long-tail queries and from a lack of fine-grained, stepwise supervision to enforce rule-aligned reasoning. In contrast, reinforcement learning with verification rewards (RLVR) suffers from sparse feedback, which provides insufficient signal to correct erroneous intermediate steps, thereby undermining logical consistency and limiting performance in complex inference scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce the Stepwise Hybrid Examination Reinforcement Learning framework for Taobao Search Relevance (TaoSR-SHE). At its core is Stepwise Reward Policy Optimization (SRPO), a reinforcement learning algorithm that leverages step-level rewards generated by a hybrid of a high-quality generative stepwise reward model and a human-annotated offline verifier, prioritizing learning from critical correct and incorrect reasoning steps. TaoSR-SHE further incorporates two key techniques: diversified data filtering to encourage exploration across varied reasoning paths and mitigate policy entropy collapse, and multi-stage curriculum learning to foster progressive capability growth. Extensive experiments on real-world search benchmarks show that TaoSR-SHE improves both reasoning quality and relevance-prediction accuracy in large-scale e-commerce settings, outperforming SFT, DPO, GRPO, and other baselines, while also enhancing interpretability and robustness.",

Augur uses a two stage teacher student architecture where a powerful teacher LLM infers a directed causal graph from time series using heuristic search together with pairwise causality testing. A lightweight student agent then refines the graph and fine tune on high confidence causal associations that are encoded as rich textual prompts to perform forecasting. This design improves predictive accuracy while yielding transparent, traceable reasoning about variable interactions.

At the heart of this shift is multi-vehicle dynamic navigation, which requires simultaneously routing large fleets under evolving traffic conditions. Existing path search algorithms and reinforcement learning methods struggle to scale to city-wide networks, often failing to capture the nonlinear, stochastic, and coupled dynamics of urban traffic. To address these challenges, we propose CityNav, a hierarchical, LLM-powered framework for large-scale multi-vehicle navigation. CityNav integrates a global traffic allocation agent, which coordinates strategic traffic flow distribution across regions, with local navigation agents that generate locally adaptive routes aligned with global directives. To enable effective cooperation, we introduce a cooperative reasoning optimization mechanism, in which agents are jointly trained with a dual-reward structure: individual rewards promote per-vehicle efficiency, while shared rewards encourage network-wide coordination and congestion reduction. Extensive experiments on four real-world road networks of varying scales (up to 1.6 million roads and 430,000 intersections) and traffic datasets demonstrate that CityNav consistently outperforms nine classical path search and RL-based baselines in city-scale travel efficiency and congestion mitigation. Our results highlight the potential of LLMs to enable scalable, adaptive, and cooperative city-wide traffic navigation, providing a foundation for intelligent, large-scale vehicle routing in complex urban environments.

To investigate this tension, we formulate a PursuitEvasion-Exposure-Concealment Game (PEEC) in which a pursuer agent must decide when to communicate in order to obtain the evader's position. Each communication reveals the pursuer's location, increasing the risk of being targeted. Both agents learn their movement policies via reinforcement learning, while the pursuer additionally learns a communication policy that balances observability and risk. We propose SHADOW (Strategic-communication Hybrid Action Decision-making under partial Observation for Warfare), a multi-headed sequential reinforcement learning framework that integrates continuous navigation control, discrete communication actions, and opponent modeling for behavior prediction. Empirical evaluations show that SHADOW pursuers achieve higher success rates than six competitive baselines. Our ablation study confirms that temporal sequence modeling and opponent modeling are critical for effective decision-making. Finally, our sensitivity analysis reveals that the learned policies generalize well across varying communication risks and physical asymmetries between agents.",

However, algorithms such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) suffer from a clear drawback: the upper bound of a model's rollout responses is entirely determined by the model itself, preventing the acquisition of knowledge from samples that are either all incorrect or all correct. In this paper, we introduce Group Contrastive Policy Optimization (GCPO), a method that incorporates external standard reference answers. When the model cannot solve a problem, the reference answer supplies the correct response, steering the model toward an unequivocally accurate update direction. This approach offers two main advantages: (1) it improves training efficiency by fully utilizing every sample; (2) it enables the model to emulate the problem solving strategy of the reference answer during training, thereby enhancing generalization in reasoning. GCPO achieves outstanding results across multiple benchmark datasets, yielding substantial improvements over the baseline model. Our code is available at: https://github.com/AchoWu/GCPO.",

        "summary": "Graph domain adaptation (GDA) has achieved great attention due to its effectiveness in addressing the domain shift between train and test data. A significant bottleneck in existing graph domain adaptation methods is their reliance on source-domain data, which is often unavailable due to privacy or security concerns. This limitation has driven the development of Test-Time Graph Domain Adaptation (TT-GDA), which aims to transfer knowledge without accessing the source examples. Inspired by the generative power of large language models (LLMs), we introduce a novel framework that reframes TT-GDA as a generative graph restoration problem, \"restoring the target graph to its pristine, source-domain-like state\". There are two key challenges: (1) We need to construct a reasonable graph restoration process and design an effective encoding scheme that an LLM can understand, bridging the modality gap. (2) We need to devise a mechanism to ensure the restored graph acquires the intrinsic features of the source domain, even without access to the source data. To ensure the effectiveness of graph restoration, we propose GRAIL, that restores the target graph into a state that is well-aligned with the source domain. Specifically, we first compress the node representations into compact latent features and then use a graph diffusion process to model the graph restoration process. Then a quantization module encodes the restored features into discrete tokens. Building on this, an LLM is fine-tuned as a generative restorer to transform a \"noisy\" target graph into a \"native\" one. To further improve restoration quality, we introduce a reinforcement learning process guided by specialized alignment and confidence rewards. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various datasets.",

To address this, we introduce the \"Haibu Mathematical-Medical Intelligent Agent\" (MMIA), an LLM-driven architecture that ensures reliability through a formally verifiable reasoning process. MMIA recursively breaks down complex medical tasks into atomic, evidence-based steps. This entire reasoning chain is then automatically audited for logical coherence and evidence traceability, similar to theorem proving. A key innovation is MMIA's \"bootstrapping\" mode, which stores validated reasoning chains as \"theorems.\" Subsequent tasks can then be efficiently solved using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), shifting from costly first-principles reasoning to a low-cost verification model. We validated MMIA across four healthcare administration domains, including DRG/DIP audits and medical insurance adjudication, using expert-validated benchmarks. Results showed MMIA achieved an error detection rate exceeding 98% with a false positive rate below 1%, significantly outperforming baseline LLMs. Furthermore, the RAG matching mode is projected to reduce average processing costs by approximately 85% as the knowledge base matures. In conclusion, MMIA's verifiable reasoning framework is a significant step toward creating trustworthy, transparent, and cost-effective AI systems, making LLM technology viable for critical applications in medicine.",

Existing approaches typically extract content from a large collection of related papers and prompt LLMs to summarize them directly. However, such methods often overlook the structural relationships among papers, resulting in generated surveys that lack a coherent taxonomy and a deeper contextual understanding of research progress. To address these shortcomings, we propose \\textbf{SurveyG}, an LLM-based agent framework that integrates \\textit{hierarchical citation graph}, where nodes denote research papers and edges capture both citation dependencies and semantic relatedness between their contents, thereby embedding structural and contextual knowledge into the survey generation process. The graph is organized into three layers: \\textbf{Foundation}, \\textbf{Development}, and \\textbf{Frontier}, to capture the evolution of research from seminal works to incremental advances and emerging directions. By combining horizontal search within layers and vertical depth traversal across layers, the agent produces multi-level summaries, which are consolidated into a structured survey outline. A multi-agent validation stage then ensures consistency, coverage, and factual accuracy in generating the final survey. Experiments, including evaluations by human experts and LLM-as-a-judge, demonstrate that SurveyG outperforms state-of-the-art frameworks, producing surveys that are more comprehensive and better structured to the underlying knowledge taxonomy of a field.",

        "summary": "In real-time and safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPSs), control synthesis must guarantee that generated policies meet stringent timing and correctness requirements under uncertain and dynamic conditions. Signal temporal logic (STL) has emerged as a powerful formalism of expressing real-time constraints, with its semantics enabling quantitative assessment of system behavior. Meanwhile, reinforcement learning (RL) has become an important method for solving control synthesis problems in unknown environments. Recent studies incorporate STL-based reward functions into RL to automatically synthesize control policies. However, the automatically inferred rewards obtained by these methods represent the global assessment of a whole or partial path but do not accumulate the rewards of local changes accurately, so the sparse global rewards may lead to non-convergence and unstable training performances. In this paper, we propose an online reward generation method guided by the online causation monitoring of STL. Our approach continuously monitors system behavior against an STL specification at each control step, computing the quantitative distance toward satisfaction or violation and thereby producing rewards that reflect instantaneous state dynamics. Additionally, we provide a smooth approximation of the causation semantics to overcome the discontinuity of the causation semantics and make it differentiable for using deep-RL methods. We have implemented a prototype tool and evaluated it in the Gym environment on a variety of continuously controlled benchmarks. Experimental results show that our proposed STL-guided RL method with online causation semantics outperforms existing relevant STL-guided RL methods, providing a more robust and efficient reward generation framework for deep-RL.",

The importance of sufficiently presenting novel actions has widely been acknowledged for improving long-term user engagement. A recent work builds on Off-Policy Learning (OPL), which trains a policy from only logged data, however, the existing methods can be unsafe in the presence of novel actions. Our goal is to develop a framework to enforce exploration of novel actions with a guarantee for safety. To this end, we first develop Safe Off-Policy Policy Gradient (Safe OPG), which is a model-free safe OPL method based on a high confidence off-policy evaluation. In our first experiment, we observe that Safe OPG almost always satisfies a safety requirement, even when existing methods violate it greatly. However, the result also reveals that Safe OPG tends to be too conservative, suggesting a difficult tradeoff between guaranteeing safety and exploring novel actions. To overcome this tradeoff, we also propose a novel framework called Deployment-Efficient Policy Learning for Safe User Exploration, which leverages safety margin and gradually relaxes safety regularization during multiple (not many) deployments. Our framework thus enables exploration of novel actions while guaranteeing safe implementation of recommender systems.",

AgentAsk follows a three-stage pipeline: (i) distilling edge-level judgments from curated failure traces into a compact policy, (ii) supervising the policy to determine when/what/whom/how to ask, and (iii) optimizing online with E-GRPO, a reinforcement learning objective that balances accuracy, latency, and cost. The module is architecture-agnostic and easy to integrate into existing orchestration. Across math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks, AgentAsk consistently improves accuracy and robustness over public multi-agent implementations while keeping overhead minimal, with latency and extra cost all less than 5%, approaching the performance of a strong evaluator.

        "summary": "The meteoric rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI), with its rapidly expanding market capitalization, presents both transformative opportunities and critical challenges. Chief among these is the urgent need for a new, unified paradigm for trustworthy evaluation, as current benchmarks increasingly reveal critical vulnerabilities. Issues like data contamination and selective reporting by model developers fuel hype, while inadequate data quality control can lead to biased evaluations that, even if unintentionally, may favor specific approaches. As a flood of participants enters the AI space, this \"Wild West\" of assessment makes distinguishing genuine progress from exaggerated claims exceptionally difficult. Such ambiguity blurs scientific signals and erodes public confidence, much as unchecked claims would destabilize financial markets reliant on credible oversight from agencies like Moody's. In high-stakes human examinations (e.g., SAT, GRE), substantial effort is devoted to ensuring fairness and credibility; why settle for less in evaluating AI, especially given its profound societal impact? This position paper argues that the current laissez-faire approach is unsustainable. We contend that true, sustainable AI advancement demands a paradigm shift: a unified, live, and quality-controlled benchmarking framework robust by construction, not by mere courtesy and goodwill. To this end, we dissect the systemic flaws undermining today's AI evaluation, distill the essential requirements for a new generation of assessments, and introduce PeerBench, a community-governed, proctored evaluation blueprint that embodies this paradigm through sealed execution, item banking with rolling renewal, and delayed transparency.

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong abilities in reasoning and problem solving, but recent studies reveal that they still struggle with time series reasoning tasks, where outputs are often affected by hallucination or knowledge leakage. In this work we propose TS-Agent, a time series reasoning agent that leverages LLMs strictly for what they excel at, i.e., gathering evidence and synthesizing it into conclusions through step-by-step reasoning, while delegating the extraction of statistical and structural information to time series analytical tools. Instead of mapping time series into text tokens, images, or embeddings, our agent interacts with raw numeric sequences through atomic operators, records outputs in an explicit evidence log, and iteratively refines its reasoning under the guidance of a self-critic and a final quality gate. This design avoids multi-modal alignment training, preserves the native form of time series, ensures interpretability and verifiability, and mitigates knowledge leakage or hallucination. Empirically, we evaluate the agent on established benchmarks. Our experiments show that TS-Agent achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLMs on understanding benchmarks, and delivers significant improvements on reasoning tasks, where existing models often rely on memorization and fail in zero-shot settings.",

While recent graph neural network approaches have advanced spatial temporal modeling, existing mixture of experts frameworks like Time Enhanced Spatio Temporal Attention Model (TESTAM) lack explicit incorporation of physical road network topology, limiting their spatial capabilities. We present TESTAM+, an enhanced spatio temporal forecasting framework that introduces a novel SpatioSemantic Expert integrating physical road topology with data driven feature similarity through hybrid graph construction. TESTAM+ achieves significant improvements over TESTAM: 1.3% MAE reduction on METR LA (3.10 vs. 3.14) and 4.1% improvement on PEMS BAY (1.65 vs. 1.72). Through comprehensive ablation studies, we discover that strategic expert selection fundamentally outperforms naive ensemble aggregation. Individual experts demonstrate remarkable effectiveness: the Adaptive Expert achieves 1.63 MAE on PEMS BAY, outperforming the original three expert TESTAM (1.72 MAE), while the SpatioSemantic Expert matches this performance with identical 1.63 MAE. The optimal Identity + Adaptive configuration achieves an 11.5% MAE reduction compared to state of the art MegaCRN on METR LA (2.99 vs. 3.38), while reducing inference latency by 53.1% compared to the full four expert TESTAM+. Our findings reveal that fewer, strategically designed experts outperform complex multi expert ensembles, establishing new state of the art performance with superior computational efficiency for real time deployment.",

However, most existing agents remain limited to static planning and brittle interactions, falling short of true collaboration or adaptive reasoning. We introduce ProSEA, a modular, general-purpose multi-agent framework designed for iterative problem solving through exploration and plan evolution. ProSEA features a hierarchical architecture in which a Manager Agent orchestrates domain-specialized Expert Agents, decomposes tasks, and adaptively replans based on structured feedback from failed attempts. Unlike prior systems, ProSEA agents report not only success or failure but also detailed reasons for failure and newly discovered constraints, enabling dynamic plan refinement informed by exploratory traces. The framework operates autonomously but supports seamless integration with human collaborators when needed. Experiments on the challenging FinanceBench benchmark demonstrate that ProSEA, even without human feedback, outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and achieves robust performance across reasoning-heavy tasks. These results underscore ProSEA's potential as a foundation for more transparent, adaptive, and human-aligned AI agents.",

In particular, AI can efficiently conduct frequent, low-level experience sampling from patients and facilitate diagnostic reconciliation across care pathways. We envision a future where mental health care benefits from continuous, rich, and patient-centered data sampling to dynamically adapt to individual patient needs and evolving conditions, thereby improving both accessibility and efficacy of treatment. We further propose the use of mental health digital twins (MHDTs) - continuously updated computational models that capture individual symptom dynamics and trajectories - as a transformative framework for personalized mental health care.

Despite consistent performance gains, it remains unclear to what extent thinking models learn entirely new reasoning capabilities or repurpose pre-existing base model ones. In this work, we propose a hybrid model where we activate reasoning mechanisms in base models at the right time to elicit thinking-model-level reasoning chains, implying that thinking models exploit already existing capabilities. To ground our analysis, we introduce an unsupervised, bottom-up approach for uncovering human-interpretable reasoning behaviors in thinking models. This approach provides an unbiased method to discover reasoning behaviors without imposing manual or LLM-derived assumptions. Across three base and four thinking models, using GSM8K and MATH500, our hybrid model recovers up to 91% of the performance gap to thinking models without any weight updates while steering only 12% of tokens. Concretely, our empirical setup provides a simple, causal way to test the effectiveness of existing reasoning mechanisms in base models by invoking them directly and measuring the resulting task performance. More broadly, these results reframe our understanding of how thinking models are trained: pre-training is when models acquire most of their reasoning mechanisms, and post-training teaches efficient deployment of these mechanisms at the right time, enabling efficient use of their inference-time compute.",

This paper introduces L2M-AID, a novel framework for Autonomous Industrial Defense using LLM-empowered, Multi-agent reinforcement learning. L2M-AID orchestrates a team of collaborative agents, each driven by a Large Language Model (LLM), to achieve adaptive and resilient security. The core innovation lies in the deep fusion of two AI paradigms: we leverage an LLM as a semantic bridge to translate vast, unstructured telemetry into a rich, contextual state representation, enabling agents to reason about adversary intent rather than merely matching patterns. This semantically-aware state empowers a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) algorithm, MAPPO, to learn complex cooperative strategies. The MARL reward function is uniquely engineered to balance security objectives (threat neutralization) with operational imperatives, explicitly penalizing actions that disrupt physical process stability. To validate our approach, we conduct extensive experiments on the benchmark SWaT dataset and a novel synthetic dataset generated based on the MITRE ATT&CK for ICS framework. Results demonstrate that L2M-AID significantly outperforms traditional IDS, deep learning anomaly detectors, and single-agent RL baselines across key metrics, achieving a 97.2% detection rate while reducing false positives by over 80% and improving response times by a factor of four. Crucially, it demonstrates superior performance in maintaining physical process stability, presenting a robust new paradigm for securing critical national infrastructure.",

        "summary": "Scaling data and models has played a pivotal role in the remarkable progress of computer vision and language. Inspired by these domains, recent efforts in robotics have similarly focused on scaling both data and model size to develop more generalizable and robust policies. However, unlike vision and language, robotics lacks access to internet-scale demonstrations across diverse robotic tasks and environments. As a result, the scale of existing datasets typically suffers from the need for manual data collection and curation. To address this problem, here we propose BLAZER, a framework that learns manipulation policies from automatically generated training data. We build on the zero-shot capabilities of LLM planners and automatically generate demonstrations for diverse manipulation tasks in simulation. Successful examples are then used to finetune an LLM and to improve its planning capabilities without human supervision. Notably, while BLAZER training requires access to the simulator's state, we demonstrate direct transfer of acquired skills to sensor-based manipulation. Through extensive experiments, we show BLAZER to significantly improve zero-shot manipulation in both simulated and real environments. Moreover, BLAZER improves on tasks outside of its training pool and enables downscaling of LLM models. Our code and data will be made publicly available on the project page.",

Most existing methods assume in-distribution tasks or rely on fine-tuning with embodiment-matched data, limiting transfer across platforms.

Given a task description, NovaFlow synthesizes a video using a video generation model and distills it into 3D actionable object flow using off-the-shelf perception modules. From the object flow, it computes relative poses for rigid objects and realizes them as robot actions via grasp proposals and trajectory optimization. For deformable objects, this flow serves as a tracking objective for model-based planning with a particle-based dynamics model. By decoupling task understanding from low-level control, NovaFlow naturally transfers across embodiments. We validate on rigid, articulated, and deformable object manipulation tasks using a table-top Franka arm and a Spot quadrupedal mobile robot, and achieve effective zero-shot execution without demonstrations or embodiment-specific training.

Current video benchmarks predominantly target general scenarios where perception/recognition is heavily relied on, while with relatively simple reasoning tasks, leading to saturation and thus failing to effectively evaluate advanced multimodal cognitive skills. To address this critical gap, we introduce SciVideoBench, a rigorous benchmark specifically designed to assess advanced video reasoning in scientific contexts. SciVideoBench consists of 1,000 carefully crafted multiple-choice questions derived from cutting-edge scientific experimental videos spanning over 25 specialized academic subjects and verified by a semi-automatic system. Each question demands sophisticated domain-specific knowledge, precise spatiotemporal perception, and intricate logical reasoning, effectively challenging models' higher-order cognitive abilities. Our evaluation highlights significant performance deficits in state-of-the-art proprietary and open-source LMMs, including Gemini 2.5 Pro and Qwen2.5-VL, indicating substantial room for advancement in video reasoning capabilities. Detailed analyses of critical factors such as reasoning complexity and visual grounding provide valuable insights and clear direction for future developments in LMMs, driving the evolution of truly capable multimodal AI co-scientists.

Existing approaches for memory-persistent VLN face critical limitations: they lack effective memory access mechanisms, instead relying on entire memory incorporation or fixed-horizon lookup, and predominantly store only environmental observations while neglecting navigation behavioral patterns that encode valuable decision-making strategies. We present Memoir, which employs imagination as a retrieval mechanism grounded by explicit memory: a world model imagines future navigation states as queries to selectively retrieve relevant environmental observations and behavioral histories. The approach comprises: 1) a language-conditioned world model that imagines future states serving dual purposes: encoding experiences for storage and generating retrieval queries; 2) Hybrid Viewpoint-Level Memory that anchors both observations and behavioral patterns to viewpoints, enabling hybrid retrieval; and 3) an experience-augmented navigation model that integrates retrieved knowledge through specialized encoders. Extensive evaluation across diverse memory-persistent VLN benchmarks with 10 distinctive testing scenarios demonstrates Memoir's effectiveness: significant improvements across all scenarios, with 5.4% SPL gains on IR2R over the best memory-persistent baseline, accompanied by 8.3x training speedup and 74% inference memory reduction. The results validate that predictive retrieval of both environmental and behavioral memories enables more effective navigation, with analysis indicating substantial headroom (73.3% vs 93.4% upper bound) for this imagination-guided paradigm.

However, a principled understanding of why it works has been lacking. This paper builds a theoretical foundation for RLVR by analyzing its training process at both the full-response (trajectory) and token levels. Central to our analysis is a quantity called the Gradient Gap, which formalizes the direction of improvement from low-reward to high-reward regions of the response space. We prove that convergence critically depends on aligning the update direction with this Gradient Gap. Moreover, we derive a sharp step-size threshold based on the magnitude of the Gradient Gap: below it, learning converges, whereas above it, performance collapses. Our theory further predicts how the critical step size must scale with response length and the success rate, thereby explaining why practical heuristics such as length normalization improve stability and showing that, with a fixed learning rate, the success rate can stagnate strictly below $100\\%$. We validate these predictions through controlled bandit simulations and LLM experiments, including training Qwen2.5-7B with GRPO.",

Applying the framework, we classify eight standard activations (ReLU, leaky-ReLU, tanh, sigmoid, Swish, GELU, Mish, TeLU), proving sharp distinctions between saturating, linear-growth, and smooth families. Numerical Gauss-Hermite and Monte Carlo validation confirms theoretical predictions. Our framework provides principled design guidance, moving activation choice from trial-and-error to provable stability and kernel conditioning.",

        "summary": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) leverage the graph structure to transmit information between nodes, typically through the message-passing mechanism. While these models have found a wide variety of applications, they are known to suffer from over-squashing, where information from a large receptive field of node representations is collapsed into a single fixed sized vector, resulting in an information bottleneck. In this paper, we re-examine the over-squashing phenomenon through the lens of model storage and retrieval capacity, which we define as the amount of information that can be stored in a node's representation for later use. We study some of the limitations of existing tasks used to measure over-squashing and introduce a new synthetic task to demonstrate that an information bottleneck can saturate this capacity. Furthermore, we adapt ideas from the sequence modeling literature on associative memories, fast weight programmers, and the xLSTM model to develop a novel GNN architecture with improved capacity. We demonstrate strong performance of this architecture both on our capacity synthetic task, as well as a range of real-world graph benchmarks.",

This forces agents to waste exploration and computational resources on irrelevant features, leading to sample-inefficient and unstable learning. To address this, inspired by human visual foveation, we introduce Gaze on the Prize. This framework augments visual RL with a learnable foveal attention mechanism (Gaze), guided by a self-supervised signal derived from the agent's experience pursuing higher returns (the Prize). Our key insight is that return differences reveal what matters most: If two similar representations produce different outcomes, their distinguishing features are likely task-relevant, and the gaze should focus on them accordingly. This is realized through return-guided contrastive learning that trains the attention to distinguish between the features relevant to success and failure. We group similar visual representations into positives and negatives based on their return differences and use the resulting labels to construct contrastive triplets. These triplets provide the training signal that teaches the attention mechanism to produce distinguishable representations for states associated with different outcomes. Our method achieves up to 2.4x improvement in sample efficiency and can solve tasks that the baseline fails to learn, demonstrated across a suite of manipulation tasks from the ManiSkill3 benchmark, all without modifying the underlying algorithm or hyperparameters.",

We argue that such widespread success can be more fully explained through more carefully considering data- or distribution-dependent perplexity, which acts as an effective prior and steers the optimization towards prompts that are more ``natural'' for the task at hand. We derive novel generalization bounds that are non-vacuous for data-scarce prompt optimization via more useful priors, formally analyzing how perplexity regularization tightens these bounds by limiting exploration. Empirically, we explore both the bounds' effectiveness and the practical benefits of perplexity regularization in improving prompt generalization.",

Their strong generalisation abilities make them a promising component for automated driving systems, which must handle unexpected corner cases. However, to be trusted in such safety-critical applications, a model must first possess a reliable perception system. Moreover, since critical objects and agents in traffic scenes are often at a distance, we require systems that are not \"shortsighted\", i.e., systems with strong perception capabilities at both close (up to 20 meters) and long (30+ meters) range. With this in mind, we introduce Distance-Annotated Traffic Perception Question Answering (DTPQA), the first Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmark focused solely on perception-based questions in traffic scenes, enriched with distance annotations. By excluding questions that require reasoning, we ensure that model performance reflects perception capabilities alone. Since automated driving hardware has limited processing power and cannot support large VLMs, our study centers on smaller VLMs. More specifically, we evaluate several state-of-the-art (SOTA) small VLMs on DTPQA and show that, despite the simplicity of the questions, these models significantly underperform compared to humans (~60% average accuracy for the best-performing small VLM versus ~85% human performance). However, it is important to note that the human sample size was relatively small, which imposes statistical limitations. We also identify specific perception tasks, such as distinguishing left from right, that remain particularly challenging for these models.",

Our main theoretical result establishes two statements. First, we prove tight bounds on embedding and value dimensions for single-layer attention-only transformers. Second, we show that if such a model achieves balanced logit displacement at lengths 1 and 2, then it must generalize to longer sequences, though with reduced precision. A mechanistic reading of the proof explains this limitation: as more tokens are attended to, softmax compresses logit displacements, eroding separation between valid and invalid outputs. Training dynamics also suggest a second obstacle: when many next tokens are possible, updates become noisy. We hypothesize that dropout can counteract the first effect and Exponential Moving Average (EMA) the second. We validate these hypotheses through random hyperparameter search on the set complement task, which confirms both mechanisms. We then test OthelloGPT, a GPT-1 style model trained on random Othello moves, and find that EMA again improves length generalization in this more complex setting.",

To address this, we establish a foundation for multivariate counterfactual identification using continuous-time flows, including non-Markovian settings under standard criteria. We characterise the conditions under which flow matching yields a unique, monotone and rank-preserving counterfactual transport map with tools from dynamic optimal transport, ensuring consistent inference.

Despite achieving high-quality results for common benchmarks with curated data, outputs often degrade for data that contain per image variations such as strong exposure changes, present, e.g., in most scenes with indoor and outdoor areas or rooms with windows. In this paper, we introduce Neural Exposure Fields (NExF), a novel technique for robustly reconstructing 3D scenes with high quality and 3D-consistent appearance from challenging real-world captures. In the core, we propose to learn a neural field predicting an optimal exposure value per 3D point, enabling us to optimize exposure along with the neural scene representation. While capture devices such as cameras select optimal exposure per image/pixel, we generalize this concept and perform optimization in 3D instead. This enables accurate view synthesis in high dynamic range scenarios, bypassing the need of post-processing steps or multi-exposure captures. Our contributions include a novel neural representation for exposure prediction, a system for joint optimization of the scene representation and the exposure field via a novel neural conditioning mechanism, and demonstrated superior performance on challenging real-world data. We find that our approach trains faster than prior works and produces state-of-the-art results on several benchmarks improving by over 55% over best-performing baselines.",

This work investigates political bias and stereotype propa- gation across eight prominent LLMs using the two-dimensional Political Compass Test (PCT). Initially, the PCT is employed to assess the in- herent political leanings of these models. Sub- sequently, persona prompting with the PCT is used to explore explicit stereotypes across vari- ous social dimensions. In a final step, implicit stereotypes are uncovered by evaluating mod- els with multilingual versions of the PCT. Key findings reveal a consistent left-leaning polit- ical alignment across all investigated models. Furthermore, while the nature and extent of stereotypes vary considerably between models, implicit stereotypes elicited through language variation are more pronounced than those iden- tified via explicit persona prompting. Interest- ingly, for most models, implicit and explicit stereotypes show a notable alignment, suggest- ing a degree of transparency or \"awareness\" regarding their inherent biases.

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning (RL) is a powerful paradigm for learning to make sequences of decisions. However, RL has yet to be fully leveraged in robotics, principally due to its lack of scalability. Offline RL offers a promising avenue by training agents on large, diverse datasets, avoiding the costly real-world interactions of online RL. Scaling offline RL to increasingly complex datasets requires expressive generative models such as diffusion and flow matching. However, existing methods typically depend on either backpropagation through time (BPTT), which is computationally prohibitive, or policy distillation, which introduces compounding errors and limits scalability to larger base policies. In this paper, we consider the question of how to develop a scalable offline RL approach without relying on distillation or backpropagation through time. We introduce Expressive Value Learning for Offline Reinforcement Learning (EVOR): a scalable offline RL approach that integrates both expressive policies and expressive value functions. EVOR learns an optimal, regularized Q-function via flow matching during training. At inference-time, EVOR performs inference-time policy extraction via rejection sampling against the expressive value function, enabling efficient optimization, regularization, and compute-scalable search without retraining. Empirically, we show that EVOR outperforms baselines on a diverse set of offline RL tasks, demonstrating the benefit of integrating expressive value learning into offline RL.",

        "summary": "In the shipping industry, fuel consumption and emissions are critical factors due to their significant impact on economic efficiency and environmental sustainability. Accurate prediction of ship fuel consumption is essential for further optimization of maritime operations. However, heterogeneous methodologies and limited high-quality datasets hinder direct comparison of modeling approaches. This paper makes three key contributions: (1) we introduce and release a new dataset (https://huggingface.co/datasets/krohnedigital/FuelCast) comprising operational and environmental data from three ships; (2) we define a standardized benchmark covering tabular regression and time-series regression (3) we investigate the application of in-context learning for ship consumption modeling using the TabPFN foundation model - a first in this domain to our knowledge. Our results demonstrate strong performance across all evaluated models, supporting the feasibility of onboard, data-driven fuel prediction. Models incorporating environmental conditions consistently outperform simple polynomial baselines relying solely on vessel speed. TabPFN slightly outperforms other techniques, highlighting the potential of foundation models with in-context learning capabilities for tabular prediction. Furthermore, including temporal context improves accuracy.",

        "summary": "Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) tasks, such as insect and bird identification, demand sensitivity to subtle visual cues while remaining robust to spatial transformations. A key challenge is handling geometric biases and noise, such as different orientations and scales of objects. Existing remedies rely on heavy data augmentation, which demands powerful models, or on equivariant architectures, which constrain expressivity and add cost. Canonicalization offers an alternative by shielding such biases from the downstream model. In practice, such functions are often obtained using canonicalization priors, which assume aligned training data. Unfortunately, real-world datasets never fulfill this assumption, causing the obtained canonicalizer to be brittle. We propose a bootstrapping algorithm that iteratively re-aligns training samples by progressively reducing variance and recovering the alignment assumption. We establish convergence guarantees under mild conditions for arbitrary compact groups, and show on four FGVC benchmarks that our method consistently outperforms equivariant, and canonicalization baselines while performing on par with augmentation.",

Our approach uses Shannon entropy from token-level logprobs as a confidence signal to enable early stopping, achieving 25-50% computational savings while maintaining task accuracy. Crucially, we demonstrate that entropy-based confidence calibration represents an emergent property of advanced post-training optimization present in modern reasoning models but notably absent in standard instruction-tuned and pre-trained models (Llama 3.3 70B). We show that the entropy threshold to stop reasoning varies from model to model but can be calculated easily in one shot using only a few examples from existing reasoning datasets. Our results indicate that advanced reasoning models often know that they've gotten a correct answer early on, and that this emergent confidence awareness can be exploited to save tokens and reduce latency. The framework demonstrates consistent performance across reasoning-optimized model families with 25-50% computational cost reduction while preserving accuracy, revealing that confidence mechanisms represent a distinguishing characteristic of modern post-trained reasoning systems versus their predecessors.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) often generate self-contradictory outputs, which severely impacts their reliability and hinders their adoption in practical applications. In video-language models (Video-LLMs), this phenomenon recently draws the attention of researchers. Specifically, these models fail to provide logically consistent responses to rephrased questions based on their grounding outputs. However, the underlying causes of this phenomenon remain underexplored. In this work, we adopt an interpretability-driven approach to analyze, statistically summarize, and intervention the potential factors of the phenomenon. We find that one of the primary reasons for the inconsistency in responses lies in the inability of cross-modal attention heads to effectively distinguish video tokens across different timestamps. To address this, we propose an attention enhancement method called Temporally Conditioned Attention Sharpening (TCAS), which constructs an enhancement objective based on attention distinctions to enhance the model's temporal resolution capability, thereby improving its temporal understanding logic consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the temporal logic consistency of Video-LLMs. Further interpretability analyses reveal that our method indeed improves the temporal discriminability of attention heads, validating our conclusions. Additionally, our method achieves performance improvements in general video temporal grounding tasks, highlighting that temporal logic consistency is a bottleneck in temporal understanding. By enhancing consistency, our method drives significant progress in video temporal understanding.",

        "summary": "Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong generalization capabilities, enabling them to recognize a wide range of objects across diverse domains without additional training. However, they often retain irrelevant information beyond the requirements of specific downstream tasks, raising concerns about computational efficiency and potential information leakage. This has motivated growing interest in approximate unlearning, which aims to selectively remove unnecessary knowledge while preserving overall model performance. Existing approaches to approximate unlearning have primarily focused on class unlearning, where a VLM is retrained to fail to recognize specified object classes while maintaining accuracy for others. However, merely forgetting object classes is often insufficient in practical applications. For instance, an autonomous driving system should accurately recognize real cars while avoiding misrecognition of illustrated cars depicted in roadside advertisements as real cars, which could be hazardous. In this paper, we introduce Approximate Domain Unlearning (ADU), a novel problem setting that requires reducing recognition accuracy for images from specified domains (e.g., illustration) while preserving accuracy for other domains (e.g., real). ADU presents new technical challenges: due to the strong domain generalization capability of pre-trained VLMs, domain distributions are highly entangled in the feature space, making naive approaches based on penalizing target domains ineffective. To tackle this limitation, we propose a novel approach that explicitly disentangles domain distributions and adaptively captures instance-specific domain information. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms baselines built upon VLM tuning techniques, paving the way for practical and fine-grained unlearning in VLMs. Code: https://kodaikawamura.github.io/Domain_Unlearning/.",

However, it has largely been neglected that decision-makers' mental models evolve through their continuous interaction with AI systems. This paper addresses this gap by conceptualizing how the design of human-AI collaboration influences the development of three complementary and interdependent mental models necessary for this collaboration. We develop an integrated socio-technical framework that identifies the mechanisms driving the mental model evolution: data contextualization, reasoning transparency, and performance feedback. Our work advances human-AI collaboration literature through three key contributions: introducing three distinct mental models (domain, information processing, complementarity-awareness); recognizing the dynamic nature of mental models; and establishing mechanisms that guide the purposeful design of effective human-AI collaboration.",

        "summary": "This paper presents a Multi Agent Bitcoin Trading system that utilizes Large Lan- guage Models (LLMs) for alpha generation and portfolio management in the cryptocur- rencies market. Unlike equities, cryptocurrencies exhibit extreme volatility and are heavily influenced by rapidly shifting market sentiments and regulatory announcements, making them difficult to model using static regression models or neural networks trained solely on historical data [53]. The proposed framework overcomes this by structuring LLMs into specialised agents for technical analysis, sentiment evaluation, decision-making, and performance reflection. The system improves over time through a novel verbal feedback mechanism where a Reflect agent provides daily and weekly natural-language critiques of trading decisions. These textual evaluations are then injected into future prompts, al- lowing the system to adjust indicator priorities, sentiment weights, and allocation logic without parameter updates or finetuning. Back-testing on Bitcoin price data from July 2024 to April 2025 shows consistent outperformance across market regimes: the Quantita- tive agent delivered over 30% higher returns in bullish phases and 15% overall gains versus buy-and-hold, while the sentiment-driven agent turned sideways markets from a small loss into a gain of over 100%. Adding weekly feedback further improved total performance by 31% and reduced bearish losses by 10%. The results demonstrate that verbal feedback represents a new, scalable, and low-cost method of tuning LLMs for financial goals.",

Existing compensation solutions, such as piecemeal licensing agreements, lack scalability and technical rigour, while current data attribution mechanisms provide only uncertain estimates and are rarely implemented in practice. This paper introduces a framework for a generative music infrastructure centred on direct attribution, transparent royalty distribution, and granular control for artists and rights' holders. We distinguish ontologically between the training set and the inference set, which allows us to propose two complementary forms of attribution: training-time attribution and inference-time attribution. We here favour inference-time attribution, as it enables direct, verifiable compensation whenever an artist's catalogue is used to condition a generated output. Besides, users benefit from the ability to condition generations on specific songs and receive transparent information about attribution and permitted usage. Our approach offers an ethical and practical solution to the pressing need for robust compensation mechanisms in the era of AI-generated music, ensuring that provenance and fairness are embedded at the core of generative systems.",

In this paper, we present Combined Uncertainty estimation for Reliable Embodied planning (CURE), which decomposes the uncertainty into epistemic and intrinsic uncertainty, each estimated separately. Furthermore, epistemic uncertainty is subdivided into task clarity and task familiarity for more accurate evaluation. The overall uncertainty assessments are obtained using random network distillation and multi-layer perceptron regression heads driven by LLM features. We validated our approach in two distinct experimental settings: kitchen manipulation and tabletop rearrangement experiments.

Recent research shows that it is highly susceptible to backdoor attacks, which introduce a hidden trigger into a single fine-tuned model instance that allows the adversary to control the output of the final merged model at inference time. In this work, we propose a simple framework for understanding backdoor attacks by treating the attack itself as a task vector. $Backdoor\\ Vector\\ (BV)$ is calculated as the difference between the weights of a fine-tuned backdoored model and fine-tuned clean model. BVs reveal new insights into attacks understanding and a more effective framework to measure their similarity and transferability. Furthermore, we propose a novel method that enhances backdoor resilience through merging dubbed $Sparse\\ Backdoor\\ Vector\\ (SBV)$ that combines multiple attacks into a single one. We identify the core vulnerability behind backdoor threats in MM: $inherent\\ triggers$ that exploit adversarial weaknesses in the base model. To counter this, we propose $Injection\\ BV\\ Subtraction\\ (IBVS)$ - an assumption-free defense against backdoors in MM. Our results show that SBVs surpass prior attacks and is the first method to leverage merging to improve backdoor effectiveness. At the same time, IBVS provides a lightweight, general defense that remains effective even when the backdoor threat is entirely unknown.",

        "summary": "Traditional bug tracking systems rely heavily on manual reporting, reproduction, triaging, and resolution, each carried out by different stakeholders such as end users, customer support, developers, and testers. This division of responsibilities requires significant coordination and widens the communication gap between non-technical users and technical teams, slowing the process from bug discovery to resolution. Moreover, current systems are highly asynchronous; users often wait hours or days for a first response, delaying fixes and contributing to frustration. This paper examines the evolution of bug tracking, from early paper-based reporting to today's web-based and SaaS platforms. Building on this trajectory, we propose an AI-powered bug tracking framework that augments existing tools with intelligent, large language model (LLM)-driven automation. Our framework addresses two main challenges: reducing time-to-fix and minimizing human overhead. Users report issues in natural language, while AI agents refine reports, attempt reproduction, and request missing details. Reports are then classified, invalid ones resolved through no-code fixes, and valid ones localized and assigned to developers. LLMs also generate candidate patches, with human oversight ensuring correctness. By integrating automation into each phase, our framework accelerates response times, improves collaboration, and strengthens software maintenance practices for a more efficient, user-centric future.",

        "summary": "Model pruning, i.e., removing a subset of model weights, has become a prominent approach to reducing the memory footprint of large language models (LLMs) during inference. Notably, popular inference engines, such as vLLM, enable users to conveniently prune downloaded models before they are deployed. While the utility and efficiency of pruning methods have improved significantly, the security implications of pruning remain underexplored. In this work, for the first time, we show that modern LLM pruning methods can be maliciously exploited. In particular, an adversary can construct a model that appears benign yet, once pruned, exhibits malicious behaviors. Our method is based on the idea that the adversary can compute a proxy metric that estimates how likely each parameter is to be pruned. With this information, the adversary can first inject a malicious behavior into those parameters that are unlikely to be pruned. Then, they can repair the model by using parameters that are likely to be pruned, effectively canceling out the injected behavior in the unpruned model. We demonstrate the severity of our attack through extensive evaluation on five models; after any of the pruning in vLLM are applied (Magnitude, Wanda, and SparseGPT), it consistently exhibits strong malicious behaviors in a diverse set of attack scenarios (success rates of up to $95.7\\%$ for jailbreak, $98.7\\%$ for benign instruction refusal, and $99.5\\%$ for targeted content injection). Our results reveal a critical deployment-time security gap and underscore the urgent need for stronger security awareness in model compression.",

While large-scale Transformer models like SwinIR have set the state of the art in performance, their high computational cost can be a barrier for practical applications. This paper investigates the critical trade-off between performance and efficiency by comparing the state-of-the-art SwinIR model against a standard, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on this challenging task. Our experimental results reveal a nuanced but important finding. While the Transformer-based SwinIR model achieves a higher peak performance, with a Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 39.03 dB, the lightweight CNN delivers a surprisingly competitive PSNR of 37.4 dB. Crucially, the CNN reached this performance after converging in only 10 epochs of training, whereas the more complex SwinIR model required 132 epochs. This efficiency is further underscored by the model's size; the CNN is over 55 times smaller than SwinIR. This work demonstrates that a standard CNN can provide a near state-of-the-art result with significantly lower computational overhead, presenting a compelling case for its use in real-world scenarios where resource constraints are a primary concern.",

        "summary": "Cardinality estimation is a fundamental task in database systems and plays a critical role in query optimization. Despite significant advances in learning-based cardinality estimation methods, most existing approaches remain difficult to generalize to new datasets due to their strong dependence on raw data or queries, thus limiting their practicality in real scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we argue that semantics in the schema may benefit cardinality estimation, and leveraging such semantics may alleviate these dependencies. To this end, we introduce ZeroCard, the first semantics-driven cardinality estimation method that can be applied without any dependence on raw data access, query logs, or retraining on the target database. Specifically, we propose to predict data distributions using schema semantics, thereby avoiding raw data dependence. Then, we introduce a query template-agnostic representation method to alleviate query dependence. Finally, we construct a large-scale query dataset derived from real-world tables and pretrain ZeroCard on it, enabling it to learn cardinality from schema semantics and predicate representations. After pretraining, ZeroCard's parameters can be frozen and applied in an off-the-shelf manner. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the distinct advantages of ZeroCard and show its practical applications in query optimization. Its zero-dependence property significantly facilitates deployment in real-world scenarios.",

        "summary": "Decentralized training removes the centralized server, making it a communication-efficient approach that can significantly improve training efficiency, but it often suffers from degraded performance compared to centralized training. Multi-Gossip Steps (MGS) serve as a simple yet effective bridge between decentralized and centralized training, significantly reducing experiment performance gaps. However, the theoretical reasons for its effectiveness and whether this gap can be fully eliminated by MGS remain open questions. In this paper, we derive upper bounds on the generalization error and excess error of MGS using stability analysis, systematically answering these two key questions. 1). Optimization Error Reduction: MGS reduces the optimization error bound at an exponential rate, thereby exponentially tightening the generalization error bound and enabling convergence to better solutions. 2). Gap to Centralization: Even as MGS approaches infinity, a non-negligible gap in generalization error remains compared to centralized mini-batch SGD ($\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{c\\beta}{c\\beta +1}}/{n m})$ in centralized and $\\mathcal{O}(T^{\\frac{2c\\beta}{2c\\beta +2}}/{n m^{\\frac{1}{2c\\beta +2}}})$ in decentralized). Furthermore, we provide the first unified analysis of how factors like learning rate, data heterogeneity, node count, per-node sample size, and communication topology impact the generalization of MGS under non-convex settings without the bounded gradients assumption, filling a critical theoretical gap in decentralized training. Finally, promising experiments on CIFAR datasets support our theoretical findings.",

To bridge this \"semantic-to-physical\" gap, we introduce GRACE, a novel framework that grounds VLM-based reasoning through executable analytic concepts (EAC)-mathematically defined blueprints that encode object affordances, geometric constraints, and semantics of manipulation. Our approach integrates a structured policy scaffolding pipeline that turn natural language instructions and visual information into an instantiated EAC, from which we derive grasp poses, force directions and plan physically feasible motion trajectory for robot execution. GRACE thus provides a unified and interpretable interface between high-level instruction understanding and low-level robot control, effectively enabling precise and generalizable manipulation through semantic-physical grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GRACE achieves strong zero-shot generalization across a variety of articulated objects in both simulated and real-world environments, without requiring task-specific training.",

        "summary": "Wearable EEG devices have emerged as a promising alternative to polysomnography (PSG). As affordable and scalable solutions, their widespread adoption results in the collection of massive volumes of unlabeled data that cannot be analyzed by clinicians at scale. Meanwhile, the recent success of deep learning for sleep scoring has relied on large annotated datasets. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers an opportunity to bridge this gap, leveraging unlabeled signals to address label scarcity and reduce annotation effort. In this paper, we present the first systematic evaluation of SSL for sleep staging using wearable EEG. We investigate a range of well-established SSL methods and evaluate them on two sleep databases acquired with the Ikon Sleep wearable EEG headband: BOAS, a high-quality benchmark containing PSG and wearable EEG recordings with consensus labels, and HOGAR, a large collection of home-based, self-recorded, and unlabeled recordings. Three evaluation scenarios are defined to study label efficiency, representation quality, and cross-dataset generalization. Results show that SSL consistently improves classification performance by up to 10% over supervised baselines, with gains particularly evident when labeled data is scarce. SSL achieves clinical-grade accuracy above 80% leveraging only 5% to 10% of labeled data, while the supervised approach requires twice the labels. Additionally, SSL representations prove robust to variations in population characteristics, recording environments, and signal quality. Our findings demonstrate the potential of SSL to enable label-efficient sleep staging with wearable EEG, reducing reliance on manual annotations and advancing the development of affordable sleep monitoring systems.",

Costly evaluation reduces inclusivity, slows the cycle of innovation, and worsens environmental impact. The typical approach follows two steps. First, select an anchor subset of data. Second, train a mapping from the accuracy on this subset to the final test result. The drawback is that anchor selection depends on clustering, which can be complex and sensitive to design choices. We argue that promoting diversity among samples is not essential; what matters is to select samples that $\\textit{maximise diversity in model responses}$. Our method, $\\textbf{Diversifying Sample Condensation (DISCO)}$, selects the top-k samples with the greatest model disagreements. This uses greedy, sample-wise statistics rather than global clustering. The approach is conceptually simpler. From a theoretical view, inter-model disagreement provides an information-theoretically optimal rule for such greedy selection. $\\textbf{DISCO}$ shows empirical gains over prior methods, achieving state-of-the-art results in performance prediction across MMLU, Hellaswag, Winogrande, and ARC.

However, the risk of drug-drug interactions (DDI) between co-prescribed medications remains a significant challenge. Previous studies have used graph neural networks (GNNs) to represent drug structures. Regardless, their simplified discrete forms cannot fully capture the molecular binding affinity and reactivity. Therefore, we propose Multimodal DDI Prediction with Molecular Electron Localization Function (ELF) Maps (MMM), a novel framework that integrates three-dimensional (3D) quantum-chemical information into drug representation learning. It generates 3D electron density maps using the ELF. To capture both therapeutic relevance and interaction risks, MMM combines ELF-derived features that encode global electronic properties with a bipartite graph encoder that models local substructure interactions. This design enables learning complementary characteristics of drug molecules. We evaluate MMM in the MIMIC-III dataset (250 drugs, 442 substructures), comparing it with several baseline models. In particular, a comparison with the GNN-based SafeDrug model demonstrates statistically significant improvements in the F1-score (p = 0.0387), Jaccard (p = 0.0112), and the DDI rate (p = 0.0386). These results demonstrate the potential of ELF-based 3D representations to enhance prediction accuracy and support safer combinatorial drug prescribing in clinical practice.",

Flow-based generative models have recently emerged as a promising solution to learning distributions of actions, offering one-step action generation and thus achieving much higher sampling efficiency compared to diffusion-based methods. However, existing flow-based policies suffer from representation collapse, the inability to distinguish similar visual representations, leading to failures in precise manipulation tasks. We propose DM1 (MeanFlow with Dispersive Regularization for One-Step Robotic Manipulation), a novel flow matching framework that integrates dispersive regularization into MeanFlow to prevent collapse while maintaining one-step efficiency. DM1 employs multiple dispersive regularization variants across different intermediate embedding layers, encouraging diverse representations across training batches without introducing additional network modules or specialized training procedures. Experiments on RoboMimic benchmarks show that DM1 achieves 20-40 times faster inference (0.07s vs. 2-3.5s) and improves success rates by 10-20 percentage points, with the Lift task reaching 99% success over 85% of the baseline. Real-robot deployment on a Franka Panda further validates that DM1 transfers effectively from simulation to the physical world. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage representation regularization to enable flow-based policies to achieve strong performance in robotic manipulation, establishing a simple yet powerful approach for efficient and robust manipulation.",

Additionally, few-shot anomaly detection methods based on GNNs are prone to noise interference, resulting in poor embedding quality and reduced model robustness. To address these challenges, we propose a novel meta-learning-based graph-level anomaly detection framework (MA-GAD), incorporating a graph compression module that reduces the graph size, mitigating noise interference while retaining essential node information. We also leverage meta-learning to extract meta-anomaly information from similar networks, enabling the learning of an initialization model that can rapidly adapt to new tasks with limited samples. This improves the anomaly detection performance on target graphs, and a bias network is used to enhance the distinction between anomalous and normal nodes. Our experimental results, based on four real-world biochemical datasets, demonstrate that MA-GAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods in graph-level anomaly detection under few-shot conditions.

        "summary": "The undesired memorization of sensitive information by Large Language Models (LLMs) has emphasized the need for safety mechanisms that can regulate model behavior. This has led to the development of machine unlearning techniques that enable models to precisely forget sensitive and unwanted information. For machine unlearning, first-order and second-order optimizer-based methods have shown significant progress in enabling LLMs to forget targeted information. However, in doing so, these approaches often compromise the model's original capabilities, resulting in unlearned models that struggle to retain their prior knowledge and overall utility. To address this, we propose Selective Influence Machine Unlearning (SIMU), a two-step framework that enhances second-order optimizer-based unlearning by selectively updating only the critical neurons responsible for encoding the forget-set. By constraining updates to these targeted neurons, SIMU achieves comparable unlearning efficacy while substantially outperforming current methods in retaining the model's original knowledge.",

Existing research often depends on conspicuous UI overlays, elevated permissions, or impractical threat models, limiting stealth and real-world applicability. In this paper, we present a practical and stealthy one-shot jailbreak attack that leverages in-app prompt injections: malicious applications embed short prompts in UI text that remain inert during human interaction but are revealed when an agent drives the UI via ADB (Android Debug Bridge). Our framework comprises three crucial components: (1) low-privilege perception-chain targeting, which injects payloads into malicious apps as the agent's visual inputs; (2) stealthy user-invisible activation, a touch-based trigger that discriminates agent from human touches using physical touch attributes and exposes the payload only during agent operation; and (3) one-shot prompt efficacy, a heuristic-guided, character-level iterative-deepening search algorithm (HG-IDA*) that performs one-shot, keyword-level detoxification to evade on-device safety filters. We evaluate across multiple LVLM backends, including closed-source services and representative open-source models within three Android applications, and we observe high planning and execution hijack rates in single-shot scenarios (e.g., GPT-4o: 82.5% planning / 75.0% execution). These findings expose a fundamental security vulnerability in current mobile agents with immediate implications for autonomous smartphone operation.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models leverage pretrained vision-language models (VLMs) to couple perception with robotic control, offering a promising path toward general-purpose embodied intelligence. However, current SOTA VLAs are primarily pretrained on multimodal tasks with limited relevance to embodied scenarios, and then finetuned to map explicit instructions to actions. Consequently, due to the lack of reasoning-intensive pretraining and reasoning-guided manipulation, these models are unable to perform implicit human intention reasoning required for complex, real-world interactions. To overcome these limitations, we propose \\textbf{IntentionVLA}, a VLA framework with a curriculum training paradigm and an efficient inference mechanism. Our proposed method first leverages carefully designed reasoning data that combine intention inference, spatial grounding, and compact embodied reasoning, endowing the model with both reasoning and perception capabilities. In the following finetuning stage, IntentionVLA employs the compact reasoning outputs as contextual guidance for action generation, enabling fast inference under indirect instructions. Experimental results show that IntentionVLA substantially outperforms $\\pi_0$, achieving 18\\% higher success rates with direct instructions and 28\\% higher than ECoT under intention instructions. On out-of-distribution intention tasks, IntentionVLA achieves over twice the success rate of all baselines, and further enables zero-shot human-robot interaction with 40\\% success rate. These results highlight IntentionVLA as a promising paradigm for next-generation human-robot interaction (HRI) systems.",

Existing methods rely on paired datasets or hand-crafted rewards, which limit scalability and generalization. We propose TrajSkill, a framework for Trajectory Conditioned Cross-embodiment Skill Transfer, enabling robots to acquire manipulation skills directly from human demonstration videos. Our key insight is to represent human motions as sparse optical flow trajectories, which serve as embodiment-agnostic motion cues by removing morphological variations while preserving essential dynamics. Conditioned on these trajectories together with visual and textual inputs, TrajSkill jointly synthesizes temporally consistent robot manipulation videos and translates them into executable actions, thereby achieving cross-embodiment skill transfer. Extensive experiments are conducted, and the results on simulation data (MetaWorld) show that TrajSkill reduces FVD by 39.6\\% and KVD by 36.6\\% compared with the state-of-the-art, and improves cross-embodiment success rate by up to 16.7\\%.

Multi-task learning offers a principled framework to train these tasks jointly through shared representations. However, existing multi-task optimization strategies are primarily guided by training dynamics and often generalize poorly in volatile bidding environments. To this end, we present Validation-Aligned Multi-task Optimization (VAMO), which adaptively assigns task weights based on the alignment between per-task training gradients and a held-out validation gradient, thereby steering updates toward validation improvement and better matching deployment objectives. We further equip the framework with a periodicity-aware temporal module and couple it with an advanced generative auto-bidding backbone to enhance cross-task transfer of seasonal structure and strengthen bidding performance. Meanwhile, we provide theoretical insights into the proposed method, e.g., convergence guarantee and alignment analysis. Extensive experiments on both simulated and large-scale real-world advertising systems consistently demonstrate significant improvements over typical baselines, illuminating the effectiveness of the proposed approach.",

        "summary": "Ultra-high dynamic range (UHDR) scenes exhibit significant exposure disparities between bright and dark regions. Such conditions are commonly encountered in nighttime scenes with light sources. Even with standard exposure settings, a bimodal intensity distribution with boundary peaks often emerges, making it difficult to preserve both highlight and shadow details simultaneously. RGB-based bracketing methods can capture details at both ends using short-long exposure pairs, but are susceptible to misalignment and ghosting artifacts. We found that a short-exposure image already retains sufficient highlight detail. The main challenge of UHDR reconstruction lies in denoising and recovering information in dark regions. In comparison to the RGB images, RAW images, thanks to their higher bit depth and more predictable noise characteristics, offer greater potential for addressing this challenge. This raises a key question: can we learn to see everything in UHDR scenes using only a single short-exposure RAW image? In this study, we rely solely on a single short-exposure frame, which inherently avoids ghosting and motion blur, making it particularly robust in dynamic scenes. To achieve that, we introduce UltraLED, a two-stage framework that performs exposure correction via a ratio map to balance dynamic range, followed by a brightness-aware RAW denoiser to enhance detail recovery in dark regions. To support this setting, we design a 9-stop bracketing pipeline to synthesize realistic UHDR images and contribute a corresponding dataset based on diverse scenes, using only the shortest exposure as input for reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that UltraLED significantly outperforms existing single-frame approaches. Our code and dataset are made publicly available at https://srameo.github.io/projects/ultraled.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capability in function-level code generation tasks. Unlike isolated functions, real-world applications demand reasoning over the entire software system: developers must orchestrate how different components interact, maintain consistency across states over time, and ensure the application behaves correctly within the lifecycle and framework constraints. Yet, no existing benchmark adequately evaluates whether LLMs can bridge this gap and construct entire software systems from scratch. To address this gap, we propose APPFORGE, a benchmark consisting of 101 software development problems drawn from real-world Android apps. Given a natural language specification detailing the app functionality, a language model is tasked with implementing the functionality into an Android app from scratch. Developing an Android app from scratch requires understanding and coordinating app states, lifecycle management, and asynchronous operations, calling for LLMs to generate context-aware, robust, and maintainable code. To construct APPFORGE, we design a multi-agent system to automatically summarize the main functionalities from app documents and navigate the app to synthesize test cases validating the functional correctness of app implementation. Following rigorous manual verification by Android development experts, APPFORGE incorporates the test cases within an automated evaluation framework that enables reproducible assessment without human intervention, making it easily adoptable for future research. Our evaluation on 12 flagship LLMs show that all evaluated models achieve low effectiveness, with the best-performing model (GPT-5) developing only 18.8% functionally correct applications, highlighting fundamental limitations in current models' ability to handle complex, multi-component software engineering challenges.",

However, under matched compute, recursive models with fewer parameters often lag behind non-recursive counterparts. By probing hidden states, we trace this performance gap to two primary bottlenecks: undifferentiated computation, where the core is forced to adopt a similar computational pattern at every iteration, and information overload, where long-lived and transient information must coexist in a single hidden state. To address the issues, we introduce a Memory-as-State-Highways (MeSH) scheme, which externalizes state management into an explicit memory buffer and employs lightweight routers to dynamically diversify computation across iterations. Probing visualizations confirm that MeSH successfully resolves the pathologies by inducing functional specialization across iterations. On the Pythia suite (160M-1.4B), MeSH-enhanced recursive transformers consistently improve over recursive baselines and outperforms its larger non-recursive counterpart at the 1.4B scale, improving average downstream accuracy by +1.06% with 33% fewer non-embedding parameters.

These temporally extended actions provide richer information than single-step actions and can be interpreted through the options framework via semi-Markov decision process Q-learning, enabling reduction of the effective planning horizon by considering longer sequences at once. However, directly adopting such sequences in actor-critic algorithms introduces excessive value overestimation, which we address through detached value learning that steers value estimates toward in-distribution actions that achieve high return in the offline dataset. We demonstrate that DEAS consistently outperforms baselines on complex, long-horizon tasks from OGBench and can be applied to enhance the performance of large-scale Vision-Language-Action models that predict action sequences, significantly boosting performance in both RoboCasa Kitchen simulation tasks and real-world manipulation tasks.",

In this paper, we take the first step toward providing a comprehensive review of reasoning-based backdoor attacks in LLMs by analyzing their underlying mechanisms, methodological frameworks, and unresolved challenges. Specifically, we introduce a new taxonomy that offers a unified perspective for summarizing existing approaches, categorizing reasoning-based backdoor attacks into associative, passive, and active.

Moreover, most existing models do not adaptively determine the number of iterations for optimization under varying deformation requirements across images, resulting in either premature termination or excessive iterations that degrades registration accuracy. To effectively mitigate the accumulation of anatomical misalignments, we propose the Feature-Enhanced Residual Module (FERM) as the core component of each decoding layer in the pyramid network. FERM comprises three sequential blocks that extract anatomical semantic features, learn to suppress irrelevant features, and estimate the final deformation field, respectively. To adaptively determine the number of iterations for varying images, we propose the dual-stage Threshold-Controlled Iterative (TCI) strategy. In the first stage, TCI assesses registration stability and with asserted stability, it continues with the second stage to evaluate convergence. We coin the model that integrates FERM and TCI as Threshold-Controlled Iterative Pyramid (TCIP). Extensive experiments on three public brain MRI datasets and one abdomen CT dataset demonstrate that TCIP outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) registration networks in terms of accuracy, while maintaining comparable inference speed and a compact model parameter size. Finally, we assess the generalizability of FERM and TCI by integrating them with existing registration networks and further conduct ablation studies to validate the effectiveness of these two proposed methods.",

Despite recent advances, most existing newsbased forecasting models represent all articles using sentiment scores or average embeddings that capture the general tone but fail to provide quantitative, context-aware explanations of the impacts of public sentiment on predictions. To address this limitation, we propose an interpretable keyword-guided network (IKNet), which is an explainable forecasting framework that models the semantic association between individual news keywords and stock price movements. The IKNet identifies salient keywords via FinBERTbased contextual analysis, processes each embedding through a separate nonlinear projection layer, and integrates their representations with the time-series data of technical indicators to forecast next-day closing prices. By applying Shapley Additive Explanations the model generates quantifiable and interpretable attributions for the contribution of each keyword to predictions. Empirical evaluations of S&P 500 data from 2015 to 2024 demonstrate that IKNet outperforms baselines, including recurrent neural networks and transformer models, reducing RMSE by up to 32.9% and improving cumulative returns by 18.5%.

        "summary": "While most reinforcement learning methods today flatten the distribution of future returns to a single scalar value, distributional RL methods exploit the return distribution to provide stronger learning signals and to enable applications in exploration and safe RL. While the predominant method for estimating the return distribution is by modeling it as a categorical distribution over discrete bins or estimating a finite number of quantiles, such approaches leave unanswered questions about the fine-grained structure of the return distribution and about how to distinguish states with high return uncertainty for decision-making. The key idea in this paper is to use modern, flexible flow-based models to estimate the full future return distributions and identify those states with high return variance. We do so by formulating a new flow-matching objective that generates probability density paths satisfying the distributional Bellman equation. Building upon the learned flow models, we estimate the return uncertainty of distinct states using a new flow derivative ODE. We additionally use this uncertainty information to prioritize learning a more accurate return estimation on certain transitions. We compare our method (Value Flows) with prior methods in the offline and online-to-online settings. Experiments on $37$ state-based and $25$ image-based benchmark tasks demonstrate that Value Flows achieves a $1.3\\times$ improvement on average in success rates.

        "summary": "Recommendation systems have traditionally relied on short-term engagement signals, such as clicks and likes, to personalize content. However, these signals are often noisy, sparse, and insufficient for capturing long-term user satisfaction and retention. We introduce Retentive Relevance, a novel content-level survey-based feedback measure that directly assesses users' intent to return to the platform for similar content. Unlike other survey measures that focus on immediate satisfaction, Retentive Relevance targets forward-looking behavioral intentions, capturing longer term user intentions and providing a stronger predictor of retention. We validate Retentive Relevance using psychometric methods, establishing its convergent, discriminant, and behavioral validity. Through large-scale offline modeling, we show that Retentive Relevance significantly outperforms both engagement signals and other survey measures in predicting next-day retention, especially for users with limited historical engagement. We develop a production-ready proxy model that integrates Retentive Relevance into the final stage of a multi-stage ranking system on a social media platform. Calibrated score adjustments based on this model yield substantial improvements in engagement, and retention, while reducing exposure to low-quality content, as demonstrated by large-scale A/B experiments. This work provides the first empirically validated framework linking content-level user perceptions to retention outcomes in production systems. We offer a scalable, user-centered solution that advances both platform growth and user experience. Our work has broad implications for responsible AI development.",

        "summary": "Dynamic trust evaluation in large, rapidly evolving graphs requires models that can capture changing relationships, express calibrated confidence, and resist adversarial manipulation. DGTEN (Deep Gaussian-based Trust Evaluation Network) introduces a unified graph framework that achieves all three by combining uncertainty-aware message passing, expressive temporal modeling, and built-in defenses against trust-targeted attacks. It represents nodes and edges as Gaussian distributions so that both semantic signals and epistemic uncertainty propagate through the graph neural network, enabling risk-aware trust decisions rather than overconfident guesses. To model how trust evolves, it employs hybrid Absolute-Gaussian-Hourglass (HAGH) positional encoding with Kolmogorov-Arnold network-based unbiased multi-head attention, followed by an ordinary differential equation (ODE)-based residual learning module to jointly capture abrupt shifts and smooth trends. Robust adaptive ensemble coefficient analysis prunes or down-weights suspicious interactions using complementary cosine and Jaccard similarity measures, mitigating reputation laundering, sabotage, and on/off attacks. On two signed Bitcoin trust networks, DGTEN delivers significant improvements: in single-timeslot prediction on Bitcoin-Alpha, it improves MCC by 10.77% over the best dynamic baseline; in the cold-start scenario, it achieves a 16.41% MCC gain - the largest across all tasks and datasets. Under adversarial on/off attacks, it surpasses the baseline by up to 11.63% MCC. These results validate the effectiveness of the unified DGTEN framework.",

        "summary": "Well-designed open-source software drives progress in Machine Learning (ML) research. While static graph ML enjoys mature frameworks like PyTorch Geometric and DGL, ML for temporal graphs (TG), networks that evolve over time, lacks comparable infrastructure. Existing TG libraries are often tailored to specific architectures, hindering support for diverse models in this rapidly evolving field. Additionally, the divide between continuous- and discrete-time dynamic graph methods (CTDG and DTDG) limits direct comparisons and idea transfer. To address these gaps, we introduce Temporal Graph Modelling (TGM), a research-oriented library for ML on temporal graphs, the first to unify CTDG and DTDG approaches. TGM offers first-class support for dynamic node features, time-granularity conversions, and native handling of link-, node-, and graph-level tasks. Empirically, TGM achieves an average 7.8x speedup across multiple models, datasets, and tasks compared to the widely used DyGLib, and an average 175x speedup on graph discretization relative to available implementations. Beyond efficiency, we show in our experiments how TGM unlocks entirely new research possibilities by enabling dynamic graph property prediction and time-driven training paradigms, opening the door to questions previously impractical to study.

Additionally, some LNN variants outperform traditional RNN in terms of parameter efficiency and computational speed. However, RNN remains a cornerstone in sequence modeling due to its mature ecosystem and successful applications across various tasks. This review identifies the commonalities and differences between LNNs and RNNs, summarizes their respective shortcomings and challenges, and points out valuable directions for future research, particularly emphasizing the importance of improving the scalability of LNNs to promote their application in broader and more complex scenarios.",

        "summary": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) classification is a critical tool with widespread applications across diverse fields such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, medicine, and materials science. Due to the limited availability of high-quality training samples and the high dimensionality of spectral data, HSI classification models are prone to overfitting and often face challenges in balancing accuracy and computational complexity. Furthermore, most of HSI classification models are monomodal, where it solely relies on spectral-spatial data to learn decision boundaries in the high dimensional embedding space. To address this, we propose a general-purpose Semantic Spectral-Spatial Fusion Network (S3FN) that uses contextual, class specific textual descriptions to complement the training of an HSI classification model. Specifically, S3FN leverages LLMs to generate comprehensive textual descriptions for each class label that captures their unique characteristics and spectral behaviors. These descriptions are then embedded into a vector space using a pre-trained text encoder such as BERT or RoBERTa to extract meaningful label semantics which in turn leads to a better feature-label alignment for improved classification performance. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate our model on three diverse HSI benchmark datasets - Hyperspectral Wood, HyperspectralBlueberries, and DeepHS-Fruit and report significant performance boost. Our results highlight the synergy between textual semantics and spectral-spatial data, paving the way for further advancements in semantically augmented HSI classification models.

While humans can easily detect such implausibilities, there remains no robust method for quantitatively assessing physical realism in video. In this work, we explore whether Video-Language Models (VLMs) can be trained to serve as reliable judges of physical plausibility. We find that existing VLMs struggle to identify physics violations, exposing fundamental limitations in their temporal and causal reasoning. To address this, we introduce TRAVL, a fine-tuning recipe that combines a balanced training dataset with a trajectory-aware attention module to improve motion encoding and discrimination in VLMs. To evaluate physical reasoning more rigorously, we propose ImplausiBench, a benchmark of 300 videos (150 real, 150 generated) that removes linguistic biases and isolates visual-temporal understanding. Performance is reported both with gold-standard human judgments and stricter LLM-as-judge metrics. Together, TRAVL and ImplausiBench offer a unified framework for probing and improving physical plausibility in multimodal models, shedding light on a challenging and underexplored aspect of visual-temporal understanding.",

The continuous wavelet transform (CWT) generated time-frequency maps that capture both transient and oscillatory patterns across frequency bands relevant to sleep staging. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed wavelet-based representation, combined with ensemble learning, achieves an overall accuracy of 88.37 percent and a macro-averaged F1 score of 73.15, outperforming conventional machine learning methods and exhibiting comparable or superior performance to recent deep learning approaches.

Inspired by the way human analysts visually inspect time series to uncover hidden patterns, we ask: can incorporating visual representations enhance automated time-series analysis? Recent advances in multimodal large language models have demonstrated impressive generalization and visual understanding capability, yet their application to time series remains constrained by the modality gap between continuous numerical data and discrete natural language. To bridge this gap, we introduce MLLM4TS, a novel framework that leverages multimodal large language models for general time-series analysis by integrating a dedicated vision branch. Each time-series channel is rendered as a horizontally stacked color-coded line plot in one composite image to capture spatial dependencies across channels, and a temporal-aware visual patch alignment strategy then aligns visual patches with their corresponding time segments. MLLM4TS fuses fine-grained temporal details from the numerical data with global contextual information derived from the visual representation, providing a unified foundation for multimodal time-series analysis. Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of MLLM4TS across both predictive tasks (e.g., classification) and generative tasks (e.g., anomaly detection and forecasting). These results underscore the potential of integrating visual modalities with pretrained language models to achieve robust and generalizable time-series analysis.",

It also leads to substantial spatial misalignment between uLDCT and normal dose CT (NDCT) image pairs. This poses challenges for directly applying existing denoising networks trained on synthetic noise or aligned data. To address this core challenge in uLDCT denoising, this paper proposes an innovative denoising framework based on an Image Purification (IP) strategy. First, we construct a real clinical uLDCT lung dataset. Then, we propose an Image Purification strategy that generates structurally aligned uLDCT-NDCT image pairs, providing a high-quality data foundation for network training. Building upon this, we propose a Frequency-domain Flow Matching (FFM) model, which works synergistically with the IP strategy to excellently preserve the anatomical structure integrity of denoised images. Experiments on the real clinical dataset demonstrate that our IP strategy significantly enhances the performance of multiple mainstream denoising models on the uLDCT task. Notably, our proposed FFM model combined with the IP strategy achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in anatomical structure preservation. This study provides an effective solution to the data mismatch problem in real-world uLDCT denoising. Code and dataset are available at https://github.com/MonkeyDadLufy/flow-matching.",

Unlike prior approaches, HEMERA directly processes raw genotype data without clinical covariates, introducing additive positional encodings, neural genotype embeddings, and refined variant filtering. A post hoc explainability module based on Layer-wise Integrated Gradients enables attribution of model predictions to specific SNPs, aligning strongly with known LC risk loci.

Specifically, the grid path planning problem is mapped to the problem of finding the minimum quantum energy state. Two parallel QAOA circuits are built to simultaneously execute two solution processes, namely connectivity energy calculation and path energy calculation. A classical algorithm is employed to filter out unreasonable solutions of connectivity energy, and finally, the approximate optimal solution to the path planning problem is obtained by merging the calculation results of the two parallel circuits. The research findings indicate that by setting appropriate filter parameters, quantum states corresponding to position points with extremely low occurrence probabilities can be effectively filtered out, thereby increasing the probability of obtaining the target quantum state. Even when the circuit layer number p is only 1, the theoretical solution of the optimal path coding combination can still be found by leveraging the critical role of the filter. Compared with serial circuits, parallel circuits exhibit a significant advantage, as they can find the optimal feasible path coding combination with the highest probability.",

Two unsupervised diagnostics, the sharp jump in training loss and the rise in attention entropy, recover the critical temperature in excellent agreement with the exact value. Our results establish learnability as a data-driven marker of phase transitions and highlight deep parallels between long-range order in condensed matter and the emergence of structure in modern language models.",

We validate our approach on three surgical datasets across tasks including action recognition, tool presence detection, and laparoscope motion prediction.

However, in practice, the goal of inverse problem solving is not to cover the posterior but to recover the most accurate reconstruction, where optimization-based diffusion solvers often excel despite lacking a clear probabilistic foundation. We introduce Local MAP Sampling (LMAPS), a new inference framework that iteratively solving local MAP subproblems along the diffusion trajectory. This perspective clarifies their connection to global MAP estimation and DPS, offering a unified probabilistic interpretation for optimization-based methods. Building on this foundation, we develop practical algorithms with a probabilistically interpretable covariance approximation, a reformulated objective for stability and interpretability, and a gradient approximation for non-differentiable operators. Across a broad set of image restoration and scientific tasks, LMAPS achieves state-of-the-art performance, including $\\geq 2$ dB gains on motion deblurring, JPEG restoration, and quantization, and $>1.5$ dB improvements on inverse scattering benchmarks.",

        "summary": "Medical decision systems increasingly rely on data from multiple sources to ensure reliable and unbiased diagnosis. However, existing multimodal learning models fail to achieve this goal because they often ignore two critical challenges. First, various data modalities may learn unevenly, thereby converging to a model biased towards certain modalities. Second, the model may emphasize learning on certain demographic groups causing unfair performances. The two aspects can influence each other, as different data modalities may favor respective groups during optimization, leading to both imbalanced and unfair multimodal learning. This paper proposes a novel approach called MultiFair for multimodal medical classification, which addresses these challenges with a dual-level gradient modulation process. MultiFair dynamically modulates training gradients regarding the optimization direction and magnitude at both data modality and group levels. We conduct extensive experiments on two multimodal medical datasets with different demographic groups. The results show that MultiFair outperforms state-of-the-art multimodal learning and fairness learning methods.",

        "summary": "Overfitting remains a significant challenge in deep learning, often arising from data outliers, noise, and limited training data. To address this, we propose Divide2Conquer (D2C), a novel technique to mitigate overfitting. D2C partitions the training data into multiple subsets and trains identical models independently on each subset. To balance model generalization and subset-specific learning, the model parameters are periodically aggregated and averaged during training. This process enables the learning of robust patterns while minimizing the influence of outliers and noise. Empirical evaluations on benchmark datasets across diverse deep-learning tasks demonstrate that D2C significantly enhances generalization performance, particularly with larger datasets. Our analysis includes evaluations of decision boundaries, loss curves, and other performance metrics, highlighting D2C's effectiveness both as a standalone technique and in combination with other overfitting reduction methods. We further provide a rigorous mathematical justification for D2C's underlying principles and examine its applicability across multiple domains. Finally, we explore the trade-offs associated with D2C and propose strategies to address them, offering a holistic view of its strengths and limitations. This study establishes D2C as a versatile and effective approach to combating overfitting in deep learning. Our codes are publicly available at: https://github.com/Saiful185/Divide2Conquer.",

Is it possible to identify a pair of non-standard vector spaces for which a conventionally nonlinear function is, in fact, linear? This paper introduces a method that makes such vector spaces explicit by construction. We find that if we sandwich a linear operator $A$ between two invertible neural networks, $f(x)=g_y^{-1}(A g_x(x))$, then the corresponding vector spaces $X$ and $Y$ are induced by newly defined addition and scaling actions derived from $g_x$ and $g_y$. We term this kind of architecture a Linearizer. This framework makes the entire arsenal of linear algebra, including SVD, pseudo-inverse, orthogonal projection and more, applicable to nonlinear mappings. Furthermore, we show that the composition of two Linearizers that share a neural network is also a Linearizer. We leverage this property and demonstrate that training diffusion models using our architecture makes the hundreds of sampling steps collapse into a single step. We further utilize our framework to enforce idempotency (i.e. $f(f(x))=f(x)$) on networks leading to a globally projective generative model and to demonstrate modular style transfer.",

However, adapting reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning to DLMs remains an open challenge because of the intractable likelihood. Pioneering work such as diffu-GRPO estimated token-level likelihoods via one-step unmasking. While computationally efficient, this approach is severely biased. A more principled foundation lies in sequence-level likelihoods, where the evidence lower bound (ELBO) serves as a surrogate. Yet, despite this clean mathematical connection, ELBO-based methods have seen limited adoption due to the prohibitive cost of likelihood evaluation. In this work, we revisit ELBO estimation and disentangle its sources of variance. This decomposition motivates reducing variance through fast, deterministic integral approximations along a few pivotal dimensions. Building on this insight, we introduce \\textbf{Group Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO)}, a new RL algorithm tailored for DLMs. GDPO leverages simple yet effective Semi-deterministic Monte Carlo schemes to mitigate the variance explosion of ELBO estimators under vanilla double Monte Carlo sampling, yielding a provably lower-variance estimator under tight evaluation budgets. Empirically, GDPO achieves consistent gains over pretrained checkpoints and outperforms diffu-GRPO, one of the state-of-the-art baselines, on the majority of math, reasoning, and coding benchmarks.",

Our approach realizes an interpretable, diversity-preserving optimal policy as the regularization temperature vanishes and ensures the convergence of policy derived objects--value functions and return distributions. In a particular instance of our method, for example, the realized policy samples all optimal actions uniformly.

However, an overlooked yet potentially powerful question is: can one leverage auxiliary unpaired multimodal data to directly enhance representation learning in a target modality? We introduce UML: Unpaired Multimodal Learner, a modality-agnostic training paradigm in which a single model alternately processes inputs from different modalities while sharing parameters across them. This design exploits the assumption that different modalities are projections of a shared underlying reality, allowing the model to benefit from cross-modal structure without requiring explicit pairs. Theoretically, under linear data-generating assumptions, we show that unpaired auxiliary data can yield representations strictly more informative about the data-generating process than unimodal training. Empirically, we show that using unpaired data from auxiliary modalities -- such as text, audio, or images -- consistently improves downstream performance across diverse unimodal targets such as image and audio.

To resolve this conflict, we propose Direct Group Preference Optimization (DGPO), a new online RL algorithm that dispenses with the policy-gradient framework entirely. DGPO learns directly from group-level preferences, which utilize relative information of samples within groups. This design eliminates the need for inefficient stochastic policies, unlocking the use of efficient deterministic ODE samplers and faster training.

Visualizing the smallest sub-microscopic porosity vessels therefore requires the highest achievable resolution from confocal fluorescence microscopy, the current gold standard. This considerably limits the extent of the field of view to very small sample regions. To overcome this limitation, we tested different deep learning (DL) super-resolution (SR) models to allow faster experimental acquisitions of lower resolution images and restore optimal image quality by post-processing. Three supervised 2D SR models (RCAN, pix2pix, FSRCNN) and one unsupervised (CycleGAN) were applied to a unique set of experimentally paired high- and low-resolution confocal images acquired with different sampling schemes, resulting in a pixel size increase of x2, x4, x8. Model performance was quantified using a broad set of similarity and distribution-based image quality assessment (IQA) metrics, which yielded inconsistent results that mostly contradicted our visual perception. This raises the question of the relevance of such generic metrics to efficiently target the specific structure of dental porosity. To resolve this conflicting information, the generated SR images were segmented taking into account the specific scales and morphology of the porosity network and analysed by comparing connected components. Additionally, the capacity of the SR models to preserve 3D porosity connectivity throughout the confocal image stacks was evaluated using graph analysis. This biology-driven assessment allowed a far better mechanistic interpretation of SR performance, highlighting differences in model sensitivity to weak intensity features and the impact of non-linearity in image generation, which explains the failure of standard IQA metrics.",

Our method reformulates the generation process using a star-shaped paradigm, which inherently allows for error correction. To make this process effective, we augment it with a learnable re-masking scheduler that intelligently identifies and revises likely errors. This approach yields a substantial quality boost, particularly when using a small number of sampling steps. We extensively ablate key components of our approach and show its usability in different scenarios. In comprehensive experiments on text, and code generation, our sampling algorithm outperforms or matches existing methods.",

A popular approach, Learning to Defer (LtD), allows a Machine Learning (ML) model to pass difficult cases to a human expert. However, LtD treats humans and ML models as mutually exclusive decision-makers, restricting the expert contribution to mere predictions. To address this limitation, we propose Learning to Ask (LtA), a new framework that handles both when and how to incorporate expert input in an ML model. LtA is based on a two-part architecture: a standard ML model and an enriched model trained with additional expert human feedback, with a formally optimal strategy for selecting when to query the enriched model. We provide two practical implementations of LtA: a sequential approach, which trains the models in stages, and a joint approach, which optimises them simultaneously. For the latter, we design surrogate losses with realisable-consistency guarantees. Our experiments with synthetic and real expert data demonstrate that LtA provides a more flexible and powerful foundation for effective human-AI collaboration.",

However, RL algorithms that are well-suited for dLLMs' unique characteristics have yet to be developed.

DMPO exhibits superior performance on multiple reasoning benchmarks without supervised fine-tuning, with an accuracy improvement of up to $42.9\\%$ over previously SOTA baselines and $55.8\\%$ over the base model, underscoring the effectiveness of the distribution matching framework.

In a closed loop, the agent updates its beliefs over latent dynamics, samples plausible futures via Thompson sampling, and optimizes policies subject to preset risk tolerances. We establish regret bounds that converge to the Bayes-optimal benchmark under standard regularity conditions. We evaluate UAMDP in two domains-high-frequency equity trading and retail inventory control-both marked by structural uncertainty and economic volatility. Relative to strong deep learning baselines, UAMDP improves long-horizon forecasting accuracy (RMSE decreases by up to 25\\% and sMAPE by 32\\%), and these gains translate into economic performance: the trading Sharpe ratio rises from 1.54 to 1.74 while maximum drawdown is roughly halved.

In this paper, we introduce Post-hoc Stochastic Concept Bottleneck Models (PSCBMs), a lightweight method that augments any pre-trained CBM with a multivariate normal distribution over concepts by adding only a small covariance-prediction module, without retraining the backbone model. We propose two training strategies and show on real-world data that PSCBMs consistently match or improve both concept and target accuracy over standard CBMs at test time. Furthermore, we show that due to the modeling of concept dependencies, PSCBMs perform much better than CBMs under interventions, while remaining far more efficient than retraining a similar stochastic model from scratch.",

While methods exist for each issue, effectively combining them is non-trivial, as distinguishing genuine tail samples from noisy data proves difficult, often leading to conflicting optimization strategies. This paper presents a novel perspective: instead of primarily developing new complex techniques from scratch, we explore synergistically leveraging well-established, individually 'weak' auxiliary models - specialized for tackling either class imbalance or label noise but not both. This view is motivated by the insight that class imbalance (a distributional-level concern) and label noise (a sample-level concern) operate at different granularities, suggesting that robustness mechanisms for each can in principle offer complementary strengths without conflict. We propose Dual-granularity Sinkhorn Distillation (D-SINK), a novel framework that enhances dual robustness by distilling and integrating complementary insights from such 'weak', single-purpose auxiliary models. Specifically, D-SINK uses an optimal transport-optimized surrogate label allocation to align the target model's sample-level predictions with a noise-robust auxiliary and its class distributions with an imbalance-robust one. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that D-SINK significantly improves robustness and achieves strong empirical performance in learning from long-tailed noisy data.",

In this study, we dive into the essential model capacity impact under long-tailed context, and propose a novel framework, Model Rebalancing (MORE), which mitigates imbalance by directly rebalancing the model's parameter space. Specifically, MORE introduces a low-rank parameter component to mediate the parameter space allocation guided by a tailored loss and sinusoidal reweighting schedule, but without increasing the overall model complexity or inference costs. Extensive experiments on diverse long-tailed benchmarks, spanning multi-class and multi-label tasks, demonstrate that MORE significantly improves generalization, particularly for tail classes, and effectively complements existing imbalance mitigation methods.

Non-Autoregressive (NAR) models offer holistic, bidirectional representations but face challenges with generative coherence and scalability. To transcend this, we propose a hybrid framework enhancing AR generation by dynamically integrating rich contextual information from non-autoregressive mechanisms. Our approach couples a shared input encoder with two decoders: a non-autoregressive one learning latent bidirectional biological features, and an AR decoder synthesizing the biological sequence by leveraging these bidirectional features. A novel cross-decoder attention module enables the AR decoder to iteratively query and integrate these bidirectional features, enriching its predictions. This synergy is cultivated via a tailored training strategy with importance annealing for balanced objectives and cross-decoder gradient blocking for stable, focused learning. Evaluations on a demanding nine-species benchmark of de novo peptide sequencing show that our model substantially surpasses AR and NAR baselines. It uniquely harmonizes AR stability with NAR contextual awareness, delivering robust, superior performance on diverse downstream data. This research advances biological sequence modeling techniques and contributes a novel architectural paradigm for augmenting AR models with enhanced bidirectional understanding for complex sequence generation.

We propose Arbitrary Entropy Policy Optimization (AEPO), which eliminates entropy collapse by replacing entropy bonuses with REINFORCE policy gradient on temperature-adjusted distributions and stabilizing entropy through temperature regulation. AEPO integrates three key designs: policy gradient as regularization, distribution as regularization, and REINFORCE as regularization, enabling precise entropy control without distorting optimization. Experiments demonstrate three major contributions: AEPO (1) stabilizes entropy at arbitrary target levels, effectively removing collapse in GRPO; (2) reveals a non-monotonic relation where performance first improves then declines with increasing entropy, clarifying the link between entropy, exploration, and reasoning; and (3) generalizes beyond entropy, providing a broader RFT paradigm where superior target distributions can serve as REINFORCE regularizers.",

Modern serving systems adopt stall-free scheduling techniques such as chunked prefill, which splits long prompt processing along the token dimension and interleaves prefill with ongoing decode iterations. While effective at stabilizing TBT, chunked prefill incurs substantial overhead in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models: redundant expert weight loads increase memory traffic by up to 39% and inflate energy consumption. We propose layered prefill, a new scheduling paradigm that treats transformer layer groups as the primary scheduling unit. By vertically partitioning the model into contiguous layer groups and interleaving prefill and decode across the groups, layered prefill sustains stall-free decoding while eliminating chunk-induced MoE weight reloads. It reduces off-chip bandwidth demand, lowering TTFT by up to 70%, End-to-End latency by 41% and per-token energy by up to 22%. Evaluations show that layered prefill consistently improves the TTFT--TBT Pareto frontier over chunked prefill, reducing expert-load traffic and energy cost while maintaining stall-free decoding. Overall, shifting the scheduling axis from tokens to layers unlocks a new operating regime for high-efficiency, energy-aware LLM serving in co-located environments.",

        "summary": "Recently, Ainsworth et al. empirically demonstrated that, given two independently trained models, applying a parameter permutation that preserves the input-output behavior allows the two models to be connected by a low-loss linear path. When such a path exists, the models are said to achieve linear mode connectivity (LMC). Prior studies, including Ainsworth et al., have reported that achieving LMC requires not only an appropriate permutation search but also sufficiently wide models (e.g., a 32 $\\times$ width multiplier for ResNet-20). This is broadly believed to be because increasing the model width ensures a large enough space of candidate permutations, increasing the chance of finding one that yields LMC. In this work, we empirically demonstrate that, even without any permutations, simply widening the models is sufficient for achieving LMC when using a suitable softmax temperature calibration. We further explain why this phenomenon arises by analyzing intermediate layer outputs. Specifically, we introduce layerwise exponentially weighted connectivity (LEWC), which states that the output of each layer of the merged model can be represented as an exponentially weighted sum of the outputs of the corresponding layers of the original models. Consequently the merged model's output matches that of an ensemble of the original models, which facilitates LMC. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to show that widening the model not only facilitates nonlinear mode connectivity, as suggested in prior research, but also significantly increases the possibility of achieving linear mode connectivity.",

        "summary": "Radio maps are essential for enhancing wireless communications and localization. However, existing methods for constructing radio maps typically require costly calibration pro- cesses to collect location-labeled channel state information (CSI) datasets. This paper aims to recover the data collection trajectory directly from the channel propagation sequence, eliminating the need for location calibration. The key idea is to employ a hidden Markov model (HMM)-based framework to conditionally model the channel propagation matrix, while simultaneously modeling the location correlation in the trajectory. The primary challenges involve modeling the complex relationship between channel propagation in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) networks and geographical locations, and addressing both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) indoor conditions. In this paper, we propose an HMM-based framework that jointly characterizes the conditional propagation model and the evolution of the user trajectory. Specifically, the channel propagation in MIMO networks is modeled separately in terms of power, delay, and angle, with distinct models for LOS and NLOS conditions. The user trajectory is modeled using a Gaussian-Markov model. The parameters for channel propagation, the mobility model, and LOS/NLOS classification are optimized simultaneously. Experimental validation using simulated MIMO-Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) networks with a multi-antenna uniform linear arrays (ULA) configuration demonstrates that the proposed method achieves an average localization accuracy of 0.65 meters in an indoor environment, covering both LOS and NLOS regions. Moreover, the constructed radio map enables localization with a reduced error compared to conventional supervised methods, such as k-nearest neighbors (KNN), support vector machine (SVM), and deep neural network (DNN).",

Numerous computational costs have been invested in existing well-trained checkpoints, but many of them remain underutilized due to engineering constraints or limited model capacity. To efficiently reuse this \"sunk\" cost, we propose to recycle pretrained checkpoints by expanding their parameter counts and continuing training. We propose orthogonal growth method well-suited for converged Mixture-of-Experts model: interpositional layer copying for depth growth and expert duplication with injected noise for width growth. To determine the optimal timing for such growth across checkpoints sequences, we perform comprehensive scaling experiments revealing that the final accuracy has a strong positive correlation with the amount of sunk cost, indicating that greater prior investment leads to better performance. We scale our approach to models with 70B parameters and over 1T training tokens, achieving 10.66% accuracy gain over training from scratch under the same additional compute budget.

The efficacy of such predictions depends on two factors: (1) the similarity of the target gene to those covered in the training data, which informs model (epistemic) uncertainty, and (2) the quality of the corresponding training data, which reflects data (aleatoric) uncertainty. Both factors are critical for determining the reliability of a prediction, particularly as gene perturbation is an inherently stochastic biochemical process. In this paper, we propose PRESCRIBE (PREdicting Single-Cell Response wIth Bayesian Estimation), a multivariate deep evidential regression framework designed to measure both sources of uncertainty jointly. Our analysis demonstrates that PRESCRIBE effectively estimates a confidence score for each prediction, which strongly correlates with its empirical accuracy. This capability enables the filtering of untrustworthy results, and in our experiments, it achieves steady accuracy improvements of over 3% compared to comparable baselines.",

Recent studies have improved the performance of SNNs through knowledge distillation, but rely on large teacher models or introduce additional training overhead. In this paper, we show that SNNs can be naturally deconstructed into multiple submodels for efficient self-distillation. We treat each timestep instance of the SNN as a submodel and evaluate its output confidence, thus efficiently identifying the strong and the weak. Based on this strong and weak relationship, we propose two efficient self-distillation schemes: (1) \\textbf{Strong2Weak}: During training, the stronger \"teacher\" guides the weaker \"student\", effectively improving overall performance. (2) \\textbf{Weak2Strong}: The weak serve as the \"teacher\", distilling the strong in reverse with underlying dark knowledge, again yielding significant performance gains. For both distillation schemes, we offer flexible implementations such as ensemble, simultaneous, and cascade distillation. Experiments show that our method effectively improves the discriminability and overall performance of the SNN, while its adversarial robustness is also enhanced, benefiting from the stability brought by self-distillation. This ingeniously exploits the temporal properties of SNNs and provides insight into how to efficiently train high-performance SNNs.",

        "summary": "Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training without centralized servers, but remains vulnerable to Byzantine attacks where malicious clients submit corrupted model updates. Existing Byzantine-robust DFL defenses rely on similarity-based neighbor screening that requires every client to exchange and compare complete high-dimensional model vectors with all neighbors in each training round, creating prohibitive communication and computational costs that prevent deployment at web scale. We propose SketchGuard, a general framework that decouples Byzantine filtering from model aggregation through sketch-based neighbor screening. SketchGuard compresses $d$-dimensional models to $k$-dimensional sketches ($k \\ll d$) using Count Sketch for similarity comparisons, then selectively fetches full models only from accepted neighbors, reducing per-round communication complexity from $O(d|N_i|)$ to $O(k|N_i| + d|S_i|)$, where $|N_i|$ is the neighbor count and $|S_i| \\le |N_i|$ is the accepted neighbor count. We establish rigorous convergence guarantees in both strongly convex and non-convex settings, proving that Count Sketch compression preserves Byzantine resilience with controlled degradation bounds where approximation errors introduce only a $(1+O(\\epsilon))$ factor in the effective threshold parameter. Comprehensive experiments across multiple datasets, network topologies, and attack scenarios demonstrate that SketchGuard maintains identical robustness to state-of-the-art methods while reducing computation time by up to 82% and communication overhead by 50-70% depending on filtering effectiveness, with benefits scaling multiplicatively with model dimensionality and network connectivity. These results establish the viability of sketch-based compression as a fundamental enabler of robust DFL at web scale.",

The main idea of this study is to use a good SNR estimation technique and infuse a machine learning model to estimate NV of the SEM image, which then guides the wiener filter to remove the noise, providing a more robust and accurate SEM image filtering pipeline. First, we investigate five different SNR estimation techniques, namely Nearest Neighbourhood (NN) method, First-Order Linear Interpolation (FOL) method, Nearest Neighbourhood with First-Order Linear Interpolation (NN+FOL) method, Non-Linear Least Squares Regression (NLLSR) method, and Linear Least Squares Regression (LSR) method. It is shown that LSR method to perform better than the rest. Then, Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) are tested by pairing it with LSR. In this test, the Optimizable GPR model shows the highest accuracy and it stands as the most effective solution for NV estimation. Combining these results lead to the proposed Adaptive Optimizable Gaussian Process Regression Linear Least Squares Regression (AO-GPRLLSR) Filtering pipeline. The AO-GPRLLSR method generated an estimated noise variance which served as input to NV-guided Wiener filter for improving the quality of SEM images.

        "summary": "Sharpness (of the loss minima) is a common measure to investigate the generalization of neural networks. Intuitively speaking, the flatter the landscape near the minima is, the better generalization might be. Unfortunately, the correlation between many existing sharpness measures and the generalization is usually not strong, sometimes even weak. To close the gap between the intuition and the reality, we propose a novel sharpness measure, i.e., \\textit{Rényi sharpness}, which is defined as the negative Rényi entropy (a generalization of the classical Shannon entropy) of the loss Hessian. The main ideas are as follows: 1) we realize that \\textit{uniform} (identical) eigenvalues of the loss Hessian is most desirable (while keeping the sum constant) to achieve good generalization; 2) we employ the \\textit{Rényi entropy} to concisely characterize the extent of the spread of the eigenvalues of loss Hessian. Normally, the larger the spread, the smaller the (Rényi) entropy. To rigorously establish the relationship between generalization and (Rényi) sharpness, we provide several generalization bounds in terms of Rényi sharpness, by taking advantage of the reparametrization invariance property of Rényi sharpness, as well as the trick of translating the data discrepancy to the weight perturbation. Furthermore, extensive experiments are conducted to verify the strong correlation (in specific, Kendall rank correlation) between the Rényi sharpness and generalization. Moreover, we propose to use a variant of Rényi Sharpness as regularizer during training, i.e., Rényi Sharpness Aware Minimization (RSAM), which turns out to outperform all existing sharpness-aware minimization methods. It is worthy noting that the test accuracy gain of our proposed RSAM method could be as high as nearly 2.5\\%, compared against the classical SAM method.",

However, existing GFMs typically assume centralized access to multi-domain graphs, which is often infeasible due to privacy and institutional constraints. Federated Graph Foundation Models (FedGFMs) address this limitation, but their effectiveness fundamentally hinges on constructing a robust global codebook that achieves intra-domain coherence by consolidating mutually reinforcing semantics within each domain, while also maintaining inter-domain diversity by retaining heterogeneous knowledge across domains. To this end, we propose FedBook, a unified federated graph foundation codebook that systematically aggregates clients' local codebooks during server-side federated pre-training. FedBook follows a two-phase process: (1) Intra-domain Collaboration, where low-frequency tokens are refined by referencing more semantically reliable high-frequency tokens across clients to enhance domain-specific coherence; and (2) Inter-domain Integration, where client contributions are weighted by the semantic distinctiveness of their codebooks during the aggregation of the global GFM, thereby preserving cross-domain diversity. Extensive experiments on 8 benchmarks across multiple domains and tasks demonstrate that FedBook consistently outperforms 21 baselines, including isolated supervised learning, FL/FGL, federated adaptations of centralized GFMs, and FedGFM techniques.",

        "summary": "Location-Based Social Network (LBSN) check-in trajectory data are important for many practical applications, like POI recommendation, advertising, and pandemic intervention. However, the high collection costs and ever-increasing privacy concerns prevent us from accessing large-scale LBSN trajectory data. The recent advances in synthetic data generation provide us with a new opportunity to achieve this, which utilizes generative AI to generate synthetic data that preserves the characteristics of real data while ensuring privacy protection. However, generating synthetic LBSN check-in trajectories remains challenging due to their spatially discrete, temporally irregular nature and the complex spatio-temporal patterns caused by sparse activities and uncertain human mobility. To address this challenge, we propose GeoGen, a two-stage coarse-to-fine framework for large-scale LBSN check-in trajectory generation. In the first stage, we reconstruct spatially continuous, temporally regular latent movement sequences from the original LBSN check-in trajectories and then design a Sparsity-aware Spatio-temporal Diffusion model (S$^2$TDiff) with an efficient denosing network to learn their underlying behavioral patterns. In the second stage, we design Coarse2FineNet, a Transformer-based Seq2Seq architecture equipped with a dynamic context fusion mechanism in the encoder and a multi-task hybrid-head decoder, which generates fine-grained LBSN trajectories based on coarse-grained latent movement sequences by modeling semantic relevance and behavioral uncertainty. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that GeoGen excels state-of-the-art models for both fidelity and utility evaluation, e.g., it increases over 69% and 55% in distance and radius metrics on the FS-TKY dataset.",

They reduce dependence on sampling long graph random walks via a novel walk-stitching technique, concatenating several shorter walks without breaking unbiasedness. By applying these techniques, GRFs++ inherit the approximation quality provided by longer walks but with greater efficiency, trading sequential, inefficient sampling of a long walk for parallel computation of short walks and matrix-matrix multiplication. Furthermore, GRFs++ extend the simplistic GRFs walk termination mechanism (Bernoulli schemes with fixed halting probabilities) to a broader class of strategies, applying general distributions on the walks' lengths. This improves the approximation accuracy of graph kernels, without incurring extra computational cost.

However, SAFL faces significant challenges in optimizing both gradient-based (e.g., FedSGD) and model-based (e.g., FedAvg) aggregation strategies, which exhibit distinct trade-offs in accuracy, convergence speed, and stability. While gradient aggregation achieves faster convergence and higher accuracy, it suffers from pronounced fluctuations, whereas model aggregation offers greater stability but slower convergence and suboptimal accuracy. This paper presents FedQS, the first framework to theoretically analyze and address these disparities in SAFL. FedQS introduces a divide-and-conquer strategy to handle client heterogeneity by classifying clients into four distinct types and adaptively optimizing their local training based on data distribution characteristics and available computational resources. Extensive experiments on computer vision, natural language processing, and real-world tasks demonstrate that FedQS achieves the highest accuracy, attains the lowest loss, and ranks among the fastest in convergence speed, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Our work bridges the gap between aggregation strategies in SAFL, offering a unified solution for stable, accurate, and efficient federated learning.

Deep learning models have achieved remarkable results in various applications, but overfitting remains a common issue. Regularization techniques can help prevent overfitting by adding constraints to the model's parameters. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, in this paper we introduce a novel regularization technique based on inter-cluster separation (ICS) in the loss function, which penalizes the model for producing outputs that are far away from the centroids of the clusters formed by the data from previous tasks. We also performed hyperparameter tuning to find the optimal weighting of the proposed regularization term. This ensures clearer separation between tasks in the neural network's internal representation, reducing overlap and mitigating forgetting. Using the standard 5-task Split CIFAR-10 benchmark and a ResNet-18 architecture, we demonstrate ICS's effectiveness in maintaining strong performance on initial tasks. However, our results also highlight limitations in long-term knowledge retention, particularly when the number of tasks increases. This underscores the complexity and trade-offs inherent in continual learning and points toward avenues for further research.",

Although initial efforts have been made to address this trade-off in single-unit scenarios, these challenges have become more pronounced in the context of MABNI. In this paper, we establish, for the first time, a theoretical Pareto frontier characterizing the trade-off between regret minimization and inference accuracy in adversarial (design-based) MABNI.

This study addresses these issues through unsupervised deep learning. We introduce an incremental synthetic data benchmark designed to systematically evaluate model robustness against progressively complex challenges like speed variations, multi-channel inputs, and realistic noise patterns encountered in iSHM. Using this benchmark, we evaluate several established unsupervised models alongside our proposed Attention-Focused Transformer. Our model employs a self-attention mechanism, trained via reconstruction but innovatively deriving anomaly scores primarily from deviations in learned attention weights, aiming for both effectiveness and computational efficiency. Benchmarking results reveal that while transformer-based models generally outperform others, all tested models exhibit significant vulnerability to high-frequency localized noise, identifying this as a critical bottleneck for practical deployment. Notably, our proposed model achieves accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art solution while demonstrating better inference speed. This highlights the crucial need for enhanced noise robustness in future iSHM models and positions our more efficient attention-based approach as a promising foundation for developing practical onboard anomaly detection systems.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful reasoners in natural language, but their actions are typically confined to outputting vocabulary tokens. As a result, interactions with external environments -- such as symbolic operators or simulators -- must be expressed through text in predefined formats, parsed, and routed to external interfaces. This overloads the model's language with both reasoning and control duties, and requires a hand-crafted parser, external to the LLM. To address this, we decouple environment interactions from language by internalizing them in an Expanded Action space (ExpA), beyond the vocabulary. The model starts reasoning in the default language environment, but may trigger routing actions and switch to an external environment at any time. From there, the model can only invoke environment-specific actions, receive feedback from the environment, and potentially route back to language as a result. To promote effective exploration of the expanded action space and new environments, we introduce ExpA Reinforcement Learning (EARL) with counterfactual policy optimization. On tasks requiring multi-turn interactions and contingent planning, EARL outperforms strong baselines with vocabulary-constrained actions. It performs robustly across calculator-based multi-task learning and, in the partially observed sorting problem, achieves perfect Sort-4 accuracy while self-discovering an efficient algorithm competitive with classical designs.",

Genetic programming based techniques are the most common algorithms used to tackle this problem, but recently, neural-network based approaches have gained popularity. Most of the leading neural-network based models used for symbolic regression utilize transformer-based autoregressive models to generate an equation conditioned on encoded input points. However, autoregressive generation is limited to generating tokens left-to-right, and future generated tokens are conditioned only on previously generated tokens. Motivated by the desire to generate all tokens simultaneously to produce improved closed-form equations, we propose Symbolic Diffusion, a D3PM based discrete state-space diffusion model which simultaneously generates all tokens of the equation at once using discrete token diffusion. Using the bivariate dataset developed for SymbolicGPT, we compared our diffusion-based generation approach to an autoregressive model based on SymbolicGPT, using equivalent encoder and transformer architectures. We demonstrate that our novel approach of using diffusion-based generation for symbolic regression can offer comparable and, by some metrics, improved performance over autoregressive generation in models using similar underlying architectures, opening new research opportunities in neural-network based symbolic regression.",

It is known to improve performance in many settings, including in the large-scale training of language or vision models. As a first step towards understanding the role of dropout in large neural networks, we study the large-width asymptotics of gradient descent with dropout on two-layer neural networks with the mean-field initialization scale. We obtain a rich asymptotic phase diagram that exhibits five distinct nondegenerate phases depending on the relative magnitudes of the dropout rate, the learning rate, and the width. Notably, we find that the well-studied \"penalty\" effect of dropout only persists in the limit with impractically small learning rates of order $O(1/\\text{width})$. For larger learning rates, this effect disappears and in the limit, dropout is equivalent to a \"random geometry\" technique, where the gradients are thinned randomly after the forward and backward pass have been computed. In this asymptotic regime, the limit is described by a mean-field jump process where the neurons' update times follow independent Poisson or Bernoulli clocks (depending on whether the learning rate vanishes or not). For some of the phases, we obtain a description of the limit dynamics both in path-space and in distribution-space. The convergence proofs involve a mix of tools from mean-field particle systems and stochastic processes. Together, our results lay the groundwork for a renewed theoretical understanding of dropout in large-scale neural networks.",

This renders the construction of the FML-based tDT an entirely offline computational process. During online simulation, the learned tDT can efficiently predict and analyze the long-term dynamics of the QoIs without requiring simulations of the full DT system, thereby achieving substantial computational savings. After introducing the general numerical procedure, we demonstrate the construction and predictive capability of the tDT in a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) example: two-dimensional incompressible flow past a cylinder. The QoIs in this problem are the hydrodynamic forces exerted on the cylinder. The resulting tDTs are compact dynamical systems that evolve these forces without explicit knowledge of the underlying flow field.

Edges in real-world graphs often exhibit preferences for connecting certain pairs of groups. Biased connections can not only exacerbate but even induce unfair treatment for downstream graph-based tasks. We therefore consider group and individual fairness for graphs corresponding to group- and node-level definitions, respectively. To evaluate the fairness of a given graph, we provide multiple bias metrics, including novel measurements in the spectral domain. Furthermore, we propose Fair Spectral Templates (FairSpecTemp), an optimization-based method with two variants for estimating fair graphs from stationary graph signals, a general model for graph data subsuming many existing ones. One variant of FairSpecTemp exploits commutativity properties of graph stationarity while directly constraining bias, while the other implicitly encourages fair estimates by restricting bias in the graph spectrum and is thus more flexible. Our methods enjoy high probability performance bounds, yielding a conditional tradeoff between fairness and accuracy. In particular, our analysis reveals that accuracy need not be sacrificed to recover fair graphs. We evaluate FairSpecTemp on synthetic and real-world data sets to illustrate its effectiveness and highlight the advantages of both variants of FairSpecTemp.",

Our findings highlight the practical benefits of multimodal co-training as a structured approach to developing data-efficient and robust AI systems that can effectively generalize in dynamic, real-world environments. The theoretical foundations are examined in dialogue with, and in advance of, established co-training principles.",

However, despite their impressive capabilities, MAS remain susceptible to adversarial manipulation. Existing studies typically examine isolated attack surfaces or specific scenarios, leaving a lack of holistic understanding of MAS vulnerabilities. To bridge this gap, we introduce PEAR, a benchmark for systematically evaluating both the utility and vulnerability of planner-executor MAS. While compatible with various MAS architectures, our benchmark focuses on the planner-executor structure, which is a practical and widely adopted design. Through extensive experiments, we find that (1) a weak planner degrades overall clean task performance more severely than a weak executor; (2) while a memory module is essential for the planner, having a memory module for the executor does not impact the clean task performance; (3) there exists a trade-off between task performance and robustness; and (4) attacks targeting the planner are particularly effective at misleading the system. These findings offer actionable insights for enhancing the robustness of MAS and lay the groundwork for principled defenses in multi-agent settings.",

        "summary": "Over the years, significant contributions have been made by the research and industrial sectors to improve wearable devices towards the Internet of Wearable Things (IoWT) paradigm. However, wearables are still facing several challenges. Many stem from the limited battery power and insufficient computation resources available on wearable devices. On the other hand, with the popularity of smart wearables, there is a consistent increase in the development of new computationally intensive and latency-critical applications. In such a context, task offloading allows wearables to leverage the resources available on nearby edge devices to enhance the overall user experience. This paper proposes a framework for Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based task offloading in the IoWT. We formulate the task offloading process considering the tradeoff between energy consumption and task accomplishment time. Moreover, we model the task offloading problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and utilize the Q-learning technique to enable the wearable device to make optimal task offloading decisions without prior knowledge. We evaluate the performance of the proposed framework through extensive simulations for various applications and system configurations conducted in the ns-3 network simulator. We also show how varying the main system parameters of the Q-learning algorithm affects the overall performance in terms of average task accomplishment time, average energy consumption, and percentage of tasks offloaded.",

Unfortunately, as new design variables are added, the search space grows exponentially, which makes synthesizing and validating the properties of each material very impractical and time-consuming. In this work, we focus on the design of optimal lattice structures with regard to mechanical performance. Computational approaches, including the use of machine learning (ML) methods, have shown improved success in accelerating materials design. However, these ML methods are still lacking in scenarios when training data (i.e. experimentally validated materials) come from a non-uniformly random sampling across the design space. For example, an experimentalist might synthesize and validate certain materials more frequently because of convenience. For this reason, we suggest the use of tensor completion as a surrogate model to accelerate the design of materials in these atypical supervised learning scenarios. In our experiments, we show that tensor completion is superior to classic ML methods such as Gaussian Process and XGBoost with biased sampling of the search space, with around 5\\% increased $R^2$. Furthermore, tensor completion still gives comparable performance with a uniformly random sampling of the entire search space.",

Selecting the right LLM for each query is fundamentally an online decision problem: models differ in strengths, prices fluctuate, and users value accuracy and cost differently. Yet most routers are trained offline with labels for all candidate models, an assumption that breaks in deployment, where only the outcome of the chosen model is observed. We bridge this gap with BaRP, a Bandit-feedback Routing with Preferences approach that trains under the same partial-feedback restriction as deployment, while supporting preference-tunable inference: operators can dial the performance/cost trade-off at test time without retraining. Framed as a contextual bandit over prompt features and a user preference vector, our method simulates an online feedback setting during training and adapts its routing decisions to each new prompt, rather than depending on full-information offline supervision. Comprehensive experiments show that our method consistently outperforms strong offline routers by at least 12.46% and the largest LLM by at least 2.45%, and generalizes robustly for unseen tasks.",

While deep learning models have shown promise in yield prediction using satellite and weather data, their ability to generalize across geographic regions and years - critical for real-world deployment - remains largely untested. We benchmark two state-of-the-art models, GNN-RNN and MMST-ViT, under realistic out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions using the large-scale CropNet dataset spanning 1,200+ U.S. counties from 2017-2022. Through leave-one-cluster-out cross-validation across seven USDA Farm Resource Regions and year-ahead prediction scenarios, we identify substantial variability in cross-region transferability. GNN-RNN demonstrates superior generalization with positive correlations under geographic shifts, while MMST-ViT performs well in-domain but degrades sharply under OOD conditions. Regions like Heartland and Northern Great Plains show stable transfer dynamics (RMSE less than 10 bu/acre for soybean), whereas Prairie Gateway exhibits persistent underperformance (RMSE greater than 20 bu/acre) across both models and crops, revealing structural dissimilarities likely driven by semi-arid climate, irrigation patterns, and incomplete spectral coverage. Beyond accuracy differences, GNN-RNN achieves 135x faster training than MMST-ViT (14 minutes vs. 31.5 hours), making it more viable for sustainable deployment. Our findings underscore that spatial-temporal alignment - not merely model complexity or data scale - is key to robust generalization, and highlight the need for transparent OOD evaluation protocols to ensure equitable and reliable climate-aware agricultural forecasting.",

Multimodal graph neural networks (MGNNs) are well-suited to integrate complementary signals across modalities, thereby improving attack-prediction accuracy. However, designing an effective MGNN architecture is challenging because it requires coordinating modality-specific components at each layer, which is infeasible through manual tuning. Genetic algorithm (GA)-based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) provides a natural solution, yet existing methods are confined to single modalities and overlook modality heterogeneity. To address this limitation, we propose a modality-aware cooperative co-evolutionary algorithm for multimodal graph neural architecture search, termed MACC-MGNAS. First, we develop a modality-aware cooperative co-evolution (MACC) framework under a divide-and-conquer paradigm: a coordinator partitions a global chromosome population into modality-specific gene groups, local workers evolve them independently, and the coordinator reassembles chromosomes for joint evaluation. This framework effectively captures modality heterogeneity ignored by single-modality GNAS. Second, we introduce a modality-aware dual-track surrogate (MADTS) method to reduce evaluation cost and accelerate local gene evolution. Third, we design a similarity-based population diversity indicator (SPDI) strategy to adaptively balance exploration and exploitation, thereby accelerating convergence and avoiding local optima. On a standard vulnerabilities co-exploitation (VulCE) dataset, MACC-MGNAS achieves an F1-score of 81.67% within only 3 GPU-hours, outperforming the state-of-the-art competitor by 8.7% F1 while reducing computation cost by 27%.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained popularity in recent years, driving up the demand for inference. LLM inference is composed of two phases with distinct characteristics: a compute-bound prefill phase followed by a memory-bound decode phase. To efficiently serve LLMs, prior work proposes prefill-decode disaggregation to run each phase on separate hardware. However, existing hardware poorly matches the different requirements of each phase. Current datacenter GPUs and TPUs follow a more-is-better design philosophy that maximizes compute and memory resources, causing memory bandwidth underutilization in the prefill phase and compute underutilization in the decode phase. Such underutilization directly translates into increased serving costs. This paper proposes SPAD (Specialized Prefill and Decode hardware), adopting a less-is-more methodology to design specialized chips tailored to the distinct characteristics of prefill and decode phases. The proposed Prefill Chips have larger systolic arrays and use cost-effective GDDR memory, whereas the proposed Decode Chips retain high memory bandwidth but reduce compute capacity. Compared to modeled H100s, simulations show that the proposed Prefill Chips deliver 8% higher prefill performance on average at 52% lower hardware cost, while the proposed Decode Chips achieve 97% of the decode performance with 28% lower TDP. End-to-end simulations on production traces show that SPAD reduces hardware cost by 19%-41% and TDP by 2%-17% compared to modeled baseline clusters while offering the same performance. Even when models and workloads change, SPAD can reallocate either type of chip to run either phase and still achieve 11%-43% lower hardware costs, demonstrating the longevity of the SPAD design.",

Gaussian noise to the inhomogeneous case, where the noise has a variance profile. In particular, for the special case where the variance profile has a block structure, a series of results identified an effective spectral algorithm for detecting and estimating the signal, identified the threshold signal strength required for that algorithm to succeed, and proved information-theoretic lower bounds that, for some special signal distributions, match the above threshold. We complement these results by studying the computational optimality of this spectral algorithm. Namely, we show that, for a much broader range of signal distributions, whenever the spectral algorithm cannot detect a low-rank signal, then neither can any low-degree polynomial algorithm. This gives the first evidence for a computational hardness conjecture of Guionnet, Ko, Krzakala, and Zdeborová (2023). With similar techniques, we also prove sharp information-theoretic lower bounds for a class of signal distributions not treated by prior work. Unlike all of the above results on inhomogeneous models, our results do not assume that the variance profile has a block structure, and suggest that the same spectral algorithm might remain optimal for quite general profiles. We include a numerical study of this claim for an example of a smoothly-varying rather than piecewise-constant profile. Our proofs involve analyzing the graph sums of a matrix, which also appear in free and traffic probability, but we require new bounds on these quantities that are tighter than existing ones for non-negative matrices, which may be of independent interest.",

The challenge of having up to $n!$ such representations for graphs with $n$ nodes is only partially mitigated by using permutation-equivariant learning architectures. Despite their computational efficiency, existing graph diffusion models struggle to distinguish certain graph families, unless graph data are augmented with ad hoc features. This shortcoming stems from enforcing the inductive bias within the learning architecture. In this work, we leverage random matrix theory to analytically extract the spectral properties of the diffusion process, allowing us to push the inductive bias from the architecture into the dynamics. Building on this, we introduce the Dyson Diffusion Model, which employs Dyson's Brownian Motion to capture the spectral dynamics of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process on the adjacency matrix while retaining all non-spectral information. We demonstrate that the Dyson Diffusion Model learns graph spectra accurately and outperforms existing graph diffusion models.",

Such join conditions can be evaluated using large language models (LLMs) that solve novel tasks without task-specific training. Currently, many semantic query processing engines implement semantic joins via nested loops, invoking the LLM to evaluate the join condition on row pairs. Instead, this paper proposes a novel algorithm, inspired by the block nested loops join operator implementation in traditional database systems. The proposed algorithm integrates batches of rows from both input tables into a single prompt. The goal of the LLM invocation is to identify all matching row pairs in the current input. The paper introduces formulas that can be used to optimize the size of the row batches, taking into account constraints on the size of the LLM context window (limiting both input and output size). An adaptive variant of the proposed algorithm refers to cases in which the size of the output is difficult to estimate.

Operating directly on third-person videos of humans manipulating rigid objects, DexMan eliminates the need for camera calibration, depth sensors, scanned 3D object assets, or ground-truth hand and object motion annotations. Unlike prior approaches that consider only simplified floating hands, it directly controls a humanoid robot and leverages novel contact-based rewards to improve policy learning from noisy hand-object poses estimated from in-the-wild videos. DexMan achieves state-of-the-art performance in object pose estimation on the TACO benchmark, with absolute gains of 0.08 and 0.12 in ADD-S and VSD. Meanwhile, its reinforcement learning policy surpasses previous methods by 19% in success rate on OakInk-v2. Furthermore, DexMan can generate skills from both real and synthetic videos, without the need for manual data collection and costly motion capture, and enabling the creation of large-scale, diverse datasets for training generalist dexterous manipulation.",

Our method performs a one-time interpolation between the dense and pruned models in weight-space to compute a corrective term. This correction is used during inference by each pruned layer to recover lost capabilities with minimal overhead. GLUESTICK requires no additional training, is agnostic to the pruning algorithm, and introduces a single hyperparameter that controls the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy.

Specifically, they learn a continuous-time Markov process that efficiently maps samples from a simple source distribution into samples from a complex target distribution.

Moreover, we prove that the dynamics generated by this Hamiltonian can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. Together, these results give a quantum algorithm for preparing coherent encodings (a.k.a., qsamples) for a vast family of probability distributions--namely, those expressible by flow models--by reducing the task to an existing classical learning problem, plus Hamiltonian simulation. For statistical problems defined by flow models, such as mean estimation and property testing, this enables the use of quantum algorithms tailored to qsamples, which may offer advantages over classical algorithms based only on samples from a flow model. More broadly, these results reveal a close connection between state-of-the-art machine learning models, such as flow matching and diffusion models, and one of the main expected capabilities of quantum computers: simulating quantum dynamics.",

To overcome this limitation, a powerful pointwise estimator is introduced in this work that adaptively navigates both kinds of sparsity. Based on this pointwise estimator, a novel algorithm, termed HOPE, is proposed. Theoretical analyses demonstrate that HOPE not only achieves improved regret bounds in previously discussed homogeneous settings (i.e., considering only one type of sparsity) but also, for the first time, efficiently handles two new challenging heterogeneous settings (i.e., considering a mixture of two types of sparsity), highlighting its flexibility and generality.

        "summary": "This work represents the first effort to scale up continuous-time consistency distillation to general application-level image and video diffusion models. Although continuous-time consistency model (sCM) is theoretically principled and empirically powerful for accelerating academic-scale diffusion, its applicability to large-scale text-to-image and video tasks remains unclear due to infrastructure challenges in Jacobian-vector product (JVP) computation and the limitations of standard evaluation benchmarks. We first develop a parallelism-compatible FlashAttention-2 JVP kernel, enabling sCM training on models with over 10 billion parameters and high-dimensional video tasks. Our investigation reveals fundamental quality limitations of sCM in fine-detail generation, which we attribute to error accumulation and the \"mode-covering\" nature of its forward-divergence objective. To remedy this, we propose the score-regularized continuous-time consistency model (rCM), which incorporates score distillation as a long-skip regularizer. This integration complements sCM with the \"mode-seeking\" reverse divergence, effectively improving visual quality while maintaining high generation diversity. Validated on large-scale models (Cosmos-Predict2, Wan2.1) up to 14B parameters and 5-second videos, rCM matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art distillation method DMD2 on quality metrics while offering notable advantages in diversity, all without GAN tuning or extensive hyperparameter searches. The distilled models generate high-fidelity samples in only $1\\sim4$ steps, accelerating diffusion sampling by $15\\times\\sim50\\times$. These results position rCM as a practical and theoretically grounded framework for advancing large-scale diffusion distillation.",

In contrast to conventional arguments that justify early stopping for numerical stability, this phenomenon is intrinsic to the dimensionality reduction in LDMs. We provide a principled explanation by analyzing the interaction between latent dimension and stopping time. Under a Gaussian framework with linear autoencoders, we characterize the conditions under which early stopping is needed to minimize the distance between generated and target distributions. More precisely, we show that lower-dimensional representations benefit from earlier termination, whereas higher-dimensional latent spaces require later stopping time. We further establish that the latent dimension interplays with other hyperparameters of the problem such as constraints in the parameters of score matching. Experiments on synthetic and real datasets illustrate these properties, underlining that early stopping can improve generative quality. Together, our results offer a theoretical foundation for understanding how the latent dimension influences the sample quality, and highlight stopping time as a key hyperparameter in LDMs.",

Unfortunately, since models are usually trained solely based on samples from the original (unshifted) distribution, this performative shift may lead to decreased test-time performance. In this paper, we study the question of whether and when performative binary classification problems are learnable, via the lens of the classic PAC (Probably Approximately Correct) learning framework. We motivate several performative scenarios, accounting in particular for linear shifts in the label distribution, as well as for more general changes in both the labels and the features. We construct a performative empirical risk function, which depends only on data from the original distribution and on the type performative effect, and is yet an unbiased estimate of the true risk of a classifier on the shifted distribution. Minimizing this notion of performative risk allows us to show that any PAC-learnable hypothesis space in the standard binary classification setting remains PAC-learnable for the considered performative scenarios. We also conduct an extensive experimental evaluation of our performative risk minimization method and showcase benefits on synthetic and real data.",

Focusing on ground-based ATM systems, we evaluate two deep learning IDS implementations: one using a transformer encoder and the other an extended Long Short-Term Memory (xLSTM) network, marking the first xLSTM-based IDS for ADS-B. A transfer learning strategy was employed, involving pre-training on benign ADS-B messages and fine-tuning with labeled data containing instances of tampered messages. Results show this approach outperforms existing methods, particularly in identifying subtle attacks that progressively undermine situational awareness. The xLSTM-based IDS achieves an F1-score of 98.9%, surpassing the transformer-based model at 94.3%. Tests on unseen attacks validated the generalization ability of the xLSTM model. Inference latency analysis shows that the 7.26-second delay introduced by the xLSTM-based IDS fits within the Secondary Surveillance Radar (SSR) refresh interval (5-12 s), although it may be restrictive for time-critical operations. While the transformer-based IDS achieves a 2.1-second latency, it does so at the cost of lower detection performance.",

Besides heuristic principles such as \"synthetic data should be close to the real data distribution\", it is actually not clear which specific properties affect the generalization error. Our paper addresses this question through the lens of high-dimensional regression. Theoretically, we show that, for linear models, the covariance shift between the target distribution and the distribution of the synthetic data affects the generalization error but, surprisingly, the mean shift does not. Furthermore we prove that, in some settings, matching the covariance of the target distribution is optimal. Remarkably, the theoretical insights from linear models carry over to deep neural networks and generative models. We empirically demonstrate that the covariance matching procedure (matching the covariance of the synthetic data with that of the data coming from the target distribution) performs well against several recent approaches for synthetic data selection, across training paradigms, architectures, datasets and generative models used for augmentation.",

Deep learning (DL) based segmentation models may enable automated medical image analysis for detecting and delineating tumors in CT images, thereby reducing clinicians' workload. Achieving generalization capabilities in limited data domains, such as radiology, requires modern DL models to be trained with image augmentation. However, naively applying augmentation methods developed for natural images to CT scans often disregards the nature of the CT modality, where the intensities measure Hounsfield Units (HU) and have important physical meaning. This paper challenges the use of such intensity augmentations for CT imaging and shows that they may lead to artifacts and poor generalization. To mitigate this, we propose a CT-specific augmentation technique, called Random windowing, that exploits the available HU distribution of intensities in CT images. Random windowing encourages robustness to contrast-enhancement and significantly increases model performance on challenging images with poor contrast or timing. We perform ablations and analysis of our method on multiple datasets, and compare to, and outperform, state-of-the-art alternatives, while focusing on the challenge of liver tumor segmentation.",

However, existing evaluation metrics, which focus on semantic and temporal alignment, overlook a critical failure mode: models often generate acoustic events, particularly speech and music, that have no corresponding visual source. We term this phenomenon Insertion Hallucination and identify it as a systemic risk driven by dataset biases, such as the prevalence of off-screen sounds, that remains completely undetected by current metrics. To address this challenge, we first develop a systematic evaluation framework that employs a majority-voting ensemble of multiple audio event detectors. We also introduce two novel metrics to quantify the prevalence and severity of this issue: IH@vid (the fraction of videos with hallucinations) and IH@dur (the fraction of hallucinated duration). Building on this, we propose Posterior Feature Correction, a novel training-free inference-time method that mitigates IH. PFC operates in a two-pass process: it first generates an initial audio output to detect hallucinated segments, and then regenerates the audio after masking the corresponding video features at those timestamps. Experiments on several mainstream V2A benchmarks first reveal that state-of-the-art models suffer from severe IH. In contrast, our PFC method reduces both the prevalence and duration of hallucinations by over 50\\% on average, without degrading, and in some cases even improving, conventional metrics for audio quality and temporal synchronization. Our work is the first to formally define, systematically measure, and effectively mitigate Insertion Hallucination, paving the way for more reliable and faithful V2A models.",

However, detecting such videos faces significant challenges in modeling high-dimensional spatiotemporal dynamics and identifying subtle anomalies that violate physical laws. In this paper, we propose a physics-driven AI-generated video detection paradigm based on probability flow conservation principles. Specifically, we propose a statistic called Normalized Spatiotemporal Gradient (NSG), which quantifies the ratio of spatial probability gradients to temporal density changes, explicitly capturing deviations from natural video dynamics. Leveraging pre-trained diffusion models, we develop an NSG estimator through spatial gradients approximation and motion-aware temporal modeling without complex motion decomposition while preserving physical constraints. Building on this, we propose an NSG-based video detection method (NSG-VD) that computes the Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) between NSG features of the test and real videos as a detection metric. Last, we derive an upper bound of NSG feature distances between real and generated videos, proving that generated videos exhibit amplified discrepancies due to distributional shifts. Extensive experiments confirm that NSG-VD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 16.00% in Recall and 10.75% in F1-Score, validating the superior performance of NSG-VD.

Accurate nowcasting is of utmost importance for addressing various societal needs, including disaster management, agriculture, transportation, and energy optimization. As a complementary to existing non-autoregressive nowcasting approaches, we investigate the impact of prediction horizons on nowcasting models and propose SimCast, a novel training pipeline featuring a short-to-long term knowledge distillation technique coupled with a weighted MSE loss to prioritize heavy rainfall regions. Improved nowcasting predictions can be obtained without introducing additional overhead during inference. As SimCast generates deterministic predictions, we further integrate it into a diffusion-based framework named CasCast, leveraging the strengths from probabilistic models to overcome limitations such as blurriness and distribution shift in deterministic outputs. Extensive experimental results on three benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, achieving mean CSI scores of 0.452 on SEVIR, 0.474 on HKO-7, and 0.361 on MeteoNet, which outperforms existing approaches by a significant margin.",

However, conventional scenario-based, surrogate-assisted, and mathematical programming methods are not sufficiently scalable to be affordable and precise in large and complex cases. Here, a multi-level approach is proposed to accurately optimize resource-intensive, high-dimensional, and complex engineering problems under uncertainty with minimal resources. A non-intrusive, fast-scaling, Kriging-based surrogate is developed to map the combined design/parameter domain efficiently. Multiple surrogates are adaptively updated by hierarchical and orthogonal decomposition to leverage the fewer and most uncertainty-informed data.

However, the (minimax) optimality of MoM and its limitations under adversarial contamination remain unknown beyond the Gaussian case. In this paper, we present upper and lower bounds for the error of MoM under adversarial contamination for multiple classes of distributions. In particular, we show that MoM is (minimax) optimal in the class of distributions with finite variance, as well as in the class of distributions with infinite variance and finite absolute $(1+r)$-th moment.

We prove that this Fisher-tracking strategy achieves optimal performance in both fixed-confidence and fixed-budget regimes, which are commonly invested in the best-arm identification literature.

Although recent advances have improved the capacity to model diverse observation types, adoption in practice remains limited in industries that demand interpretability. To mitigate this gap, surrogate models that explain black-box predictors provide a promising path toward interpretable decision making. In this study, we propose a graph partitioning problem to construct spatial segments that minimize the sum of within-segment variances of individual predictions. The assignment of data points to segments can be formulated as a mixed-integer quadratic programming problem. While this formulation potentially enables the identification of exact segments, its computational complexity becomes prohibitive as the number of data points increases. Motivated by this challenge, we develop an approximation scheme that leverages the structural properties of graph partitioning.

Backend selection is gated by a conservative working-set estimate so that in-memory execution is chosen when safe, otherwise Dask is used. Across synthetic and public tabular benchmarks, the scheduler reduces p95 latency by 23 to 28 percent versus a tuned warm-up heuristic (and by 35 to 40 percent versus fixed grid baselines), while lowering peak memory by 16 to 22 percent (25 to 32 percent vs. fixed) with zero OOMs and comparable throughput.",

For fine-tuning, we focus particularly on generative retrieval, where the model is directly trained to generate Semantic IDs of recommended items based on user context.

Recent approaches using conformal prediction construct data-driven uncertainty sets with finite-sample coverage guarantees, but they still fix coverage targets a priori and offer little guidance for selecting robustness levels. We propose a new framework that provides distribution-free, finite-sample guarantees on both miscoverage and regret for any family of robust predict-then-optimize policies. Our method constructs valid estimators that trace out the miscoverage-regret Pareto frontier, enabling decision-makers to reliably evaluate and calibrate robustness levels according to their cost-risk preferences. The framework is simple to implement, broadly applicable across classical optimization formulations, and achieves sharper finite-sample performance than existing approaches. These results offer the first principled data-driven methodology for guiding robustness selection and empower practitioners to balance robustness and conservativeness in high-stakes decision-making.",

In this paper, we propose a new method to estimate the performance of a model trained on a specific (random) training set. A naive estimator can be obtained by applying the model to a disjoint testing set. Surprisingly, cross-validation estimators computed from other random splits can be used to improve this naive estimator within a random-effects model framework. We develop two estimators -- a hierarchical Bayesian estimator and an empirical Bayes estimator -- that perform similarly to or better than both the conventional cross-validation estimator and the naive single-split estimator.

However, these approaches depend on explicit reward signals, which are often unavailable in practice, leaving open the fundamental problem of how to align generative models when only high-quality datasets are accessible. In this work, we address this challenge via a Bilevel Optimization framework, where the reward function is treated as the optimization variable of an outer-level problem, while a policy gradient objective defines the inner-level. We then conduct a theoretical analysis of this optimization problem in a tractable setting and extract insights that, as we demonstrate, generalize to applications such as tabular classification and model-based reinforcement learning.

The recently proposed Hashing-based Efficient Point Transformer (HEPT) offers a theoretically guaranteed near-linear complexity for large point cloud processing via locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) in attention computations; however, its evaluations have largely focused on embedding quality, and the object condensation pipeline on which HEPT relies requires a post-hoc clustering step (e.g., DBScan) that can dominate runtime. In this work, we make two contributions. First, we present a unified, fair evaluation of physics tracking performance for HEPT and a representative GNN-based pipeline under the same dataset and metrics. Second, we introduce HEPTv2 by extending HEPT with a lightweight decoder that eliminates the clustering stage and directly predicts track assignments. This modification preserves HEPT's regular, hardware-friendly computations while enabling ultra-fast end-to-end inference. On the TrackML dataset, optimized HEPTv2 achieves approximately 28 ms per event on an A100 while maintaining competitive tracking efficiency.

We show that pairwise mean independence answers the question of how much one can relax independence: it is identifiable, any weaker notion is non-identifiable, and it contains the models previously studied as special cases. Our results apply to distributions with the required zero pattern at any cumulant tensor. We propose an algebraic recovery algorithm based on least-squares optimization over the orthogonal group.

This paper proposes a lightweight encoder-decoder model based on Gate Recurrent Unit layers to correlate the vehicle's future state with its past states, measured onboard, and control actions the driver performs. The results demonstrate that the model achieves a maximum mean relative error below 2.6% in extreme dynamic conditions.

The accuracy of this encoding critically depends on the distinguishability of multi-state outputs, which is often limited by suboptimal and empirically chosen reservoir operation conditions. In this work, we demonstrate a machine learning approach, Bayesian optimization, to improve the encoding fidelity of solution-processed Al2O3/In2O3 thin-film transistors (TFTs). We show high-fidelity 6-bit temporal encoding by exploring five key pulse parameters and using the normalized degree of separation (nDoS) as the metric of output state separability. Additionally, we show that a model trained on simpler 4-bit data can effectively guide optimization of more complex 6-bit encoding tasks, reducing experimental cost. Specifically, for the encoding and reconstruction of binary-patterned images of a moving car across 6 sequential frames, we demonstrate that the encoding is more accurate when operating the TFT using optimized pulse parameters and the 4-bit optimized operating condition performs almost as well as the 6-bit optimized condition. Finally, interpretability analysis via Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) reveals that gate pulse amplitude and drain voltage are the most influential parameters in achieving higher state separation. This work presents the first systematic method to identify optimal operating conditions for reservoir devices, and the approach can be extended to other physical reservoir implementations across different material platforms.",

        "summary": "Maritime object detection faces essential challenges due to the small target size and limitations of labeled real RGB data. This paper will present a real-time object detection system based on RT-DETR, enhanced by employing augmented synthetic images while strictly evaluating on real data. This study employs RT-DETR for the maritime environment by combining multi-scale feature fusion, uncertainty-minimizing query selection, and smart weight between synthetic and real training samples. The fusion module in DETR enhances the detection of small, low-contrast vessels, query selection focuses on the most reliable proposals, and the weighting strategy helps reduce the visual gap between synthetic and real domains. This design preserves DETR's refined end-to-end set prediction while allowing users to adjust between speed and accuracy at inference time. Data augmentation techniques were also used to balance the different classes of the dataset to improve the robustness and accuracy of the model. Regarding this study, a full Python robust maritime detection pipeline is delivered that maintains real-time performance even under practical limits. It also verifies how each module contributes, and how the system handles failures in extreme lighting or sea conditions. This study also includes a component analysis to quantify the contribution of each architectural module and explore its interactions.",

        "summary": "Neural encoding models aim to predict fMRI-measured brain responses to natural images. fMRI data is acquired as a 3D volume of voxels, where each voxel has a defined spatial location in the brain. However, conventional encoding models often flatten this volume into a 1D vector and treat voxel responses as independent outputs. This removes spatial context, discards anatomical information, and ties each model to a subject-specific voxel grid. We introduce the Neural Response Function (NRF), a framework that models fMRI activity as a continuous function over anatomical space rather than a flat vector of voxels. NRF represents brain activity as a continuous implicit function: given an image and a spatial coordinate (x, y, z) in standardized MNI space, the model predicts the response at that location. This formulation decouples predictions from the training grid, supports querying at arbitrary spatial resolutions, and enables resolution-agnostic analyses. By grounding the model in anatomical space, NRF exploits two key properties of brain responses: (1) local smoothness -- neighboring voxels exhibit similar response patterns; modeling responses continuously captures these correlations and improves data efficiency, and (2) cross-subject alignment -- MNI coordinates unify data across individuals, allowing a model pretrained on one subject to be fine-tuned on new subjects. In experiments, NRF outperformed baseline models in both intrasubject encoding and cross-subject adaptation, achieving high performance while reducing the data size needed by orders of magnitude. To our knowledge, NRF is the first anatomically aware encoding model to move beyond flattened voxels, learning a continuous mapping from images to brain responses in 3D space.",

        "summary": "Personalized image generation aims to faithfully preserve a reference subject's identity while adapting to diverse text prompts. Existing optimization-based methods ensure high fidelity but are computationally expensive, while learning-based approaches offer efficiency at the cost of entangled representations influenced by nuisance factors. We introduce SpotDiff, a novel learning-based method that extracts subject-specific features by spotting and disentangling interference. Leveraging a pre-trained CLIP image encoder and specialized expert networks for pose and background, SpotDiff isolates subject identity through orthogonality constraints in the feature space. To enable principled training, we introduce SpotDiff10k, a curated dataset with consistent pose and background variations. Experiments demonstrate that SpotDiff achieves more robust subject preservation and controllable editing than prior methods, while attaining competitive performance with only 10k training samples.",

        "summary": "Wuchereria bancrofti, the parasitic roundworm responsible for lymphatic filariasis, permanently disables over 36 million people and places 657 million at risk across 39 countries. A major bottleneck for drug discovery is the lack of functional annotation for more than 90 percent of the W. bancrofti dark proteome, leaving many potential targets unidentified. In this work, we present a novel computational pipeline that converts W. bancrofti's unannotated amino acid sequence data into precise four-level Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers and drug candidates. We utilized a DEtection TRansformer to estimate the probability of enzymatic function, fine-tuned a hierarchical nearest neighbor EC predictor on 4,476 labeled parasite proteins, and applied rejection sampling to retain only four-level EC classifications at 100 percent confidence. This pipeline assigned precise EC numbers to 14,772 previously uncharacterized proteins and discovered 543 EC classes not previously known in W. bancrofti. A qualitative triage emphasizing parasite-specific targets, chemical tractability, biochemical importance, and biological plausibility prioritized six enzymes across five separate strategies: anti-Wolbachia cell-wall inhibition, proteolysis blockade, transmission disruption, purinergic immune interference, and cGMP-signaling destabilization. We curated a 43-compound library from ChEMBL and BindingDB and co-folded across multiple protein conformers with Boltz-2. All six targets exhibited at least moderately strong predicted binding affinities below 1 micromolar, with moenomycin analogs against peptidoglycan glycosyltransferase and NTPase inhibitors showing promising nanomolar hits and well-defined binding pockets. While experimental validation remains essential, our results provide the first large-scale functional map of the W. bancrofti dark proteome and accelerate early-stage drug development for the species.",

        "summary": "Comprehensive visual, geometric, and semantic understanding of a 3D scene is crucial for successful execution of robotic tasks, especially in unstructured and complex environments. Additionally, to make robust decisions, it is necessary for the robot to evaluate the reliability of perceived information. While recent advances in 3D neural feature fields have enabled robots to leverage features from pretrained foundation models for tasks such as language-guided manipulation and navigation, existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: (i) they are typically scene-specific, and (ii) they lack the ability to model uncertainty in their predictions. We present UniFField, a unified uncertainty-aware neural feature field that combines visual, semantic, and geometric features in a single generalizable representation while also predicting uncertainty in each modality. Our approach, which can be applied zero shot to any new environment, incrementally integrates RGB-D images into our voxel-based feature representation as the robot explores the scene, simultaneously updating uncertainty estimation. We evaluate our uncertainty estimations to accurately describe the model prediction errors in scene reconstruction and semantic feature prediction. Furthermore, we successfully leverage our feature predictions and their respective uncertainty for an active object search task using a mobile manipulator robot, demonstrating the capability for robust decision-making.",
