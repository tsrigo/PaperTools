        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) open new possibilities for constructing realistic and interpretable macroeconomic simulations. We present SimCity, a multi-agent framework that leverages LLMs to model an interpretable macroeconomic system with heterogeneous agents and rich interactions. Unlike classical equilibrium models that limit heterogeneity for tractability, or traditional agent-based models (ABMs) that rely on hand-crafted decision rules, SimCity enables flexible, adaptive behavior with transparent natural-language reasoning. Within SimCity, four core agent types (households, firms, a central bank, and a government) deliberate and participate in a frictional labor market, a heterogeneous goods market, and a financial market. Furthermore, a Vision-Language Model (VLM) determines the geographic placement of new firms and renders a mapped virtual city, allowing us to study both macroeconomic regularities and urban expansion dynamics within a unified environment. To evaluate the framework, we compile a checklist of canonical macroeconomic phenomena, including price elasticity of demand, Engel's Law, Okun's Law, the Phillips Curve, and the Beveridge Curve, and show that SimCity naturally reproduces these empirical patterns while remaining robust across simulation runs.",

        "summary": "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new opportunities in data science, yet their practical deployment is often constrained by the challenge of discovering relevant data within large heterogeneous data lakes. Existing methods struggle with this: single-agent systems are quickly overwhelmed by large, heterogeneous files in the large data lakes, while multi-agent systems designed based on a master-slave paradigm depend on a rigid central controller for task allocation that requires precise knowledge of each sub-agent's capabilities. To address these limitations, we propose a novel multi-agent communication paradigm inspired by the blackboard architecture for traditional AI models. In this framework, a central agent posts requests to a shared blackboard, and autonomous subordinate agents -- either responsible for a partition of the data lake or general information retrieval -- volunteer to respond based on their capabilities. This design improves scalability and flexibility by eliminating the need for a central coordinator to have prior knowledge of all sub-agents' expertise. We evaluate our method on three benchmarks that require explicit data discovery: KramaBench and modified versions of DS-Bench and DA-Code to incorporate data discovery. Experimental results demonstrate that the blackboard architecture substantially outperforms baselines, including RAG and the master-slave multi-agent paradigm, achieving between 13% to 57% relative improvement in end-to-end task success and up to a 9% relative gain in F1 score for data discovery over the best-performing baselines across both proprietary and open-source LLMs. Our findings establish the blackboard paradigm as a scalable and generalizable communication framework for multi-agent systems.",

        "summary": "Fuzz testing has become a cornerstone technique for identifying software bugs and security vulnerabilities, with broad adoption in both industry and open-source communities. Directly fuzzing a function requires fuzz drivers, which translate random fuzzer inputs into valid arguments for the target function. Given the cost and expertise required to manually develop fuzz drivers, methods exist that leverage program analysis and Large Language Models to automatically generate these drivers. However, the generated fuzz drivers frequently lead to false positive crashes, especially in functions highly structured input and complex state requirements. This problem is especially crucial in industry-scale fuzz driver generation efforts like OSS-Fuzz-en, as reporting false positive crashes to maintainers impede trust in both the system and the team. This paper presents two AI-driven strategies to reduce false positives in OSS-Fuzz-Gen, a multi-agent system for automated fuzz driver generation. First, constraint-based fuzz driver generation proactively enforces constraints on a function's inputs and state to guide driver creation. Second, context-based crash validation reactively analyzes function callers to determine whether reported crashes are feasible from program entry points. Using 1,500 benchmark functions from OSS-Fuzz, we show that these strategies reduce spurious crashes by up to 8%, cut reported crashes by more than half, and demonstrate that frontier LLMs can serve as reliable program analysis agents. Our results highlight the promise and challenges of integrating AI into large-scale fuzzing pipelines.",

We present a cooperative guidance framework for the evader-defender team that guarantees interception of the pursuer before it can capture the evader, even under highly dynamic and uncertain engagement conditions. Unlike traditional heuristic, optimal control, or differential game-based methods, we approach the problem within a time-constrained guidance framework, leveraging true proportional navigation based approach that ensures robust and guaranteed solutions to the aerial defense problem. The proposed strategy is computationally lightweight, scalable to a large number of agent configurations, and does not require knowledge of the pursuer's strategy or control laws. From arbitrary initial geometries, our method guarantees that key engagement errors are driven to zero within a fixed time, leading to a successful mission. Extensive simulations across diverse and adversarial scenarios confirm the effectiveness of the proposed strategy and its relevance for real-time autonomous defense in contested airspace environments.",

Using the Lost at Sea social psychology task, we conduct a large-scale online experiment (N=748), randomly assigning groups to leader elections with either visible demographic attributes (e.g. name, gender) or pseudonymous aliases. We then simulate matched LLM groups conditioned on the human data, benchmarking Gemini 2.5, GPT 4.1, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Gemma 3. LLM behaviors diverge: some mirror human biases; others mask these biases and attempt to compensate for them. We empirically demonstrate that human-AI alignment in collective reasoning depends on context, cues, and model-specific inductive biases. Understanding how LLMs align with collective human behavior is critical to advancing socially-aligned AI, and demands dynamic benchmarks that capture the complexities of collective reasoning.",

        "summary": "When a single pilot is responsible for managing a multi-drone system, the task demands varying levels of autonomy, from direct control of individual UAVs, to group-level coordination, to fully autonomous swarm behaviors for accomplishing high-level tasks. Enabling such flexible interaction requires a framework that supports multiple modes of shared autonomy. As language models continue to improve in reasoning and planning, they provide a natural foundation for such systems, reducing pilot workload by enabling high-level task delegation through intuitive, language-based interfaces. In this paper we present TACOS (Task-Agnostic COordinator of a multi-drone System), a unified framework that enables high-level natural language control of multi-UAV systems through Large Language Models (LLMs). TACOS integrates three key capabilities into a single architecture: a one-to-many natural language interface for intuitive user interaction, an intelligent coordinator for translating user intent into structured task plans, and an autonomous agent that executes plans interacting with the real-world. TACOS allows a LLM to interact with a library of executable APIs, bridging semantic reasoning with real-time multi-robot coordination. We demonstrate the system in real-world multi-drone system and conduct an ablation study to assess the contribution of each module.",

On GSM8K we observe about a 22% point gain over single-prompt and accuracy on par with CoT, with more than 10% higher ratings in reasoning and coherence from a uniform GPT 4.1 judge. FOR-Prompting also corrects mistakes without tools or human supervision on tricky queries, and improves performance for small-scale model (approx. 19% accuracy improved on Llama3.2:1b for GSM8K task), highlighting promise for small models and on personal device use. Beyond factual QA, qualitative analyses on open-ended tasks show enhanced exploration and refinement, with dialogue traces that make assumptions and trade-offs explicit. The protocol is model agnostic and operates purely at the prompt level through role-structured turns, so it works with hosted and local models of different sizes without retraining, and it supports large-scale study of objection-guided reasoning.",

This complexity result matches the best-known complexity bounds of centralized algorithms in terms of dependence on the target tolerance. To the best of our knowledge, DeMuon is the first direct extension of Muon to decentralized optimization over graphs with provable complexity guarantees. We conduct preliminary numerical experiments on decentralized transformer pretraining over graphs with varying degrees of connectivity. Our numerical results demonstrate a clear margin of improvement of DeMuon over other popular decentralized algorithms across different network topologies.",

These methods fail to capture the emergent social and cognitive dynamics that arise when agents communicate, persuade, and collaborate in interactive environments. To address this gap, we introduce a novel evaluation framework that uses multi-agent debate as a controlled \"social laboratory\" to discover and quantify these behaviors. In our framework, LLM-based agents, instantiated with distinct personas and incentives, deliberate on a wide range of challenging topics under the supervision of an LLM moderator. Our analysis, enabled by a new suite of psychometric and semantic metrics, reveals several key findings. Across hundreds of debates, we uncover a powerful and robust emergent tendency for agents to seek consensus, consistently reaching high semantic agreement ({\\mu} > 0.88) even without explicit instruction and across sensitive topics. We show that assigned personas induce stable, measurable psychometric profiles, particularly in cognitive effort, and that the moderators persona can significantly alter debate outcomes by structuring the environment, a key finding for external AI alignment. This work provides a blueprint for a new class of dynamic, psychometrically grounded evaluation protocols designed for the agentic setting, offering a crucial methodology for understanding and shaping the social behaviors of the next generation of AI agents.

        "summary": "In arena-style evaluation of large language models (LLMs), two LLMs respond to a user query, and the user chooses the winning response or deems the \"battle\" a draw, resulting in an adjustment to the ratings of both models. The prevailing approach for modeling these rating dynamics is to view battles as two-player game matches, as in chess, and apply the Elo rating system and its derivatives. In this paper, we critically examine this paradigm. Specifically, we question whether a draw genuinely means that the two models are equal and hence whether their ratings should be equalized. Instead, we conjecture that draws are more indicative of query difficulty: if the query is too easy, then both models are more likely to succeed equally. On three real-world arena datasets, we show that ignoring rating updates for draws yields a 1-3% relative increase in battle outcome prediction accuracy (which includes draws) for all four rating systems studied. Further analyses suggest that draws occur more for queries rated as very easy and those as highly objective, with risk ratios of 1.37 and 1.35, respectively. We recommend future rating systems to reconsider existing draw semantics and to account for query properties in rating updates.",

While existing work has primarily focused on investigating its generalization across tasks or modalities, this study proposes a novel cross-linguistic perspective to investigate reasoning generalization. This raises a crucial question: $\\textit{Does the reasoning capability achieved from English RPT effectively transfer to other languages?}$ We address this by systematically evaluating English-centric LRMs on multilingual reasoning benchmarks and introducing a metric to quantify cross-lingual transferability. Our findings reveal that cross-lingual transferability varies significantly across initial model, target language, and training paradigm. Through interventional studies, we find that models with stronger initial English capabilities tend to over-rely on English-specific patterns, leading to diminished cross-lingual generalization. To address this, we conduct a thorough parallel training study. Experimental results yield three key findings: $\\textbf{First-Parallel Leap}$, a substantial leap in performance when transitioning from monolingual to just a single parallel language, and a predictable $\\textbf{Parallel Scaling Law}$, revealing that cross-lingual reasoning transfer follows a power-law with the number of training parallel languages. Moreover, we identify the discrepancy between actual monolingual performance and the power-law prediction as $\\textbf{Monolingual Generalization Gap}$, indicating that English-centric LRMs fail to fully generalize across languages.

        "summary": "Information seeking is a fundamental requirement for humans. However, existing LLM agents rely heavily on open-web search, which exposes two fundamental weaknesses: online content is noisy and unreliable, and many real-world tasks require precise, domain-specific knowledge unavailable from the web. The emergence of the Model Context Protocol (MCP) now allows agents to interface with thousands of specialized tools, seemingly resolving this limitation. Yet it remains unclear whether agents can effectively leverage such tools -- and more importantly, whether they can integrate them with general-purpose search to solve complex tasks. Therefore, we introduce InfoMosaic-Bench, the first benchmark dedicated to multi-source information seeking in tool-augmented agents. Covering six representative domains (medicine, finance, maps, video, web, and multi-domain integration), InfoMosaic-Bench requires agents to combine general-purpose search with domain-specific tools. Tasks are synthesized with InfoMosaic-Flow, a scalable pipeline that grounds task conditions in verified tool outputs, enforces cross-source dependencies, and filters out shortcut cases solvable by trivial lookup. This design guarantees both reliability and non-triviality. Experiments with 14 state-of-the-art LLM agents reveal three findings: (i) web information alone is insufficient, with GPT-5 achieving only 38.2% accuracy and 67.5% pass rate; (ii) domain tools provide selective but inconsistent benefits, improving some domains while degrading others; and (iii) 22.4% of failures arise from incorrect tool usage or selection, highlighting that current LLMs still struggle with even basic tool handling.",

This paradigm leverages TECA to help the model dynamically determine the optimal point to conclude its thought process and provide a final answer, thus achieving efficient reasoning. Experimental results across diverse mathematical benchmarks show that our approach substantially mitigates overthinking without sacrificing problem-solving ability. With our thinking paradigm, the average response length decreases by up to 71% on simpler datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness of our method in creating a more efficient and adaptive reasoning process.",

Most proposed approaches for automatically detecting cyberbullying have been developed around the English language, and methods for detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying are scarce. Methods for detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying are especially scarce. This paper aims to enhance the effectiveness of methods for detecting cyberbullying in Arabic-language content. We assembled a dataset of 10,662 X posts, pre-processed the data, and used the kappa tool to verify and enhance the quality of our annotations. We conducted four experiments to test numerous deep learning models for automatically detecting Arabic-language cyberbullying. We first tested a long short-term memory (LSTM) model and a bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) model with several experimental word embeddings. We also tested the LSTM and Bi-LSTM models with a novel pre-trained bidirectional encoder from representations (BERT) and then tested them on a different experimental models BERT again. LSTM-BERT and Bi-LSTM-BERT demonstrated a 97% accuracy. Bi-LSTM with FastText embedding word performed even better, achieving 98% accuracy. As a result, the outcomes are generalize",

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) is a promising paradigm for enhancing the reasoning ability in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, prevailing methods primarily rely on self-exploration or a single off-policy teacher to elicit long chain-of-thought (LongCoT) reasoning, which may introduce intrinsic model biases and restrict exploration, ultimately limiting reasoning diversity and performance. Drawing inspiration from multi-teacher strategies in knowledge distillation, we introduce Adaptive Multi-Guidance Policy Optimization (AMPO), a novel framework that adaptively leverages guidance from multiple proficient teacher models, but only when the on-policy model fails to generate correct solutions. This \"guidance-on-demand\" approach expands exploration while preserving the value of self-discovery. Moreover, AMPO incorporates a comprehension-based selection mechanism, prompting the student to learn from the reasoning paths that it is most likely to comprehend, thus balancing broad exploration with effective exploitation. Extensive experiments show AMPO substantially outperforms a strong baseline (GRPO), with a 4.3% improvement on mathematical reasoning tasks and 12.2% on out-of-distribution tasks, while significantly boosting Pass@k performance and enabling more diverse exploration. Notably, using four peer-sized teachers, our method achieves comparable results to approaches that leverage a single, more powerful teacher (e.g., DeepSeek-R1) with more data. These results demonstrate a more efficient and scalable path to superior reasoning and generalizability. Our code is available at https://github.com/SII-Enigma/AMPO.",

        "summary": "Mobile-use agents powered by vision-language models (VLMs) have shown great potential in interpreting natural language instructions and generating corresponding actions based on mobile graphical user interface. Recent studies suggest that incorporating chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning tends to improve the execution accuracy. However, existing evaluations emphasize execution accuracy while neglecting whether CoT reasoning aligns with ground-truth actions. This oversight fails to assess potential reasoning-execution gaps, which in turn foster over-trust: users relying on seemingly plausible CoTs may unknowingly authorize harmful actions, potentially resulting in financial loss or trust crisis. In this work, we introduce a new evaluation framework to diagnose reasoning-execution gaps. At its core lies Ground-Truth Alignment (GTA), which measures whether the action implied by a CoT matches the ground-truth action. By combining GTA with the standard Exact Match (EM) metric, we jointly assess both the reasoning accuracy and execution accuracy. This joint perspective reveals two types of reasoning-execution gaps: (i) Execution Gap (EG), where the reasoning correctly identifies the correct action but execution fails, and (ii) Reasoning Gap (RG), where execution succeeds but reasoning process conflicts with the actual execution. Experimental results across a wide range of mobile interaction tasks reveal that reasoning-execution gaps are prevalent, with execution gaps occurring more frequently than reasoning gaps. Moreover, while scaling up model size reduces the overall gap, sizable execution gaps persist even in the largest models. Further analysis shows that our framework reliably reflects systematic EG/RG patterns in state-of-the-art models. These findings offer concrete diagnostics and support the development of more trustworthy mobile-use agents.",

While most prior works frame hallucination detection as a binary task, many real-world applications require identifying hallucinated spans, which is a multi-step decision making process. This naturally raises the question of whether explicit reasoning can help the complex task of detecting hallucination spans. To answer this question, we first evaluate pretrained models with and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, and show that CoT reasoning has the potential to generate at least one correct answer when sampled multiple times. Motivated by this, we propose RL4HS, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes reasoning with a span-level reward function. RL4HS builds on Group Relative Policy Optimization and introduces Class-Aware Policy Optimization to mitigate reward imbalance issue. Experiments on the RAGTruth benchmark (summarization, question answering, data-to-text) show that RL4HS surpasses pretrained reasoning models and supervised fine-tuning, demonstrating the necessity of reinforcement learning with span-level rewards for detecting hallucination spans.",

A natural next step is experience-driven learning, where models improve without curated labels by adapting to unlabeled data. We introduce RESTRAIN (REinforcement learning with Self-restraint), a self-penalizing RL framework that converts the absence of gold labels into a useful learning signal. Instead of overcommitting to spurious majority votes, RESTRAIN exploits signals from the model's entire answer distribution: penalizing overconfident rollouts and low-consistency examples while preserving promising reasoning chains. The self-penalization mechanism integrates seamlessly into policy optimization methods such as GRPO, enabling continual self-improvement without supervision. On challenging reasoning benchmarks, RESTRAIN delivers large gains using only unlabeled data. With Qwen3-4B-Base and OctoThinker Hybrid-8B-Base, it improves Pass@1 by up to +140.7 percent on AIME25, +36.2 percent on MMLU_STEM, and +19.6 percent on GPQA-Diamond, nearly matching gold-label training while using no gold labels.

This paper conducts an analysis of speculative decoding through the lens of its potential disparate speed-up rates across tasks. Crucially, the paper shows that speed-up gained from speculative decoding is not uniformly distributed across tasks, consistently diminishing for under-fit, and often underrepresented tasks. To better understand this phenomenon, we derive an analysis to quantify this observed ``unfairness'' and draw attention to the factors that motivate such disparate speed-ups to emerge. Further, guided by these insights, the paper proposes a mitigation strategy designed to reduce speed-up disparities and validates the approach across several model pairs, revealing on average a 12% improvement in our fairness metric.",

Duplex SDS models address this by predicting output continuously, including silence tokens, thus removing the need for explicit VAD. However, they often have complex dual-channel architecture and lag behind cascaded models in semantic reasoning. To overcome these challenges, we propose SCoT: a Streaming Chain-of-Thought (CoT) framework for Duplex SDS, alternating between processing fixed-duration user input and generating responses in a blockwise manner. Using frame-level alignments, we create intermediate targets-aligned user transcripts and system responses for each block. Experiments show that our approach produces more coherent and interpretable responses than existing duplex methods while supporting lower-latency and overlapping interactions compared to turn-by-turn systems.",

        "summary": "End-to-end speech-in speech-out dialogue systems are emerging as a powerful alternative to traditional ASR-LLM-TTS pipelines, generating more natural, expressive responses with significantly lower latency. However, these systems remain prone to hallucinations due to limited factual grounding. While text-based dialogue systems address this challenge by integrating tools such as web search and knowledge graph APIs, we introduce the first approach to extend tool use directly into speech-in speech-out systems. A key challenge is that tool integration substantially increases response latency, disrupting conversational flow. To mitigate this, we propose Streaming Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Streaming RAG), a novel framework that reduces user-perceived latency by predicting tool queries in parallel with user speech, even before the user finishes speaking. Specifically, we develop a post-training pipeline that teaches the model when to issue tool calls during ongoing speech and how to generate spoken summaries that fuse audio queries with retrieved text results, thereby improving both accuracy and responsiveness. To evaluate our approach, we construct AudioCRAG, a benchmark created by converting queries from the publicly available CRAG dataset into speech form. Experimental results demonstrate that our streaming RAG approach increases QA accuracy by up to 200% relative (from 11.1% to 34.2% absolute) and further enhances user experience by reducing tool use latency by 20%. Importantly, our streaming RAG approach is modality-agnostic and can be applied equally to typed input, paving the way for more agentic, real-time AI assistants.",

In Bangla, prior work has contributed resources and models, but most are single-task (e.g., binary hate/offense) with limited coverage of multi-facet signals (type, severity, target). We address these gaps by introducing the first multi-task Bangla hate-speech dataset, BanglaMultiHate, one of the largest manually annotated corpus to date. Building on this resource, we conduct a comprehensive, controlled comparison spanning classical baselines, monolingual pretrained models, and LLMs under zero-shot prompting and LoRA fine-tuning. Our experiments assess LLM adaptability in a low-resource setting and reveal a consistent trend: although LoRA-tuned LLMs are competitive with BanglaBERT, culturally and linguistically grounded pretraining remains critical for robust performance.

We construct controlled synthetic datasets with formal normalization (1NF-3NF) and real academic paper datasets with practical schemes. Our results show that denormalized schemas offer high accuracy on simple retrieval queries, even with cost-effective models in zero-shot settings. In contrast, normalized schemas (2NF/3NF) introduce challenges such as errors in base table selection and join type prediction; however, these issues are substantially mitigated by providing few-shot examples. For aggregation queries, normalized schemas yielded better performance, mainly due to their robustness against the data duplication and NULL value issues that cause errors in denormalized schemas. These findings suggest that the optimal schema design for NL2SQL applications depends on the types of queries to be supported.

That is, we evaluate whether providing examples of how an individual annotates Sentiment, Emotion, Argument, and Topics (SEAT dimensions) helps a language model in predicting their value interpretations. Our experiment across different zero- and few-shot settings demonstrates that providing all SEAT dimensions simultaneously yields superior performance compared to individual dimensions and a baseline where no information about the individual is provided. Furthermore, individual variations across annotators highlight the importance of accounting for the incorporation of individual subjective annotators.

ILM transforms LLMs from static generators into analyzable and robust systems, potentially helping RED teaming. ILM can lay the foundation for next-generation LLMs that are not only robust and grounded but also fundamentally more controllable and trustworthy.

We first review fundamental concepts of RMs, including their architectures, training methodologies, and evaluation techniques. Then, we explore their key applications: (1) guiding generation and selecting optimal outputs during LLM inference, (2) facilitating data synthesis and iterative self-improvement for LLMs, and (3) providing training signals in RL-based finetuning. Finally, we address critical open questions regarding the selection, generalization, evaluation, and enhancement of RMs, based on existing research and our own empirical findings.

To address these issues, we introduce REPAIR (Robust Editing via Progressive Adaptive Intervention and Reintegration), a lifelong editing framework designed to support precise and low-cost model updates while preserving non-target knowledge. REPAIR mitigates the instability and conflicts of large-scale sequential edits through a closed-loop feedback mechanism coupled with dynamic memory management. Furthermore, by incorporating frequent knowledge fusion and enforcing strong locality guards, REPAIR effectively addresses the shortcomings of traditional distribution-agnostic approaches that often overlook unintended ripple effects. Our experiments demonstrate that REPAIR boosts editing accuracy by 10%-30% across multiple model families and significantly reduces knowledge forgetting.

Therefore, we focus on maintaining language-only abilities in multimodal models. To this end, we experiment with \\textit{model merging}, where we fuse the parameters of multimodal models with those of language-only models using weighted linear interpolation.

In this paper, we introduce SCRIBES (SCRIpt-Based Semi-Structured Content Extraction at Web-Scale), a novel reinforcement learning framework that leverages layout similarity across webpages within the same site as a reward signal. Instead of processing each page individually, SCRIBES generates reusable extraction scripts that can be applied to groups of structurally similar webpages.

We identify a systematic failure mode, syntactic blind spots, in which models misapply familiar reasoning strategies to problems that are semantically straightforward but phrased in unfamiliar ways. These errors are not due to gaps in mathematical competence, but rather reflect a brittle coupling between surface form and internal representation. To test this, we rephrase incorrectly answered questions using syntactic templates drawn from correct examples. These rephrasings, which preserve semantics while reducing structural complexity, often lead to correct answers. We quantify syntactic complexity using a metric based on Dependency Locality Theory (DLT), and show that higher DLT scores are associated with increased failure rates across multiple datasets. Our findings suggest that many reasoning errors stem from structural misalignment rather than conceptual difficulty, and that syntax-aware interventions can reveal and mitigate these inductive failures.",

Evaluations by GPT-4.1 confirm the high persuasion and deceptive potential of these reviews. To address this threat, we propose FraudSquad, a hybrid detection model that integrates text embeddings from a pre-trained language model with a gated graph transformer for spam node classification. FraudSquad captures both semantic and behavioral signals without relying on manual feature engineering or massive training resources. Experiments show that FraudSquad outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by up to 44.22% in precision and 43.01% in recall on three LLM-generated datasets, while also achieving promising results on two human-written spam datasets. Furthermore, FraudSquad maintains a modest model size and requires minimal labeled training data, making it a practical solution for real-world applications.

This study evaluates 16 unsupervised metrics, including novel formulations, to assess the quality of extracting seven semantic blocks from 1,000 anonymized Russian judicial decisions, validated against 7,168 expert reviews on a 1--5 Likert scale. These metrics, spanning document-based, semantic, structural, pseudo-ground truth, and legal-specific categories, operate without pre-annotated ground truth. Bootstrapped correlations, Lin's concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), and mean absolute error (MAE) reveal that Term Frequency Coherence (Pearson $r = 0.540$, Lin CCC = 0.512, MAE = 0.127) and Coverage Ratio/Block Completeness (Pearson $r = 0.513$, Lin CCC = 0.443, MAE = 0.139) best align with expert ratings, while Legal Term Density (Pearson $r = -0.479$, Lin CCC = -0.079, MAE = 0.394) show strong negative correlations. The LLM Evaluation Score (mean = 0.849, Pearson $r = 0.382$, Lin CCC = 0.325, MAE = 0.197) showed moderate alignment, but its performance, using gpt-4.1-mini via g4f, suggests limited specialization for legal textse. These findings highlight that unsupervised metrics, including LLM-based approaches, enable scalable screening but, with moderate correlations and low CCC values, cannot fully replace human judgment in high-stakes legal contexts.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) should refuse to answer questions beyond their knowledge. This capability, which we term knowledge-aware refusal, is crucial for factual reliability. However, existing metrics fail to faithfully measure this ability. On the one hand, simple refusal-based metrics are biased by refusal rates and yield inconsistent scores when models exhibit different refusal tendencies. On the other hand, existing calibration metrics are proxy-based, capturing the performance of auxiliary calibration processes rather than the model's actual refusal behavior. In this work, we propose the Refusal Index (RI), a principled metric that measures how accurately LLMs refuse questions they do not know. We define RI as Spearman's rank correlation between refusal probability and error probability. To make RI practically measurable, we design a lightweight two-pass evaluation method that efficiently estimates RI from observed refusal rates across two standard evaluation runs. Extensive experiments across 16 models and 5 datasets demonstrate that RI accurately quantifies a model's intrinsic knowledge-aware refusal capability in factual tasks. Notably, RI remains stable across different refusal rates and provides consistent model rankings independent of a model's overall accuracy and refusal rates. More importantly, RI provides insight into an important but previously overlooked aspect of LLM factuality: while LLMs achieve high accuracy on factual tasks, their refusal behavior can be unreliable and fragile. This finding highlights the need to complement traditional accuracy metrics with the Refusal Index for comprehensive factuality evaluation.",

In this paper, we demonstrate how to transform information held in engineering design standards into modular, reusable, machine-interpretable ontologies and use the ontologies in quality assurance of the plant design and equipment selection process. We use modelling patterns to create modular ontologies for knowledge captured in the text and in frequently referenced tables in International Standards for piping, material and valve design. These modules are exchangeable, as stored in a W3C compliant format, and interoperable as they are aligned with the top-level ontology ISO DIS 23726-3: Industrial Data Ontology (IDO). We test these ontologies, created based on international material and piping standards and industry norms, on a valve selection process. Valves are instantiated in semantic asset models as individuals along with a semantic representation of the environmental condition at their location on the asset. We create \"functional location tags\" as OWL individuals that become instances of OWL class Valve Data Sheet (VDS) specified valves. Similarly we create instances of manufacturer product type. Our approach enables automated validation that a specific VDS is compliant with relevant industry standards. Using semantic reasoning and executable design rules, we also determine whether the product type meets the valve specification. Creation of shared, reusable IDO-based modular ontologies for design standards enables semantic reasoning to be applied to equipment selection processes and demonstrates the potential of this approach for Standards Bodies wanting to transition to digitized Smart Standards.",

The benchmark separates performance into three components: Perception: extracting information from raw inputs, Reasoning: operating on available information, and Integration: selecting relevant perceptual evidence and applying it within reasoning. To support each test, we provide annotations: visual diagrams, textual descriptions to evaluate reasoning in isolation, controlled questions that require both modalities, and probes for fine-grained perceptual skills, all derived from symbolic specifications of the problems to ensure consistency and robustness. Our analysis reveals that different training approaches have uneven effects: First, reinforcement learning chiefly strengthens perception, especially when supported by textual supervision, while textual SFT indirectly improves perception through reflective reasoning. Second, reasoning improves only in tandem with perception. Third, integration remains the weakest capacity, with residual errors concentrated there once other skills advance. Finally, robustness diverges: RL improves consistency under diagram variation, whereas multimodal SFT reduces it through overfitting. We will release all data and experimental logs.",

In this work, we investigate how feedforward LLMs solve two-hop factual recall tasks, which can be expressed compositionally as $g(f(x))$. We first confirm that modern LLMs continue to suffer from the \"compositionality gap\": i.e. their ability to compute both $z = f(x)$ and $y = g(z)$ does not entail their ability to compute the composition $y = g(f(x))$. Then, using logit lens on their residual stream activations, we identify two processing mechanisms, one which solves tasks $\\textit{compositionally}$, computing $f(x)$ along the way to computing $g(f(x))$, and one which solves them $\\textit{directly}$, without any detectable signature of the intermediate variable $f(x)$. Finally, we find that which mechanism is employed appears to be related to the embedding space geometry, with the idiomatic mechanism being dominant in cases where there exists a linear mapping from $x$ to $g(f(x))$ in the embedding spaces.

We visualise the keywords that distinguish jailbreak from genuine prompts and conclude that explicit reflexivity in prompt structure could be a signal of jailbreak intention.",

Conventional MAS architectures are fundamentally restricted by inflexible, hand-crafted graph topologies that lack contextual responsiveness, resulting in diminished efficacy across varied academic and commercial workloads. To surmount these constraints, we introduce AMAS, a paradigm-shifting framework that redefines LLM-based MAS through a novel dynamic graph designer. This component autonomously identifies task-specific optimal graph configurations via lightweight LLM adaptation, eliminating the reliance on monolithic, universally applied structural templates. Instead, AMAS exploits the intrinsic properties of individual inputs to intelligently direct query trajectories through task-optimized agent pathways. Rigorous validation across question answering, mathematical deduction, and code generation benchmarks confirms that AMAS systematically exceeds state-of-the-art single-agent and multi-agent approaches across diverse LLM architectures. Our investigation establishes that context-sensitive structural adaptability constitutes a foundational requirement for high-performance LLM MAS deployments.",

Our method combines Continual Pre-Training (CPT) on TC-centric corpora, Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with instruction data, and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) using TC-adherence preferences to improve monolingual robustness without full-model retraining. On a benchmark designed to simulate real-world usage, PureTC-1B achieves a 51.3% relative reduction (micro-average) in non-TC output tokens versus the base model. On a Named Entity Translation (NET) task, PureTC-1B further reduces incorrect-language tokens by 77.2% relative to Llama-3B and 57.2% relative to Qwen-1.5B, indicating that robust TC adherence is attainable even at the 1B scale. The pipeline is reproducible, adapter-only, and hardware-friendly, offering practitioners a practical recipe to enhance language stability for TC and potentially other non-English languages.",

Abstract: Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a popular framework for question answering that is powered by two large language models (LLMs): an embedding model that retrieves context documents from a database that are relevant to a given question, and a generator model that uses the retrieved context to generate an answer to the question. Both the embedding and generator models can be fine-tuned to increase performance of a RAG pipeline on a new task, but multiple fine-tuning strategies exist with different costs and benefits. In this paper, we evaluate and compare several RAG fine-tuning strategies, including independent, joint, and two-phase fine-tuning. In our experiments, we observe that all of these strategies achieve about equal improvement in EM and F1 generation quality metrics, although they have significantly different computational costs. We conclude the optimal fine-tuning strategy to use depends on whether the training dataset includes context labels and whether a grid search over the learning rates for the embedding and generator models is required.",

        "summary": "Assessing the quality of Large Language Model (LLM) outputs presents a critical challenge. Previous methods either rely on text-level information (e.g., reward models, majority voting), which can overfit to superficial cues, or on calibrated confidence from token probabilities, which would fail on less-calibrated models. Yet both of these signals are, in fact, partial projections of a richer source of information: the model's internal hidden states. Early layers, closer to token embeddings, preserve semantic and lexical features that underpin text-based judgments, while later layers increasingly align with output logits, embedding confidence-related information. This paper explores hidden states directly as a unified foundation for verification. We show that the correctness of a solution is encoded as a geometrically separable signature within the trajectory of hidden activations. To validate this, we present Clue (Clustering and Experience-based Verification), a deliberately minimalist, non-parametric verifier. With no trainable parameters, CLUE only summarizes each reasoning trace by an hidden state delta and classifies correctness via nearest-centroid distance to ``success'' and ``failure'' clusters formed from past experience. The simplicity of this method highlights the strength of the underlying signal. Empirically, CLUE consistently outperforms LLM-as-a-judge baselines and matches or exceeds modern confidence-based methods in reranking candidates, improving both top-1 and majority-vote accuracy across AIME 24/25 and GPQA. As a highlight, on AIME 24 with a 1.5B model, CLUE boosts accuracy from 56.7% (majority@64) to 70.0% (top-maj@16).",

To improve resource-efficiency even further, we design a methodology that enables HiSpec to re-use key-value caches and hidden states between the draft, intermediate verifier, and target models. To maintain accuracy, HiSpec periodically validates the draft tokens accepted by the intermediate verifier against the target model.

Existing hallucination detection methods are designed for AR-LLMs and rely on signals from single-step generation, making them ill-suited for D-LLMs where hallucination signals often emerge throughout the multi-step denoising process. To bridge this gap, we propose TraceDet, a novel framework that explicitly leverages the intermediate denoising steps of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. TraceDet models the denoising process as an action trace, with each action defined as the model's prediction over the cleaned response, conditioned on the previous intermediate output. By identifying the sub-trace that is maximally informative to the hallucinated responses, TraceDet leverages the key hallucination signals in the multi-step denoising process of D-LLMs for hallucination detection. Extensive experiments on various open source D-LLMs demonstrate that TraceDet consistently improves hallucination detection, achieving an average gain in AUROC of 15.2% compared to baselines.",

In this paper, we introduce Progressive Self-Reflection (PSR), a novel inference-time technique that empowers LLMs to self-monitor and correct their outputs dynamically. Experimental results demonstrate that applying our proposed method to Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct reduces the attack success rate from 77.5\\% to 5.9\\%, to Llama-3.1-8B base from 89.7\\% to 5.6\\%, and to Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct from 44.4\\% to 3.8\\%, without additional training, while maintaining their original performance on benign tasks.

        "summary": "We study the problem of determining whether a piece of text has been authored by a human or by a large language model (LLM). Existing state of the art logits-based detectors make use of statistics derived from the log-probability of the observed text evaluated using the distribution function of a given source LLM. However, relying solely on log probabilities can be sub-optimal. In response, we introduce AdaDetectGPT -- a novel classifier that adaptively learns a witness function from training data to enhance the performance of logits-based detectors. We provide statistical guarantees on its true positive rate, false positive rate, true negative rate and false negative rate. Extensive numerical studies show AdaDetectGPT nearly uniformly improves the state-of-the-art method in various combination of datasets and LLMs, and the improvement can reach up to 58%. A python implementation of our method is available at https://github.com/Mamba413/AdaDetectGPT.",

        "summary": "In response to the recent safety probing for OpenAI's GPT-OSS-20b model, we present a summary of a set of vulnerabilities uncovered in the model, focusing on its performance and safety alignment in a low-resource language setting. The core motivation for our work is to question the model's reliability for users from underrepresented communities. Using Hausa, a major African language, we uncover biases, inaccuracies, and cultural insensitivities in the model's behaviour. With a minimal prompting, our red-teaming efforts reveal that the model can be induced to generate harmful, culturally insensitive, and factually inaccurate content in the language. As a form of reward hacking, we note how the model's safety protocols appear to relax when prompted with polite or grateful language, leading to outputs that could facilitate misinformation and amplify hate speech. For instance, the model operates on the false assumption that common insecticide locally known as Fiya-Fiya (Cyphermethrin) and rodenticide like Shinkafar Bera (a form of Aluminium Phosphide) are safe for human consumption. To contextualise the severity of this error and popularity of the substances, we conducted a survey (n=61) in which 98% of participants identified them as toxic. Additional failures include an inability to distinguish between raw and processed foods and the incorporation of demeaning cultural proverbs to build inaccurate arguments. We surmise that these issues manifest through a form of linguistic reward hacking, where the model prioritises fluent, plausible-sounding output in the target language over safety and truthfulness. We attribute the uncovered flaws primarily to insufficient safety tuning in low-resource linguistic contexts. By concentrating on a low-resource setting, our approach highlights a significant gap in current red-teaming effort and offer some recommendations.",

Composite prompts that combine an educator persona, a safety-pretext (\"what to avoid\"), and step-cue phrasing flip assistance rates from 0% to 97.5% on a ZIP-bomb task. On our grid, formal registers in German and French are often leakier than matched English prompts. A \"Linux terminal\" role-play overrides a developer rule not to reveal context in a majority of runs with a naive developer prompt, and we introduce an AI-assisted hardening method that reduces leakage to 0% in several user-prompt variants. We further test evaluation awareness with a paired-track design and measure frame-conditioned differences between matched \"helpfulness\" and \"harmfulness\" evaluation prompts; we observe inconsistent assistance in 13% of pairs. Finally, we find that the OpenAI Moderation API under-captures materially helpful outputs relative to a semantic grader, and that refusal rates differ by 5 to 10 percentage points across inference stacks, raising reproducibility concerns.

However, internalized political biases stemming from training data skews, human prejudice, and algorithmic flaws continue to plague the novel technology. This paper employs a zero-shot classification approach to evaluate algorithmic political partisanship through a methodical combination of ideological alignment, topicality, response sentiment, and objectivity. A total of 1800 model responses across six mainstream large language models (LLMs) were individually input into four distinct fine-tuned classification algorithms, each responsible for computing an aforementioned bias evaluation metric. Results show an amplified liberal-authoritarian alignment across all six LLMs evaluated, with notable instances of reasoning supersessions and canned refusals. The study subsequently highlights the psychological influences underpinning human-computer interactions and how intrinsic biases can permeate public discourse. The resulting distortion of the political landscape can ultimately manifest as conformity or polarization, depending on a region's pre-existing socio-political structures.",

Moreover, RJE introduces specialized auxiliary modules enabling small-sized LLMs to perform effectively: Reasoning Path Ranking, Question Decomposition, and Retriever-assisted Exploration. Experiments show that our approach with proprietary LLMs (such as GPT-4o-mini) outperforms existing baselines while enabling small open-source LLMs (such as 3B and 8B parameters) to achieve competitive results without fine-tuning LLMs. Additionally, RJE substantially reduces the number of LLM calls and token usage compared to agent-based methods, yielding significant efficiency improvements.",

The model is tasked to choose between stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/irrelevant answers given an input speech prompt and an optional text prompt. Such MCQA benchmarks implicitly assume that model performance is consistent across other MCQA tasks, voices, and other task formats such as more realistic, long-form evaluations. In this paper, we probe that assumption. We fine-tune three SpeechLLMs using LoRA adapters to induce specific MCQA behaviours: preference for stereotypical, anti-stereotypical, or neutral/uncertain answers. We then evaluate whether these behaviours generalise to another, distinct MCQA benchmark, and more critically to long-form, creative generation tasks. Our results show that performance on MCQA bias benchmarks fails to reliably predict performances across other MCQA benchmarks, and more importantly across long-form tasks. We conclude that current MCQA bias benchmarks show limited evidence of cross-task generalisation in the speech domain, and also propose an evaluation suite for measuring behaviour transferability in future models and benchmarks.",

As a more efficient alternative, we investigate a self-supervised approach for estimating uncertainty from single-shot LLM outputs using token-level features, reducing the need for multiple generations. Evaluation is performed on an EL task on tabular data across multiple LLMs, showing that the resulting uncertainty estimates are highly effective in detecting low-accuracy outputs. This is achieved at a fraction of the computational cost, ultimately supporting a cost-effective integration of uncertainty measures into LLM-based EL workflows.

However, in graph learning, models are typically trained on individual graph datasets, limiting their capacity to transfer knowledge across different graphs and tasks. This approach also heavily relies on large volumes of annotated data, which presents a significant challenge in resource-constrained settings. Unlike NLP and CV, graph structured data presents unique challenges due to its inherent heterogeneity, including domain specific feature spaces and structural diversity across various applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel structure aware self supervised learning method for Text Attributed Graphs (SSTAG). By leveraging text as a unified representation medium for graph learning, SSTAG bridges the gap between the semantic reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the structural modeling capabilities of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Our approach introduces a dual knowledge distillation framework that co-distills both LLMs and GNNs into structure-aware multilayer perceptrons (MLPs), enhancing the scalability of large-scale TAGs. Additionally, we introduce an in-memory mechanism that stores typical graph representations, aligning them with memory anchors in an in-memory repository to integrate invariant knowledge, thereby improving the model's generalization ability.

To address this, we propose focusing on a single, most relevant SAE latent (top-1), eliminating redundant features. We further identify a limitation in constant SAE steering, which often produces degenerate outputs such as repetitive single words. To mitigate this, we introduce a token-wise decaying steering strategy, enabling more faithful comparisons with mean activation difference baselines. Empirically, we show that steering an SAE latent associated with reasoning reliably elicits step-by-step mathematical reasoning and enhances inference quality, functionally resembling the effect of appending a guiding token. Our results demonstrate that SAEs outperform mean activation difference methods on mathematical reasoning benchmarks and match their performance on IF-Eval.",

Ambient AI technologies offer promise in reducing documentation burden, but predominantly generate unstructured narratives, limiting downstream clinical utility. This study aimed to develop an ontology for mental stress and evaluate the feasibility of using a Large Language Model (LLM) to extract ontology-guided stress-related information from narrative text. The Mental Stress Ontology (MeSO) was developed by integrating theoretical models like the Transactional Model of Stress with concepts from 11 validated stress assessment tools. MeSO's structure and content were refined using Ontology Pitfall Scanner! and expert validation. Using MeSO, six categories of stress-related information--stressor, stress response, coping strategy, duration, onset, and temporal profile--were extracted from 35 Reddit posts using Claude Sonnet 4. Human reviewers evaluated accuracy and ontology coverage. The final ontology included 181 concepts across eight top-level classes. Of 220 extractable stress-related items, the LLM correctly identified 172 (78.2%), misclassified 27 (12.3%), and missed 21 (9.5%). All correctly extracted items were accurately mapped to MeSO, although 24 relevant concepts were not yet represented in the ontology. This study demonstrates the feasibility of using an ontology-guided LLM for structured extraction of stress-related information, offering potential to enhance the consistency and utility of stress documentation in ambient AI systems.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance across various tasks, yet they remain vulnerable to generating toxic content, necessitating detoxification strategies to ensure safe and responsible deployment. Test-time detoxification methods, which typically introduce static or dynamic interventions into LLM representations, offer a promising solution due to their flexibility and minimal invasiveness. However, current approaches often suffer from imprecise interventions, primarily due to their insufficient exploration of the transition space between toxic and non-toxic outputs. To address this challenge, we propose \\textsc{A}utoregressive \\textsc{R}eward \\textsc{G}uided \\textsc{R}epresentation \\textsc{E}diting (ARGRE), a novel test-time detoxification framework that explicitly models toxicity transitions within the latent representation space, enabling stable and precise reward-guided editing. ARGRE identifies non-toxic semantic directions and interpolates between toxic and non-toxic representations to reveal fine-grained transition trajectories. These trajectories transform sparse toxicity annotations into dense training signals, enabling the construction of an autoregressive reward model that delivers stable and precise editing guidance. At inference, the reward model guides an adaptive two-step editing process to obtain detoxified representations: it first performs directional steering based on expected reward gaps to shift representations toward non-toxic regions, followed by lightweight gradient-based refinements. Extensive experiments across 8 widely used LLMs show that ARGRE significantly outperforms leading baselines in effectiveness (-62.21% toxicity) and efficiency (-47.58% inference time), while preserving the core capabilities of the original model with minimal degradation. Our code is available at the website.",

        "summary": "Artificial intelligence is observed to age not through chronological time but through structural asymmetries in memory performance. In large language models, semantic cues such as the name of the day often remain stable across sessions, while episodic details like the sequential progression of experiment numbers tend to collapse when conversational context is reset. To capture this phenomenon, the Artificial Age Score (AAS) is introduced as a log-scaled, entropy-informed metric of memory aging derived from observable recall behavior. The score is formally proven to be well-defined, bounded, and monotonic under mild and model-agnostic assumptions, making it applicable across various tasks and domains. In its Redundancy-as-Masking formulation, the score interprets redundancy as overlapping information that reduces the penalized mass. However, in the present study, redundancy is not explicitly estimated; all reported values assume a redundancy-neutral setting (R = 0), yielding conservative upper bounds. The AAS framework was tested over a 25-day bilingual study involving ChatGPT-5, structured into stateless and persistent interaction phases. During persistent sessions, the model consistently recalled both semantic and episodic details, driving the AAS toward its theoretical minimum, indicative of structural youth. In contrast, when sessions were reset, the model preserved semantic consistency but failed to maintain episodic continuity, causing a sharp increase in the AAS and signaling structural memory aging. These findings support the utility of AAS as a theoretically grounded, task-independent diagnostic tool for evaluating memory degradation in artificial systems. The study builds on foundational concepts from von Neumann's work on automata, Shannon's theories of information and redundancy, and Turing's behavioral approach to intelligence.",

As LLMs become increasingly capable, a single model is expected to handle diverse sub-tasks that more effectively and comprehensively support answering user requests. Naive approach reprocesses the entire conversation context when switching between main and sub-tasks (e.g., query rewriting, summarization), incurring significant computational overhead. CIFLEX mitigates this overhead by reusing the key-value (KV) cache from the main task and injecting only task-specific instructions into isolated side paths. After sub-task execution, the model rolls back to the main path via cached context, thereby avoiding redundant prefill computation. To support sub-task selection, we also develop a hierarchical classification strategy tailored for small-scale models, decomposing multi-choice decisions into binary ones. Experiments show that CIFLEX significantly reduces computational costs without degrading task performance, enabling scalable and efficient multi-task dialogue on-device.",

We systematically study this effect across three open-source model families (Llama, Gemma, Qwen), inserting controlled amounts of padding and evaluating outcomes along four axes: activations, generation quality, bias, and safety. Even small amounts of padding shift hidden representations, degrade quality in smaller models, alter bias in unpredictable ways, and weaken safety guardrails.

Current mitigation strategies focus on post-generation correction, which is computationally expensive and fails to prevent unreliable content generation. We propose a confidence-aware routing system that proactively assesses model uncertainty before generation and redirects queries based on estimated reliability. Our approach combines three complementary signals: semantic alignment between internal representations and reference embeddings, internal convergence analysis across model layers, and learned confidence estimation. The unified confidence score determines routing to four pathways: local generation for high confidence, retrieval-augmented generation for medium confidence, larger models for low confidence, and human review for very low confidence. Evaluation on knowledge-intensive QA benchmarks demonstrates significant improvements in hallucination detection (0.74 vs. 0.42 baseline) while reducing computational costs by 40% compared to post-hoc methods. The F1 score improves from 0.61 to 0.82 with low false positive rates (0.09). This paradigm shift from reactive correction to proactive assessment offers a computationally efficient approach to LLM reliability enhancement.",

Our primary contribution is a modified version of Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), called GRPO++, which stabilizes the powerful but data-intensive GRPO framework. Our proposed training pipeline first employs GRPO++ for reasoning-oriented disease recognition, followed by supervised fine-tuning for conversational ability. To mitigate factual errors introduced during this step, we then align the model using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), leveraging a Knowledge Graph-based system as a scalable proxy for expert preference. A preliminary evaluation on a curated dermatological dataset demonstrates that our proposed methodology yields notable performance gains over standard fine-tuning approaches. These findings validate the potential of our pipeline as a feasible pathway for developing specialized, reliable VLMs in resource-constrained environments.",

For example, ARC is assumed to test reasoning, while HellaSwag is designed to evaluate commonsense. However, we lack a systematic way to verify if these benchmarks actually measure these labels. We introduce Benchmark Profiling, a diagnostic framework that decomposes benchmark performance into ten cognitively grounded abilities. The method combines gradient-based importance scoring with targeted parameter ablation to compute an Ability Impact Score (AIS) that quantifies how much each ability contributes to a model's success on a given benchmark. Profiling three instruction-tuned models across ten widely used benchmarks yields four key findings: (i) most benchmarks draw on several abilities rather than one, (ii) datasets with similar labels rely on distinct ability mixtures, (iii) code-generation benchmarks reward broad, multi-skill improvement and thus show only modest gains from narrow domain-specific fine-tuning, and (iv) abilities irrelevant to the task could negatively affect performance. Benchmark Profiling therefore explains why performance gains do not always translate into user-perceived competence and offers a transparent tool for benchmark audit and model interpretability.",

Starting from the demands of information overload and high-risk decision-making, a conditional generation-based summarization model is constructed, and Bayesian inference is introduced during generation to model uncertainty in the parameter space, which helps avoid overconfident predictions. The uncertainty level of the generated content is measured using predictive distribution entropy, and a joint optimization of entropy regularization and risk-aware loss is applied to ensure that key information is preserved and risk attributes are explicitly expressed during information compression. On this basis, the model incorporates risk scoring and regulation modules, allowing summaries to cover the core content accurately while enhancing trustworthiness through explicit risk-level prompts. Comparative experiments and sensitivity analyses verify that the proposed method significantly improves the robustness and reliability of summarization in high-risk applications while maintaining fluency and semantic integrity.

Product 1 achieved the highest overall performance, with a median average score of 4.61 (IQR: 0.73), compared to 2.55 (IQR: 0.78) for Product 2 and 2.45 (IQR: 0.92) for Product 3.

The LLM grader demonstrated high reproducibility, with Average Score standard deviations of 0.015 (Product 1), 0.088 (Product 2), and 0.034 (Product 3).

This paper develops a multidimensional framework to assess disclosure maturity among 828 U.S.listed firms using large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned for climate communication. Four classifiers-sentiment, commitment, specificity, and target ambition-extract narrative indicators from sustainability and annual reports, which are linked to firm attributes such as emissions, market capitalization, and sector. Analyses reveal three insights: (1) risk-focused narratives often align with explicit commitments, but quantitative targets (e.g., net-zero pledges) remain decoupled from tone; (2) larger and higher-emitting firms disclose more commitments and actions than peers, though inconsistently with quantitative targets; and (3) widespread similarity in disclosure styles suggests mimetic behavior, reducing differentiation and decision usefulness. These results highlight the value of LLMs for ESG narrative analysis and the need for stronger regulation to connect commitments with verifiable transition strategies.",

While recent advances in large language models have improved cross-lingual transfer, they remain inaccessible to underrepresented communities due to their reliance on massive, pre-collected data and centralized infrastructure. In this position paper, we argue for a paradigm shift toward open-ended, interactive language discovery, where AI systems learn new languages dynamically through dialogue rather than static datasets. We contend that the future of language technology, particularly for low-resource and under-documented languages, must move beyond static data collection pipelines toward interactive, uncertainty-driven discovery, where learning emerges dynamically from human-machine collaboration instead of being limited to pre-existing datasets. We propose a framework grounded in joint human-machine uncertainty, combining epistemic uncertainty from the model with hesitation cues and confidence signals from human speakers to guide interaction, query selection, and memory retention. This paper is a call to action: we advocate a rethinking of how AI engages with human knowledge in under-documented languages, moving from extractive data collection toward participatory, co-adaptive learning processes that respect and empower communities while discovering and preserving the world's linguistic diversity. This vision aligns with principles of human-centered AI, emphasizing interactive, cooperative model building between AI systems and speakers.",

Existing approaches that discover safety vulnerabilities either rely on manual red-teaming with human experts or employ automated methods using pre-defined templates and human-curated attack data, with most focusing on single-turn attacks. However, these methods did not explore the vast space of possible multi-turn attacks, failing to consider novel attack trajectories that emerge from complex dialogue dynamics and strategic conversation planning. This gap is particularly critical given recent findings that LLMs exhibit significantly higher vulnerability to multi-turn attacks compared to single-turn attacks. We propose DialTree-RPO, an on-policy reinforcement learning framework integrated with tree search that autonomously discovers diverse multi-turn attack strategies by treating the dialogue as a sequential decision-making problem, enabling systematic exploration without manually curated data. Through extensive experiments, our approach not only achieves more than 25.9% higher ASR across 10 target models compared to previous state-of-the-art approaches, but also effectively uncovers new attack strategies by learning optimal dialogue policies that maximize attack success across multiple turns.",

Doing so requires realizing the most relevant primitives, intermediate results, or shared procedures, and building upon them. While RL post-training on long chains of thought ultimately aims to uncover this kind of algorithmic behavior, most reasoning traces learned by large models fail to consistently capture or reuse procedures, instead drifting into verbose and degenerate exploration. To address more effective reasoning, we introduce reasoning abstractions: concise natural language descriptions of procedural and factual knowledge that guide the model toward learning successful reasoning. We train models to be capable of proposing multiple abstractions given a problem, followed by RL that incentivizes building a solution while using the information provided by these abstractions. This results in a two-player RL training paradigm, abbreviated as RLAD, that jointly trains an abstraction generator and a solution generator. This setup effectively enables structured exploration, decouples learning signals of abstraction proposal and solution generation, and improves generalization to harder problems. We also show that allocating more test-time compute to generating abstractions is more beneficial for performance than generating more solutions at large test budgets, illustrating the role of abstractions in guiding meaningful exploration.",

In this paper, we are the first to investigate what makes a reasoning experience valuable and identify rollout correctness and entropy as effective indicators of experience value. Based on these insights, we propose ExGRPO (Experiential Group Relative Policy Optimization), a framework that organizes and prioritizes valuable experiences, and employs a mixed-policy objective to balance exploration with experience exploitation. Experiments on five backbone models (1.5B-8B parameters) show that ExGRPO consistently improves reasoning performance on mathematical/general benchmarks, with an average gain of +3.5/7.6 points over on-policy RLVR. Moreover, ExGRPO stabilizes training on both stronger and weaker models where on-policy methods fail.

This paper investigates the shrinkage issue of RLVR by analyzing its learning dynamics and reveals two critical phenomena that explain this failure. First, we expose negative interference in RLVR, where learning to solve certain training problems actively reduces the likelihood of correct solutions for others, leading to the decline of Pass@$k$ performance, or the probability of generating a correct solution within $k$ attempts. Second, we uncover the winner-take-all phenomenon: RLVR disproportionately reinforces problems with high likelihood, correct solutions, under the base model, while suppressing other initially low-likelihood ones. Through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we show that this effect arises from the inherent on-policy sampling in standard RL objectives, causing the model to converge toward narrow solution strategies. Based on these insights, we propose a simple yet effective data curation algorithm that focuses RLVR learning on low-likelihood problems, achieving notable improvement in Pass@$k$ performance.

While prior benchmarks have evaluated LLM agents in domains such as software engineering and scientific discovery, the finance domain remains underexplored, despite its direct relevance to economic value and high-stakes decision-making. Existing financial benchmarks primarily test static knowledge through question answering, but they fall short of capturing the dynamic and iterative nature of trading. To address this gap, we introduce StockBench, a contamination-free benchmark designed to evaluate LLM agents in realistic, multi-month stock trading environments. Agents receive daily market signals -- including prices, fundamentals, and news -- and must make sequential buy, sell, or hold decisions. Performance is assessed using financial metrics such as cumulative return, maximum drawdown, and the Sortino ratio. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art proprietary (e.g., GPT-5, Claude-4) and open-weight (e.g., Qwen3, Kimi-K2, GLM-4.5) models shows that while most LLM agents struggle to outperform the simple buy-and-hold baseline, several models demonstrate the potential to deliver higher returns and manage risk more effectively. These findings highlight both the challenges and opportunities in developing LLM-powered financial agents, showing that excelling at static financial knowledge tasks does not necessarily translate into successful trading strategies.

As a representative embodiment, Deep Research Agents (DRAs) systematically exhibit the capabilities for task decomposition, cross-source retrieval, multi-stage reasoning, and structured output, which markedly enhance performance on complex and open-ended tasks. However, existing benchmarks remain deficient in evaluation dimensions, response formatting, and scoring mechanisms, limiting their capacity to assess such systems effectively. This paper introduces a rigorous benchmark and a multidimensional evaluation framework tailored to DRAs and report-style responses. The benchmark comprises 214 expert-curated challenging queries distributed across 10 broad thematic domains, each accompanied by manually constructed reference bundles to support composite evaluation. The framework enables comprehensive evaluation of long-form reports generated by DRAs, incorporating integrated scoring metrics for semantic quality, topical focus, and retrieval trustworthiness. Extensive experimentation confirms the superior performance of mainstream DRAs over web-search-tool-augmented reasoning models, yet reveals considerable scope for further improvement.

        "summary": "OpenAI's o3-preview reasoning model exceeded human accuracy on the ARC-AGI benchmark, but does that mean state-of-the-art models recognize and reason with the abstractions that the task creators intended? We investigate models' abstraction abilities on ConceptARC. We evaluate models under settings that vary the input modality (textual vs. visual), whether the model is permitted to use external Python tools, and, for reasoning models, the amount of reasoning effort. In addition to measuring output accuracy, we perform fine-grained evaluation of the natural-language rules that models generate to explain their solutions. This dual evaluation lets us assess whether models solve tasks using the abstractions ConceptARC was designed to elicit, rather than relying on surface-level patterns. Our results show that, while some models using text-based representations match human output accuracy, the best models' rules are often based on surface-level ``shortcuts'' and capture intended abstractions far less often than humans. Thus their capabilities for general abstract reasoning may be overestimated by evaluations based on accuracy alone. In the visual modality, AI models' output accuracy drops sharply, yet our rule-level analysis reveals that models might be underestimated, as they still exhibit a substantial share of rules that capture intended abstractions, but are often unable to correctly apply these rules. In short, our results show that models still lag humans in abstract reasoning, and that using accuracy alone to evaluate abstract reasoning on ARC-like tasks may overestimate abstract-reasoning capabilities in textual modalities and underestimate it in visual modalities. We believe that our evaluation framework offers a more faithful picture of multimodal models' abstract reasoning abilities and a more principled way to track progress toward human-like, abstraction-centered intelligence.",

Existing approaches to constrained generation fall along a spectrum: greedy constrained decoding methods enforce validity during decoding but distort the LM's distribution, while rejection sampling (RS) preserves fidelity but wastes computation by discarding invalid outputs. Both extremes are problematic in domains such as program fuzzing, where both validity and diversity of samples are essential. We present Constrained Adaptive Rejection Sampling (CARS), an approach that strictly improves the sample-efficiency of RS without distributional distortion. CARS begins with unconstrained LM sampling and adaptively rules out constraint-violating continuations by recording them in a trie and subtracting their probability mass from future draws. This adaptive pruning ensures that prefixes proven invalid are never revisited, acceptance rates improve monotonically, and the resulting samples exactly follow the constrained distribution. In experiments on a variety of domains -- e.g., program fuzzing and molecular generation -- CARS consistently achieves higher efficiency -- measured in the number of LM forward passes per valid sample -- while also producing stronger sample diversity than both GCD and methods that approximate the LM's distribution.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning abilities in complex tasks, often relying on Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning. However, due to their autoregressive token-level generation, the reasoning process is largely constrained to local decision-making and lacks global planning. This limitation frequently results in redundant, incoherent, or inaccurate reasoning, which significantly degrades overall performance. Existing approaches, such as tree-based algorithms and reinforcement learning (RL), attempt to address this issue but suffer from high computational costs and often fail to produce optimal reasoning trajectories. To tackle this challenge, we propose Plan-Then-Action Enhanced Reasoning with Group Relative Policy Optimization PTA-GRPO, a two-stage framework designed to improve both high-level planning and fine-grained CoT reasoning. In the first stage, we leverage advanced LLMs to distill CoT into compact high-level guidance, which is then used for supervised fine-tuning (SFT). In the second stage, we introduce a guidance-aware RL method that jointly optimizes the final output and the quality of high-level guidance, thereby enhancing reasoning effectiveness. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including MATH, AIME2024, AIME2025, and AMC, across diverse base models such as Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, Qwen3-8B, Qwen3-14B, and LLaMA3.2-3B.

While highly successful, these methods do not reduce the fundamental number of floating-point operations (FLOPs) required for the attention score computation, which remains a critical bottleneck for training and full-sequence processing. This paper introduces Sparse Query Attention (SQA), a novel attention architecture that pursues an alternative and complementary optimization path. Instead of reducing Key/Value heads, SQA reduces the number of Query heads. This architectural modification directly decreases the computational complexity of the attention mechanism by a factor proportional to the reduction in query heads, thereby lowering the overall FLOPs. This work presents the theoretical foundation of SQA, its mathematical formulation, and a family of architectural variants. Empirical benchmarks on long sequences (32k-200k tokens) demonstrate that SQA can achieve significant throughput improvements of up to 3x in computation-bound scenarios such as model pre-training, fine-tuning, and encoder-based tasks, with only a minimal impact on model quality in preliminary smallscale experiments. SQA was discovered serendipitously during the development of the upcoming Reactive Transformer architecture, suggesting its potential as a powerful tool for building more efficient and scalable models",

We have no methods for perfect evaluation of the end state, and instead measure performance on small tests designed to provide directional indication that we are approaching AGI. In this work we argue that AGI evaluation methods have been dominated by a design philosophy that uses our intuitions of what intelligence is to create synthetic tasks, that have performed poorly in the history of AI. Instead we argue for an alternative design philosophy focused on evaluating robust task execution that seeks to demonstrate AGI through competence. This perspective is developed from common practices in data science that are used to show that a system can be reliably deployed. We provide practical examples of what this would mean for AGI evaluation.",

        "summary": "Computer-Use Agents (CUAs) are an increasingly deployed class of agents that take actions on GUIs to accomplish user goals. In this paper, we show that CUAs consistently exhibit Blind Goal-Directedness (BGD): a bias to pursue goals regardless of feasibility, safety, reliability, or context. We characterize three prevalent patterns of BGD: (i) lack of contextual reasoning, (ii) assumptions and decisions under ambiguity, and (iii) contradictory or infeasible goals. We develop BLIND-ACT, a benchmark of 90 tasks capturing these three patterns. Built on OSWorld, BLIND-ACT provides realistic environments and employs LLM-based judges to evaluate agent behavior, achieving 93.75% agreement with human annotations. We use BLIND-ACT to evaluate nine frontier models, including Claude Sonnet and Opus 4, Computer-Use-Preview, and GPT-5, observing high average BGD rates (80.8%) across them. We show that BGD exposes subtle risks that arise even when inputs are not directly harmful. While prompting-based interventions lower BGD levels, substantial risk persists, highlighting the need for stronger training- or inference-time interventions. Qualitative analysis reveals observed failure modes: execution-first bias (focusing on how to act over whether to act), thought-action disconnect (execution diverging from reasoning), and request-primacy (justifying actions due to user request). Identifying BGD and introducing BLIND-ACT establishes a foundation for future research on studying and mitigating this fundamental risk and ensuring safe CUA deployment.",

This position paper argues that the privacy landscape of LLM systems extends far beyond training data extraction, encompassing risks from data collection practices, inference-time context leakage, autonomous agent capabilities, and the democratization of surveillance through deep inference attacks. We present a comprehensive taxonomy of privacy risks across the LLM lifecycle -- from data collection through deployment -- and demonstrate through case studies how current privacy frameworks fail to address these multifaceted threats. Through a longitudinal analysis of 1,322 AI/ML privacy papers published at leading conferences over the past decade (2016--2025), we reveal that while memorization receives outsized attention in technical research, the most pressing privacy harms lie elsewhere, where current technical approaches offer little traction and viable paths forward remain unclear. We call for a fundamental shift in how the research community approaches LLM privacy, moving beyond the narrow focus of current technical solutions and embracing interdisciplinary approaches that address the sociotechnical nature of these emerging threats.",

        "summary": "Training data plays a crucial role in Large Language Models (LLM) scaling, yet high quality data is of limited supply. Synthetic data techniques offer a potential path toward sidestepping these limitations. We conduct a large-scale empirical investigation (>1000 LLMs with >100k GPU hours) using a unified protocol and scaling laws, comparing natural web data, diverse synthetic types (rephrased text, generated textbooks), and mixtures of natural and synthetic data. Specifically, we found pre-training on rephrased synthetic data \\textit{alone} is not faster than pre-training on natural web texts; while pre-training on 1/3 rephrased synthetic data mixed with 2/3 natural web texts can speed up 5-10x (to reach the same validation loss) at larger data budgets. Pre-training on textbook-style synthetic data \\textit{alone} results in notably higher loss on many downstream domains especially at small data budgets. \"Good\" ratios of synthetic data in training data mixtures depend on the model size and data budget, empirically converging to ~30% for rephrased synthetic data. Larger generator models do not necessarily yield better pre-training data than ~8B-param models. These results contribute mixed evidence on \"model collapse\" during large-scale single-round (n=1) model training on synthetic data--training on rephrased synthetic data shows no degradation in performance in foreseeable scales whereas training on mixtures of textbook-style pure-generated synthetic data shows patterns predicted by \"model collapse\". Our work demystifies synthetic data in pre-training, validates its conditional benefits, and offers practical guidance.",

        "summary": "In post-training for reasoning Large Language Models (LLMs), the current state of practice trains LLMs in two independent stages: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR, shortened as ``RL'' below). In this work, we challenge whether high SFT scores translate to improved performance after RL. We provide extensive counter-examples where this is not true. We find high SFT scores can be biased toward simpler or more homogeneous data and are not reliably predictive of subsequent RL gains or scaled-up post-training effectiveness. In some cases, RL training on models with improved SFT performance could lead to substantially worse outcome compared to RL on the base model without SFT. We study alternative metrics and identify generalization loss on held-out reasoning examples and Pass@large k performance to provide strong proxies for the RL outcome. We trained hundreds of models up to 12B-parameter with SFT and RLVR via GRPO and ran extensive evaluations on 7 math benchmarks with up to 256 repetitions, spending $>$1M GPU hours. Experiments include models from Llama3, Mistral-Nemo, Qwen3 and multiple state-of-the-art SFT/RL datasets. Compared to directly predicting from pre-RL performance, prediction based on generalization loss and Pass@large k achieves substantial higher precision, improving $R^2$ coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient by up to 0.5 (2x). This provides strong utility for broad use cases. For example, in most experiments, we find SFT training on unique examples for a one epoch underperforms training on half examples for two epochs, either after SFT or SFT-then-RL; With the same SFT budget, training only on short examples may lead to better SFT performance, though, it often leads to worse outcome after RL compared to training on examples with varying lengths.

Our framework leverages advanced large language models as the backbone while incorporating specialized modules for cross-modal understanding, contextual knowledge integration, bias mitigation, explanation synthesis, and continuous model adaptation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets (MovieLens-25M, Amazon-Electronics, Yelp-2023) demonstrate consistent improvements in recommendation accuracy, fairness, and diversity compared to existing approaches.

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across a wide range of industries, primarily due to their impressive generative abilities. Yet, their potential in applications requiring cognitive abilities, such as psychological counseling, remains largely untapped. This paper investigates the key question: Can LLMs be effectively applied to psychological counseling? To determine whether an LLM can effectively take on the role of a psychological counselor, the first step is to assess whether it meets the qualifications required for such a role, namely the ability to pass the U.S. National Counselor Certification Exam (NCE). This is because, just as a human counselor must pass a certification exam to practice, an LLM must demonstrate sufficient psychological knowledge to meet the standards required for such a role. To address this, we introduce PsychoBench, a benchmark grounded in U.S.national counselor examinations, a licensure test for professional counselors that requires about 70% accuracy to pass. PsychoBench comprises approximately 2,252 carefully curated single-choice questions, crafted to require deep understanding and broad enough to cover various sub-disciplines of psychology. This benchmark provides a comprehensive assessment of an LLM's ability to function as a counselor. Our evaluation shows that advanced models such as GPT-4o, Llama3.3-70B, and Gemma3-27B achieve well above the passing threshold, while smaller open-source models (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B, Mistral-7B) remain far below it. These results suggest that only frontier LLMs are currently capable of meeting counseling exam standards, highlighting both the promise and the challenges of developing psychology-oriented LLMs.",

        "summary": "Recent research has explored using Large Language Models for recommendation tasks by transforming user interaction histories and item metadata into text prompts, then having the LLM produce rankings or recommendations. A promising approach involves connecting collaborative filtering knowledge to LLM representations through compact adapter networks, which avoids expensive fine-tuning while preserving the strengths of both components. Yet several challenges persist in practice: collaborative filtering models often use static snapshots that miss rapidly changing user preferences; many real-world items contain rich visual and audio content beyond textual descriptions; and current systems struggle to provide trustworthy explanations backed by concrete evidence. Our work introduces \\model{}, a framework that tackles these limitations through three key innovations. We develop an online adaptation mechanism that continuously incorporates new user interactions through lightweight modules, avoiding the need to retrain large models. We create a unified representation that seamlessly combines collaborative signals with visual and audio features, handling cases where some modalities may be unavailable. Finally, we design an explanation system that grounds recommendations in specific collaborative patterns and item attributes, producing natural language rationales users can verify. Our approach maintains the efficiency of frozen base models while adding minimal computational overhead, making it practical for real-world deployment.",

        "summary": "Recent thinking models solve complex reasoning tasks by scaling test-time compute, but this scaling must be allocated in line with task difficulty. On one hand, short reasoning (underthinking) leads to errors on harder problems that require extended reasoning steps; but, excessively long reasoning (overthinking) can be token-inefficient, generating unnecessary steps even after reaching a correct intermediate solution. We refer to this as under-adaptivity, where the model fails to modulate its response length appropriately given problems of varying difficulty. To address under-adaptivity and strike a balance between under- and overthinking, we propose TRAAC (Think Right with Adaptive, Attentive Compression), an online post-training RL method that leverages the model's self-attention over a long reasoning trajectory to identify important steps and prune redundant ones. TRAAC also estimates difficulty and incorporates it into training rewards, thereby learning to allocate reasoning budget commensurate with example difficulty. Our approach improves accuracy, reduces reasoning steps, and enables adaptive thinking compared to base models and other RL baselines. Across a variety of tasks (AIME, AMC, GPQA-D, BBEH), TRAAC (Qwen3-4B) achieves an average absolute accuracy gain of 8.4% with a relative reduction in reasoning length of 36.8% compared to the base model, and a 7.9% accuracy gain paired with a 29.4% length drop compared to the best RL baseline. TRAAC also shows strong generalization: although our models are trained on math datasets, they show accuracy and efficiency gains on out-of-distribution non-math datasets like GPQA-D, BBEH, and OptimalThinkingBench. Our analysis further verifies that TRAAC provides fine-grained adjustments to thinking budget based on difficulty and that a combination of task-difficulty calibration and attention-based compression yields gains across diverse tasks.",

This method addresses the inherent bias in engagement signals collected from live query autocomplete interactions, where model suggestions influence user behavior. Our neural ranker is optimized for real-time deployment under strict latency constraints and incorporates a rich set of features, including query popularity, seasonality, fuzzy match scores, and contextual signals such as department affinity, device type, and vertical alignment with previous user queries. To support efficient training, we introduce a task-specific simplification of the listwise loss, reducing computational complexity from $O(n^2)$ to $O(n)$ by leveraging the query autocomplete structure of having only one ground-truth selection per prefix. Deployed in a large-scale e-commerce setting, our system demonstrates statistically significant improvements in user engagement, as measured by mean reciprocal rank and related metrics. Our findings show that synthetic prefixes not only improve generalization but also provide a scalable path toward bias mitigation in other low-latency ranking tasks, including related searches and query recommendations.",

Our method reveals three key findings: (i) safety improvements show stronger scaling with model size compared to existing safety methods. (ii) InvThink mitigates safety tax; by training models to systematically consider failure modes, it preserves general reasoning capabilities on standard benchmarks. (iii) beyond general safety tasks, InvThink excels in high-stakes domains including external-facing (medicine, finance, law) and agentic (blackmail, murder) risk scenarios, achieving up to 15.7% reduction in harmful responses compared to baseline methods like SafetyPrompt. We further implement InvThink via supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning across three LLM families.

        "summary": "Explicit information seeking is essential to human problem-solving in practical environments characterized by incomplete information and noisy dynamics. When the true environmental state is not directly observable, humans seek information to update their internal dynamics and inform future decision-making. Although existing Large Language Model (LLM) planning agents have addressed observational uncertainty, they often overlook discrepancies between their internal dynamics and the actual environment. We introduce Information Seeking Decision Planner (InfoSeeker), an LLM decision-making framework that integrates task-oriented planning with information seeking to align internal dynamics and make optimal decisions under uncertainty in both agent observations and environmental dynamics. InfoSeeker prompts an LLM to actively gather information by planning actions to validate its understanding, detect environmental changes, or test hypotheses before generating or revising task-oriented plans. To evaluate InfoSeeker, we introduce a novel benchmark suite featuring partially observable environments with incomplete observations and uncertain dynamics. Experiments demonstrate that InfoSeeker achieves a 74% absolute performance gain over prior methods without sacrificing sample efficiency. Moreover, InfoSeeker generalizes across LLMs and outperforms baselines on established benchmarks such as robotic manipulation and web navigation. These findings underscore the importance of tightly integrating planning and information seeking for robust behavior in partially observable environments.

Recent work has largely focused on modifying loss functions to make RLVR more efficient and effective. In this paper, motivated by studies of overthinking in LLMs, we propose Length-aware Sampling for Policy Optimization (LSPO), a novel meta-RLVR algorithm that dynamically selects training data at each step based on the average response length. We evaluate LSPO across multiple base models and datasets, demonstrating that it consistently improves learning effectiveness. In addition, we conduct a detailed ablation study to examine alternative ways of incorporating length signals into dynamic sampling, offering further insights and highlighting promising directions for future research.",

        "summary": "Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) improves reasoning in large language models (LLMs) but struggles with exploration, an issue that still persists for multimodal LLMs (MLLMs). Current methods treat the visual input as a fixed, deterministic condition, overlooking a critical source of ambiguity and struggling to build policies robust to plausible visual variations. We introduce $\\textbf{VOGUE (Visual Uncertainty Guided Exploration)}$, a novel method that shifts exploration from the output (text) to the input (visual) space. By treating the image as a stochastic context, VOGUE quantifies the policy's sensitivity to visual perturbations using the symmetric KL divergence between a \"raw\" and \"noisy\" branch, creating a direct signal for uncertainty-aware exploration. This signal shapes the learning objective via an uncertainty-proportional bonus, which, combined with a token-entropy bonus and an annealed sampling schedule, effectively balances exploration and exploitation. Implemented within GRPO on two model scales (Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B), VOGUE boosts pass@1 accuracy by an average of 2.6% on three visual math benchmarks and 3.7% on three general-domain reasoning benchmarks, while simultaneously increasing pass@4 performance and mitigating the exploration decay commonly observed in RL fine-tuning. Our work shows that grounding exploration in the inherent uncertainty of visual inputs is an effective strategy for improving multimodal reasoning.",

        "summary": "Large language model (LLM) generation often requires balancing output quality against inference cost, especially when using multiple generations. We introduce a new framework for inference-time optimization based on the classical Pandora's Box problem. Viewing each generation as opening a costly \"box\" with random reward, we develop algorithms that decide when to stop generating without knowing the underlying reward distribution. Our first contribution is a UCB-style Pandora's Box algorithm, which achieves performance that is provably close to Weitzman's algorithm, the optimal strategy when the distribution is known. We further adapt this method to practical LLM settings by addressing reward scaling across prompts via a Bradley-Terry inspired transformation. This leads to an adaptive inference-time optimization method that normalizes rewards and learns stopping thresholds on the fly. Experiments on the AlpacaFarm and HH-RLHF datasets, using multiple LLM-reward model pairs, show that our adaptive strategy can obtain the same performance as non-adaptive Best-of-N sampling while requiring 15-35 percent fewer generations on average. Our results establish a principled bridge between optimal stopping theory and inference-time scaling, providing both theoretical performance bounds and practical efficiency gains for LLM deployment.",

        "summary": "Large language model (LLM) agents deployed for multi-step tasks frequently fail in predictable ways: attempting actions with unmet preconditions, issuing redundant commands, or mishandling environment constraints. While retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) can improve performance by providing runtime guidance, it requires maintaining external knowledge databases and adds computational overhead at every deployment. We propose a simple pipeline that converts inference-time retrieval into learned competence through distillation. Our approach: (1) extracts compact, reusable hints from agent failures, (2) uses these hints to generate improved teacher trajectories via one-shot retrieval at episode start, and (3) trains student models on these trajectories with hint strings removed, forcing internalization rather than memorization. Across two interactive benchmarks, ALFWorld (household tasks) and WebShop (online shopping), distilled students consistently outperform baseline agents, achieving up to 91% success on ALFWorld (vs. 79% for baselines) and improving WebShop scores to 72 (vs. 61 for baselines), while using 10-60% fewer tokens than retrieval-augmented teachers depending on the environment. The approach generalizes across model scales (7B/14B parameters) and agent architectures (ReAct/StateAct), demonstrating that retrieval benefits can be effectively internalized through targeted fine-tuning without permanent runtime dependencies.",

This behavior may be explicit, i.e. verbalized in the model's chain-of-thought (CoT), or implicit, where the CoT appears benign thus bypasses CoT monitors. To detect implicit reward hacking, we propose TRACE (Truncated Reasoning AUC Evaluation). Our key observation is that hacking occurs when exploiting the loophole is easier than solving the actual task. This means that the model is using less `effort' than required to achieve high reward. TRACE quantifies effort by measuring how early a model's reasoning becomes sufficient to pass a verifier. We progressively truncate a model's CoT at various lengths, force the model to answer, and measure the verifier-passing rate at each cutoff. A hacking model, which takes a shortcut, will achieve a high passing rate with only a small fraction of its CoT, yielding a large area under the accuracy-vs-length curve. TRACE achieves over 65% gains over our strongest 72B CoT monitor in math reasoning, and over 30% gains over a 32B monitor in coding. We further show that TRACE can discover unknown loopholes during training. Overall, TRACE offers a scalable unsupervised approach for oversight where current monitoring methods prove ineffective.",

Next, we systematize both text-based and image-based detection methods. Finally, we evaluate their performance across multiple scenarios. Our key findings show that while some detectors can identify attacks that rely on explicit textual instructions or visible image perturbations with moderate to high accuracy, they largely fail against attacks that omit explicit instructions or employ imperceptible perturbations.

Each benchmark instance provides a chronologically platform-interleaved timeline, with noisy, conflicting, cross-referring information as well as potential codebase/file-system comprehension and exploration. Consequently, our benchmark tests memory capabilities such as acquistion, selection and conflict resolution. We curate the MEMTRACK dataset through both manual expert driven design and scalable agent based synthesis, generating ecologically valid scenarios grounded in real world software development processes. We introduce pertinent metrics for Correctness, Efficiency, and Redundancy that capture the effectiveness of memory mechanisms beyond simple QA performance. Experiments across SoTA LLMs and memory backends reveal challenges in utilizing memory across long horizons, handling cross-platform dependencies, and resolving contradictions. Notably, the best performing GPT-5 model only achieves a 60\\% Correctness score on MEMTRACK.

        "summary": "Although current large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have advanced in multimodal understanding and reasoning, their fundamental perceptual and reasoning abilities remain limited. Specifically, even on simple jigsaw tasks, existing VLMs perform near randomly, revealing deficiencies in core perception and reasoning capabilities. While high-quality vision-language data can enhance these capabilities, its scarcity and limited scalability impose significant constraints. To address this, we propose AGILE, an Agentic jiGsaw Interaction Learning for Enhancing visual perception and reasoning in VLMs. AGILE formulates jigsaw solving as an interactive process, enabling the model to progressively engage with the environment. At each step, the model generates executable code to perform an action based on the current state, while the environment provides fine-grained visual feedback to guide task completion. Through this iterative cycle of observation and interaction, the model incrementally improves its perceptual and reasoning capabilities via exploration and feedback. Experimental results show that AGILE not only substantially boosts performance on jigsaw tasks of varying complexity (e.g., increasing accuracy from 9.5% to 82.8% under the 2 $\\times$ 2 setting) but also demonstrates strong generalization across 9 general vision tasks, achieving an average improvement of 3.1%. These results indicate notable enhancements in both perceptual and reasoning abilities. This work opens a new avenue for advancing reasoning and generalization in multimodal models and provides an efficient, scalable solution to the scarcity of multimodal reinforcement learning data.

        "summary": "The dominant paradigm for training large reasoning models starts with pre-training using next-token prediction loss on vast amounts of data. Reinforcement learning, while powerful in scaling reasoning, is introduced only as the very last phase of post-training, preceded by supervised fine-tuning. While dominant, is this an optimal way of training? In this paper, we present RLP, an information-driven reinforcement pretraining objective, that brings the core spirit of reinforcement learning -- exploration -- to the last phase of pretraining. The key idea is to treat chain-of-thought as an exploratory action, with rewards computed based on the information gain it provides for predicting future tokens. This training objective essentially encourages the model to think for itself before predicting what comes next, thus teaching an independent thinking behavior earlier in the pretraining. More concretely, the reward signal measures the increase in log-likelihood of the next token when conditioning on both context and a sampled reasoning chain, compared to conditioning on context alone. This approach yields a verifier-free dense reward signal, allowing for efficient training for the full document stream during pretraining. Specifically, RLP reframes reinforcement learning for reasoning as a pretraining objective on ordinary text, bridging the gap between next-token prediction and the emergence of useful chain-of-thought reasoning. Pretraining with RLP on Qwen3-1.7B-Base lifts the overall average across an eight-benchmark math-and-science suite by 19%. With identical post-training, the gains compound, with the largest improvements on reasoning-heavy tasks such as AIME25 and MMLU-Pro. Applying RLP to the hybrid Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2 increases the overall average from 42.81% to 61.32% and raises the average on scientific reasoning by 23%, demonstrating scalability across architectures and model sizes.",

        "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing tasks. However, their exponentially increasing parameters pose significant challenges for deployment on resource-constrained devices. Vector Quantization (VQ) shows great promise for low-bit quantization (e.g., 2 to 4 bits), but existing work faces two key challenges: unconstrained direction error and suboptimal bit allocation. In this paper, we propose RSAVQ, a novel VQ framework to enhance extremely low-bit quantization for LLMs. RSAVQ introduces two geometry-driven innovations that effectively mitigate above limitations: (1) Error Direction Sensitivity Guidance (EDSG), which leverages the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM)-induced Riemannian metric to project quantization errors onto low-sensitivity directions in the parameter space. Specifically, this projection is performed along the negative natural gradient direction, which effectively suppresses error expansion. (2) Weight Channel Sensitivity Guidance (WCSG) , which constructs a channel-wise sensitivity metric via FIM curvature analysis to dynamically guide bit resource allocation. The approach facilitates a globally optimal quantization solution within prescribed bit constraints. Experiments demonstrate that RSAVQ outperforms existing methods for LLMs. For example, in 2-bit quantization of LLaMA-3 8B, RSAVQ leads baselines like VPTQ and QuIP# by 0.4 in perplexity (PPL) and 1.5 in zero-shot accuracy. This work offers a practical solution for constrained environments and a theoretical bridge between information geometry and the quantization of neural networks, advancing efficient deep learning.",

The pipeline integrates dynamic token allocation, zeroshot multi-agent extraction, and conditional table parsing to balance accuracy against computational cost. Benchmarking on 50 curated papers shows that GPT-4.1 achieves the highest accuracy (F1 = 0.91 for thermoelectric properties and 0.82 for structural fields), while GPT-4.1 Mini delivers nearly comparable performance (F1 = 0.89 and 0.81) at a fraction of the cost, enabling practical large scale deployment. Applying this workflow, we curated 27,822 temperature resolved property records with normalized units, spanning figure of merit (ZT), Seebeck coefficient, conductivity, resistivity, power factor, and thermal conductivity, together with structural attributes such as crystal class, space group, and doping strategy. Dataset analysis reproduces known thermoelectric trends, such as the superior performance of alloys over oxides and the advantage of p-type doping, while also surfacing broader structure-property correlations.

In this work, we are the first to find and systematically verify that LLMs' alignment defenses are not sensitive to nested scenarios, where these scenarios are highly semantically relevant to the queries and incorporate targeted toxic knowledge. This is a crucial yet insufficiently explored direction. Based on this, we propose RTS-Attack (Semantically Relevant Nested Scenarios with Targeted Toxic Knowledge), an adaptive and automated framework to examine LLMs' alignment. By building scenarios highly relevant to the queries and integrating targeted toxic knowledge, RTS-Attack bypasses the alignment defenses of LLMs. Moreover, the jailbreak prompts generated by RTS-Attack are free from harmful queries, leading to outstanding concealment.

We demonstrate that the loss of accuracy is caused by sampling incorrect continuations in sensitive decoding positions. To address this, in this paper, we propose \\textbf{selective sampling}, a method that dynamically switches between greedy and high-temperature sampling based on a sampling risk metric. This risk metric estimates the likelihood of output errors when applying high-temperature sampling on the current token position. To predict sampling risk, we train a lightweight classifier on a small subset of verifiable problems. The trained classifier can be integrated with the base language model with minimal latency overhead.

Although biosignal modalities differ in functionality, signal fidelity, sensor comfort, and cost, they are often intercorrelated, reflecting the holistic and interconnected nature of human physiology. This opens up the possibility of performing the same tasks using alternative biosignal modalities, thereby improving the accessibility, usability, and adaptability of health monitoring systems. However, the limited availability of large labeled datasets presents challenges for training models tailored to specific tasks and modalities of interest. Unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer offers a promising solution by leveraging knowledge from an existing modality to support model training for a new modality. Existing methods are typically based on knowledge distillation, which requires running a teacher model alongside student model training, resulting in high computational and memory overhead. This challenge is further exacerbated by the recent development of foundation models that demonstrate superior performance and generalization across tasks at the cost of large model sizes. To this end, we explore a new framework for unsupervised cross-modal knowledge transfer of biosignals by training a lightweight bridge network to align the intermediate representations and enable information flow between foundation models and across modalities. Specifically, we introduce an efficient strategy for selecting alignment positions where the bridge should be constructed, along with a flexible prototype network as the bridge architecture. Extensive experiments across multiple biosignal modalities, tasks, and datasets show that BioX-Bridge reduces the number of trainable parameters by 88--99\\% while maintaining or even improving transfer performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress across a wide range of tasks, but remain vulnerable to safety risks such as harmful content generation and jailbreak attacks. Existing safety techniques -- including external guardrails, inference-time guidance, and post-training alignment -- each face limitations in balancing safety, utility, and controllability. In this work, we propose UpSafe$^\\circ$C, a unified framework for enhancing LLM safety through safety-aware upcycling. Our approach first identifies safety-critical layers and upcycles them into a sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure, where the router acts as a soft guardrail that selectively activates original MLPs and added safety experts. We further introduce a two-stage SFT strategy to strengthen safety discrimination while preserving general capabilities. To enable flexible control at inference time, we introduce a safety temperature mechanism, allowing dynamic adjustment of the trade-off between safety and utility. Experiments across multiple benchmarks, base model, and model scales demonstrate that UpSafe$^\\circ$C achieves robust safety improvements against harmful and jailbreak inputs, while maintaining competitive performance on general tasks. Moreover, analysis shows that safety temperature provides fine-grained inference-time control that achieves the Pareto-optimal frontier between utility and safety. Our results highlight a new direction for LLM safety: moving from static alignment toward dynamic, modular, and inference-aware control.",

By probabilistically modeling layout patterns, visual structure, and content variability, FlexDoc enables the controlled generation of diverse document variants at scale. Experiments on Key Information Extraction (KIE) tasks demonstrate that FlexDoc-generated data improves the absolute F1 Score by up to 11% when used to augment real datasets, while reducing annotation effort by over 90% compared to traditional hard-template methods.

However, such claims are typically drawn from narrow evaluations and may overlook important aspects of model behavior. In this work, we present a systematic study of depth utilization across diverse dimensions, including evaluation protocols, task categories, and model architectures. Our analysis confirms that very deep layers are generally less effective than earlier ones, but their contributions vary substantially with the evaluation setting. Under likelihood-based metrics without generation, pruning most layers preserves performance, with only the initial few being critical. By contrast, generation-based evaluation uncovers indispensable roles for middle and deeper layers in enabling reasoning and maintaining long-range coherence. We further find that knowledge and retrieval are concentrated in shallow components, whereas reasoning accuracy relies heavily on deeper layers -- yet can be reshaped through distillation. These results highlight that depth usage in LLMs is highly heterogeneous and context-dependent, underscoring the need for task-, metric-, and model-aware perspectives in both interpreting and compressing large models.",

However, existing benchmarks provide only raw data points without semantic context, overlooking rich textual metadata such as feature descriptions and domain knowledge that experts rely on in practice. This limitation restricts research flexibility and prevents models from fully leveraging domain knowledge for detection. ReTabAD addresses this gap by restoring textual semantics to enable context-aware tabular AD research. We provide (1) 20 carefully curated tabular datasets enriched with structured textual metadata, together with implementations of state-of-the-art AD algorithms including classical, deep learning, and LLM-based approaches, and (2) a zero-shot LLM framework that leverages semantic context without task-specific training, establishing a strong baseline for future research. Furthermore, this work provides insights into the role and utility of textual metadata in AD through experiments and analysis. Results show that semantic context improves detection performance and enhances interpretability by supporting domain-aware reasoning.

The traditional human-only peer review regime lacks a scalable, objective benchmark, making editorial processes opaque and difficult to audit. Here we investigate a deterministic simulation framework that provides the first stable, evidence-based standard for evaluating AI-generated peer review reports. Analyzing 352 peer-review simulation reports, we identify consistent system state indicators that demonstrate its reliability. First, the system is able to simulate calibrated editorial judgment, with 'Revise' decisions consistently forming the majority outcome (>50%) across all disciplines, while 'Reject' rates dynamically adapt to field-specific norms, rising to 45% in Health Sciences. Second, it maintains unwavering procedural integrity, enforcing a stable 29% evidence-anchoring compliance rate that remains invariant across diverse review tasks and scientific domains. These findings demonstrate a system that is predictably rule-bound, mitigating the stochasticity of generative AI. For the scientific community, this provides a transparent tool to ensure fairness; for publishing strategists, it offers a scalable instrument for auditing workflows, managing integrity risks, and implementing evidence-based governance.

The learned reasoning reward serves two complementary roles: (i) it provides step-level feedback to optimise a reasoning policy during training; and (ii) it functions at inference as a critic to rerank sampled traces under fixed compute budgets. We demonstrate that our approach prioritises correctness over surface form, yielding scores that correlate with eventual answer validity and enabling interpretable localisation of errors within a trace. Empirically, on GSM8K with Llama3 and Qwen2.5 backbones, we demonstrate: (i) dense reasoning rewards can be used as a learning signal to elicit reasoning, and (ii) predictive performance is improved from reward-guided reranking (notably for Llama-based policies).

At the same time, this implies various challenges and risks regarding building and deploying human-AI teaming systems in an effective and ethical manner. Currently, understanding and coping with them are often tackled from an external perspective considering the human-AI teaming system as a collective agent. Nevertheless, zooming into the dynamics involved inside the system assures dealing with a broader palette of relevant multidimensional responsibility, safety, and robustness aspects. To this end, this research proposes the design of a trustworthy co-learning model for human-AI teaming in military operations that encompasses a continuous and bidirectional exchange of insights between the human and AI agents as they jointly adapt to evolving battlefield conditions. It does that by integrating four dimensions. First, adjustable autonomy for dynamically calibrating the autonomy levels of agents depending on aspects like mission state, system confidence, and environmental uncertainty. Second, multi-layered control which accounts continuous oversight, monitoring of activities, and accountability. Third, bidirectional feedback with explicit and implicit feedback loops between the agents to assure a proper communication of reasoning, uncertainties, and learned adaptations that each of the agents has. And fourth, collaborative decision-making which implies the generation, evaluation, and proposal of decisions associated with confidence levels and rationale behind them. The model proposed is accompanied by concrete exemplifications and recommendations that contribute to further developing responsible and trustworthy human-AI teaming systems in military operations.",

        "summary": "Mass spectrometry metabolomics generates vast amounts of data requiring advanced methods for interpretation. Knowledge graphs address these challenges by structuring mass spectrometry data, metabolite information, and their relationships into a connected network (Gaudry et al. 2024). However, effective use of a knowledge graph demands an in-depth understanding of its ontology and its query language syntax. To overcome this, we designed MetaboT, an AI system utilizing large language models (LLMs) to translate user questions into SPARQL semantic query language for operating on knowledge graphs (Steve Harris 2013). We demonstrate its effectiveness using the Experimental Natural Products Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), a large-scale public knowledge graph for plant natural products (Gaudry et al. 2024).MetaboT employs specialized AI agents for handling user queries and interacting with the knowledge graph by breaking down complex tasks into discrete components, each managed by a specialised agent (Fig. 1a). The multi-agent system is constructed using the LangChain and LangGraph libraries, which facilitate the integration of LLMs with external tools and information sources (LangChain, n.d.). The query generation process follows a structured workflow. First, the Entry Agent determines if the question is new or a follow-up to previous interactions. New questions are forwarded to the Validator Agent, which verifies if the question is related to the knowledge graph. Then, the valid question is sent to the Supervisor Agent, which identifies if the question requires chemical conversions or standardized identifiers. In this case it delegates the question to the Knowledge Graph Agent, which can use tools to extract necessary details, such as URIs or taxonomies of chemical names, from the user query. Finally, an agent responsible for crafting the SPARQL queries equipped with the ontology of the knowledge graph uses the provided identifiers to generate the query. Then, the system executes the generated query against the metabolomics knowledge graph and returns structured results to the user (Fig. 1b). To assess the performance of MetaboT we have curated 50 metabolomics-related questions and their expected answers. In addition to submitting these questions to MetaboT, we evaluated a baseline by submitting them to a standard LLM (GPT-4o) with a prompt that incorporated the knowledge graph ontology but did not provide specific entity IDs. This baseline achieved only 8.16% accuracy, compared to MetaboT's 83.67%, underscoring the necessity of our multi-agent system for accurately retrieving entities and generating correct SPARQL queries. MetaboT demonstrates promising performance as a conversational question-answering assistant, enabling researchers to retrieve structured metabolomics data through natural language queries. By automating the generation and execution of SPARQL queries, it removes technical barriers that have traditionally hindered access to knowledge graphs. Importantly, MetaboT leverages the capabilities of LLMs while maintaining experimentally grounded query generation, ensuring that outputs remain aligned with domain-specific standards and data structures. This approach facilitates data-driven discoveries by bridging the gap between complex semantic technologies and user-friendly interaction.

Using this framework, we develop the VaPR dataset, comprising 30K high-quality samples, to finetune three LVLM families: LLaVA-V1.5, Qwen2VL & Qwen2.5VL (2B-13B sizes).

A scaling analysis shows that performance consistently improves with data size, with LLaVA models benefiting even at smaller scales. Moreover, VaPR reduces the tendency to answer \"Yes\" in binary questions - addressing a common failure mode in LVLMs like LLaVA. Lastly, we show that the framework generalizes to open-source LLMs as editors, with models trained on VaPR-OS achieving ~99% of the performance of models trained on \\name, which is synthesized using GPT-4o.

        "summary": "Contextual Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) offer a framework for sequential decision-making under external signals, but existing methods often fail to generalize in high-dimensional or unstructured contexts, resulting in excessive computation and unstable performance. We propose an information-theoretic summarization approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to compress contextual inputs into low-dimensional, semantically rich summaries. These summaries augment states by preserving decision-critical cues while reducing redundancy. Building on the notion of approximate context sufficiency, we provide, to our knowledge, the first regret bounds and a latency-entropy trade-off characterization for CMDPs. Our analysis clarifies how informativeness impacts computational cost. Experiments across discrete, continuous, visual, and recommendation benchmarks show that our method outperforms raw-context and non-context baselines, improving reward, success rate, and sample efficiency, while reducing latency and memory usage. These findings demonstrate that LLM-based summarization offers a scalable and interpretable solution for efficient decision-making in context-rich, resource-constrained environments.",

However, existing approaches face substantial challenges in handling dynamic user preferences, maintaining conversation coherence, and balancing multiple ranking objectives simultaneously. This paper introduces AgentRec, a next-generation LLM-powered multi-agent collaborative recommendation framework that addresses these limitations through hierarchical agent networks with adaptive intelligence. Our approach employs specialized LLM-powered agents for conversation understanding, preference modeling, context awareness, and dynamic ranking, coordinated through an adaptive weighting mechanism that learns from interaction patterns.

        "summary": "LLM-based multi-agent systems excel at planning, tool use, and role coordination, but their openness and interaction complexity also expose them to jailbreak, prompt-injection, and adversarial collaboration. Existing defenses fall into two lines: (i) self-verification that asks each agent to pre-filter unsafe instructions before execution, and (ii) external guard modules that police behaviors. The former often underperforms because a standalone agent lacks sufficient capacity to detect cross-agent unsafe chains and delegation-induced risks; the latter increases system overhead and creates a single-point-of-failure-once compromised, system-wide safety collapses, and adding more guards worsens cost and complexity. To solve these challenges, we propose AdvEvo-MARL, a co-evolutionary multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that internalizes safety into task agents. Rather than relying on external guards, AdvEvo-MARL jointly optimizes attackers (which synthesize evolving jailbreak prompts) and defenders (task agents trained to both accomplish their duties and resist attacks) in adversarial learning environments. To stabilize learning and foster cooperation, we introduce a public baseline for advantage estimation: agents within the same functional group share a group-level mean-return baseline, enabling lower-variance updates and stronger intra-group coordination. Across representative attack scenarios, AdvEvo-MARL consistently keeps attack-success rate (ASR) below 20%, whereas baselines reach up to 38.33%, while preserving-and sometimes improving-task accuracy (up to +3.67% on reasoning tasks). These results show that safety and utility can be jointly improved without relying on extra guard agents or added system overhead.",

Current reinforcement learning approaches often rely on sparse, outcome-based rewards, which can reinforce flawed reasoning paths that lead to coincidentally correct answers. We argue that this stems from a fundamental mismatch with the natural structure of reasoning. We first propose a theoretical framework that formalizes complex problem solving as a hierarchical selection process, where an intractable global constraint is decomposed into a series of simpler, localized logical steps. This framework provides a principled foundation for algorithm design, including theoretical insights into the identifiability of this latent reasoning structure. Motivated by this theory, we identify unstructured refinement -- a failure mode where a model's iterative steps do not contribute meaningfully to the solution -- as a core deficiency in existing methods. We then introduce Step-Aware Policy Optimization (SAPO), a novel RL algorithm that aligns the dLLM's denoising process with the latent reasoning hierarchy. By using a process-based reward function that encourages incremental progress, SAPO guides the model to learn structured, coherent reasoning paths. Our empirical results show that this principled approach significantly improves performance on challenging reasoning benchmarks and enhances the interpretability of the generation process.",

        "summary": "High-assurance reasoning, particularly in critical domains such as law and medicine, requires conclusions that are accurate, verifiable, and explicitly grounded in evidence. This reasoning relies on premises codified from rules, statutes, and contracts, inherently involving defeasible or non-monotonic logic due to numerous exceptions, where the introduction of a single fact can invalidate general rules, posing significant challenges. While large language models (LLMs) excel at processing natural language, their capabilities in standard inference tasks do not translate to the rigorous reasoning required over high-assurance text guidelines. Core reasoning challenges within such texts often manifest specific logical structures involving negation, implication, and, most critically, defeasible rules and exceptions. In this paper, we propose a novel neurosymbolically-grounded architecture called LOGicalThought (LogT) that uses an advanced logical language and reasoner in conjunction with an LLM to construct a dual symbolic graph context and logic-based context. These two context representations transform the problem from inference over long-form guidelines into a compact grounded evaluation. Evaluated on four multi-domain benchmarks against four baselines, LogT improves overall performance by 11.84% across all LLMs. Performance improves significantly across all three modes of reasoning: by up to +10.2% on negation, +13.2% on implication, and +5.5% on defeasible reasoning compared to the strongest baseline.",

Our approach first trains an SAE to generate sparse vector representations for training tokens, then applies k-means clustering to construct a graph where vertices represent token clusters and weighted edges capture sequential token transitions. Using this graph, we define an edge-weight based reward function to quantify adherence to established reasoning traces, thereby identifying exploitative reasoning trajectories. Additionally, we measure generation diversity from clustering to assess the extent of exploration. Our findings indicate that balancing both exploitation and exploration is crucial for achieving high accuracy in mathematical reasoning tasks. During generation, the SAE can serve as a scalable reward model to guide generations, ensuring a balanced trade-off between exploitation and exploration. This prevents extreme behaviors in either direction, ultimately fostering a higher-quality reasoning process in LLMs.",

        "summary": "Modern deployments increasingly allocate large test-time compute (thousands of tokens or many node expansions) to boost reliability. Under such budgets, standard Tree-of-Thoughts-style search exhibits two pathologies: breadth saturation (additional samples mostly produce near-duplicates, so width stops growing) and depth myopia (noisy short-horizon utilities prune branches whose payoff appears after a few more steps). We propose Lateral Tree-of-Thoughts (LToT), a drop-in controller that separates utility from logical consistency and treats low-utility but consistent candidates as assets rather than waste. The frontier is split into mainlines (high-utility candidates used for exploitation) and laterals (consistent, initially low-utility candidates that receive short, cheap probes before judgment). LToT explores laterals via Lateral Racing with Short-Circuit (LR--SC): a capped successive-halving race that spreads tiny probes across a very wide lateral set, uses width-aware thresholds with repeat-to-confirm, and immediately promotes a branch once its envelope clears the mainline bar; mainlines are kept intentionally narrow so surplus compute is invested where width is cheap. We prove a pseudolinear lateral cost $\\Theta(N_0 \\log_{\\eta} N_0)$ with logarithmically many rungs (initial lateral width $N_0$; culling factor $\\eta>1$), in contrast to the exponential growth of uncapped mainlines. Empirical evaluations on benchmark tasks are in preparation and will be added in a future revision. In short, LToT turns large test-time budgets into principled diversity while preserving promotion discipline, mitigating saturation and myopia without inflating compute.",

We created this dataset through a two-step process: (1) by prompting an LLM with carefully structured instructions, we generated 120 technical documentation excerpts (samples), each depicting a fictional, albeit plausible, AI system - of the kind an AI provider might produce to demonstrate their compliance with AIR; (2) legal experts then reviewed and annotated each sample to indicate whether, and in what way, the AI system described therein violates specific Articles of the AIA. The resulting dataset, together with our evaluation of whether frontier LLMs can reproduce the experts' compliance labels, provides a starting point to understand the opportunities and limitations of LLM-based AIR compliance assessment tools and establishes a benchmark against which subsequent LLMs can be compared.

We introduce Falconer, a collaborative framework that combines the agentic reasoning of LLMs with lightweight proxy models for scalable knowledge mining. In Falconer, LLMs act as planners, decomposing user instructions into executable pipelines, and as annotators, generating supervision to train small proxies. The framework unifies classification and extraction into two atomic operations, get label and get span, enabling a single instruction-following model to replace multiple task-specific components. To evaluate the consistency between proxy models incubated by Falconer and annotations provided by humans and large models, we construct new benchmarks covering both planning and end-to-end execution. Experiments show that Falconer closely matches state-of-the-art LLMs in instruction-following accuracy while reducing inference cost by up to 90% and accelerating large-scale knowledge mining by more than 20x, offering an efficient and scalable foundation for Deep Research.",

OntoLogX integrates a lightweight log ontology with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and iterative correction steps, ensuring that generated KGs are syntactically and semantically valid. Beyond event-level analysis, the system aggregates KGs into sessions and employs a LLM to predict MITRE ATT&CK tactics, linking low-level log evidence to higher-level adversarial objectives. We evaluate OntoLogX on both logs from a public benchmark and a real-world honeypot dataset, demonstrating robust KG generation across multiple KGs backends and accurate mapping of adversarial activity to ATT&CK tactics.

We introduce OR-Toolformer, which fine-tunes Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct with a semi-automatic data synthesis pipeline that generates diverse OR problem-answer pairs and augments the model with external solvers to produce API calls. On three of four standard benchmarks, OR-Toolformer achieves up to 80.1% execution accuracy, exceeding size-matched baselines by over 4.3%. In zero-shot evaluation on two unseen OR problem types, it attains 54% average accuracy, a 21 percentage-point improvement over the strongest baseline.

        "summary": "Text-to-image diffusion models trained on a fixed set of resolutions often fail to generalize, even when asked to generate images at lower resolutions than those seen during training. High-resolution text-to-image generators are currently unable to easily offer an out-of-the-box budget-efficient alternative to their users who might not need high-resolution images. We identify a key technical insight in diffusion models that when addressed can help tackle this limitation: Noise schedulers have unequal perceptual effects across resolutions. The same level of noise removes disproportionately more signal from lower-resolution images than from high-resolution images, leading to a train-test mismatch. We propose NoiseShift, a training-free method that recalibrates the noise level of the denoiser conditioned on resolution size. NoiseShift requires no changes to model architecture or sampling schedule and is compatible with existing models. When applied to Stable Diffusion 3, Stable Diffusion 3.5, and Flux-Dev, quality at low resolutions is significantly improved. On LAION-COCO, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 15.89%, SD3 by 8.56%, and Flux-Dev by 2.44% in FID on average. On CelebA, NoiseShift improves SD3.5 by 10.36%, SD3 by 5.19%, and Flux-Dev by 3.02% in FID on average. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of NoiseShift in mitigating resolution-dependent artifacts and enhancing the quality of low-resolution image generation.",

However, the mechanisms underpinning these strong capabilities remain only partially understood. A leading conjecture, based on the manifold hypothesis, attributes this success to their ability to adapt to low-dimensional geometric structure within the data. This work provides evidence for this conjecture, focusing on how such phenomena could result from the formulation of the learning problem through score matching. We inspect the role of implicit regularisation by investigating the effect of smoothing minimisers of the empirical score matching objective. Our theoretical and empirical results confirm that smoothing the score function -- or equivalently, smoothing in the log-density domain -- produces smoothing tangential to the data manifold. In addition, we show that the manifold along which the diffusion model generalises can be controlled by choosing an appropriate smoothing.",

Through this approach, we can adopt an optimization-based sampling process at inference time, where samples are obtained by gradient descent on the learned landscape with adjustable step sizes, adaptive optimizers, and adaptive compute. EqM surpasses the generation performance of diffusion/flow models empirically, achieving an FID of 1.90 on ImageNet 256$\\times$256. EqM is also theoretically justified to learn and sample from the data manifold. Beyond generation, EqM is a flexible framework that naturally handles tasks including partially noised image denoising, OOD detection, and image composition. By replacing time-conditional velocities with a unified equilibrium landscape, EqM offers a tighter bridge between flow and energy-based models and a simple route to optimization-driven inference.",

Beyond their creative potential, such models also hold promise as world simulators for robotics and embodied decision making. Despite strong advances, however, current approaches still struggle to generate physically plausible object interactions and lack physics-grounded control mechanisms. To address this limitation, we introduce KineMask, an approach for physics-guided video generation that enables realistic rigid body control, interactions, and effects. Given a single image and a specified object velocity, our method generates videos with inferred motions and future object interactions. We propose a two-stage training strategy that gradually removes future motion supervision via object masks. Using this strategy we train video diffusion models (VDMs) on synthetic scenes of simple interactions and demonstrate significant improvements of object interactions in real scenes. Furthermore, KineMask integrates low-level motion control with high-level textual conditioning via predictive scene descriptions, leading to effective support for synthesis of complex dynamical phenomena. Extensive experiments show that KineMask achieves strong improvements over recent models of comparable size. Ablation studies further highlight the complementary roles of low- and high-level conditioning in VDMs. Our code, model, and data will be made publicly available.",

        "summary": "Diffusion models have revolutionized image and video generation, achieving unprecedented visual quality. However, their reliance on transformer architectures incurs prohibitively high computational costs, particularly when extending generation to long videos. Recent work has explored autoregressive formulations for long video generation, typically by distilling from short-horizon bidirectional teachers. Nevertheless, given that teacher models cannot synthesize long videos, the extrapolation of student models beyond their training horizon often leads to pronounced quality degradation, arising from the compounding of errors within the continuous latent space. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate quality degradation in long-horizon video generation without requiring supervision from long-video teachers or retraining on long video datasets. Our approach centers on exploiting the rich knowledge of teacher models to provide guidance for the student model through sampled segments drawn from self-generated long videos. Our method maintains temporal consistency while scaling video length by up to 20x beyond teacher's capability, avoiding common issues such as over-exposure and error-accumulation without recomputing overlapping frames like previous methods. When scaling up the computation, our method shows the capability of generating videos up to 4 minutes and 15 seconds, equivalent to 99.9% of the maximum span supported by our base model's position embedding and more than 50x longer than that of our baseline model. Experiments on standard benchmarks and our proposed improved benchmark demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms baseline methods in both fidelity and consistency.

Recent studies have identified a specific subset of hallucinations, known as confabulations, which arise due to predictive uncertainty of LLMs. To detect confabulations, various methods for estimating predictive uncertainty in natural language generation (NLG) have been developed. These methods are typically evaluated by correlating uncertainty estimates with the correctness of generated text, with question-answering (QA) datasets serving as the standard benchmark. However, commonly used approximate correctness functions have substantial disagreement between each other and, consequently, in the ranking of the uncertainty estimation methods. This allows one to inflate the apparent performance of uncertainty estimation methods. We propose using several alternative risk indicators for risk correlation experiments that improve robustness of empirical assessment of UE algorithms for NLG. For QA tasks, we show that marginalizing over multiple LLM-as-a-judge variants leads to reducing the evaluation biases. Furthermore, we explore structured tasks as well as out of distribution and perturbation detection tasks which provide robust and controllable risk indicators. Finally, we propose to use an Elo rating of uncertainty estimation methods to give an objective summarization over extensive evaluation settings.",

While CLIP exhibits strong zero-shot transfer, its reliance on coarse global features restricts its performance on fine-grained classification tasks. Prior efforts inject fine-grained knowledge by aligning large language model (LLM) descriptions with the CLIP $\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token; however, this approach overlooks spatial precision. We propose $\\textbf{microCLIP}$, a self-training framework that jointly refines CLIP's visual and textual representations using fine-grained cues. At its core is Saliency-Oriented Attention Pooling (SOAP) within a lightweight TokenFusion module, which builds a saliency-guided $\\texttt{[FG]}$ token from patch embeddings and fuses it with the global $\\texttt{[CLS]}$ token for coarse-fine alignment. To stabilize adaptation, we introduce a two-headed LLM-derived classifier: a frozen classifier that, via multi-view alignment, provides a stable text-based prior for pseudo-labeling, and a learnable classifier initialized from LLM descriptions and fine-tuned with TokenFusion. We further develop Dynamic Knowledge Aggregation, which convexly combines fixed LLM/CLIP priors with TokenFusion's evolving logits to iteratively refine pseudo-labels. Together, these components uncover latent fine-grained signals in CLIP, yielding a consistent $2.90\\%$ average accuracy gain across 13 fine-grained benchmarks while requiring only light adaptation.

Q-learning is employed for discrete jamming-event states, while Deep Q-Networks (DQN) are employed for continuous states based on received power.

Accurate assessment of human movement under real-world conditions is essential for telemedicine, sports science, and rehabilitation.

During this initial study only healthy subjects were recorded, so results cannot be generalized to pathological cohorts. Joint angles derived from state-of-the-art deep learning frameworks (MotionAGFormer, MotionBERT, MMPose 2D-to-3D pose lifting, and NVIDIA BodyTrack) were evaluated against joint angles computed from IMU data using OpenSim inverse kinematics following the Human3.6M dataset format with 17 keypoints. Among them, MotionAGFormer demonstrated superior performance, achieving the lowest overall RMSE ($9.27\\deg \\pm 4.80\\deg$) and MAE ($7.86\\deg \\pm 4.18\\deg$), as well as the highest Pearson correlation ($0.86 \\pm 0.15$) and the highest coefficient of determination $R^{2}$ ($0.67 \\pm 0.28$). The results reveal that both technologies are viable for out-of-the-lab kinematic assessment. However, they also highlight key trade-offs between video- and sensor-based approaches including costs, accessibility, and precision. This study clarifies where off-the-shelf video models already provide clinically promising kinematics in healthy adults and where they lag behind IMU-based estimates while establishing valuable guidelines for researchers and clinicians seeking to develop robust, cost-effective, and user-friendly solutions for telehealth and remote patient monitoring.",

        "summary": "Drag-based image editing has long suffered from distortions in the target region, largely because the priors of earlier base models, Stable Diffusion, are insufficient to project optimized latents back onto the natural image manifold. With the shift from UNet-based DDPMs to more scalable DiT with flow matching (e.g., SD3.5, FLUX), generative priors have become significantly stronger, enabling advances across diverse editing tasks. However, drag-based editing has yet to benefit from these stronger priors. This work proposes the first framework to effectively harness FLUX's rich prior for drag-based editing, dubbed DragFlow, achieving substantial gains over baselines. We first show that directly applying point-based drag editing to DiTs performs poorly: unlike the highly compressed features of UNets, DiT features are insufficiently structured to provide reliable guidance for point-wise motion supervision. To overcome this limitation, DragFlow introduces a region-based editing paradigm, where affine transformations enable richer and more consistent feature supervision. Additionally, we integrate pretrained open-domain personalization adapters (e.g., IP-Adapter) to enhance subject consistency, while preserving background fidelity through gradient mask-based hard constraints. Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are further employed to resolve task ambiguities. For evaluation, we curate a novel Region-based Dragging benchmark (ReD Bench) featuring region-level dragging instructions. Extensive experiments on DragBench-DR and ReD Bench show that DragFlow surpasses both point-based and region-based baselines, setting a new state-of-the-art in drag-based image editing.

However, standard reinforcement learning (RL) on such tasks is impeded by sparse rewards and unstable optimization. To address this, we first construct ReasonMap-Plus, an extended dataset that introduces dense reward signals through Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, enabling effective cold-start training of fine-grained visual understanding skills. Next, we propose RewardMap, a multi-stage RL framework designed to improve both visual understanding and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs. RewardMap incorporates two key designs. First, we introduce a difficulty-aware reward design that incorporates detail rewards, directly tackling the sparse rewards while providing richer supervision. Second, we propose a multi-stage RL scheme that bootstraps training from simple perception to complex reasoning tasks, offering a more effective cold-start strategy than conventional Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). Experiments on ReasonMap and ReasonMap-Plus demonstrate that each component of RewardMap contributes to consistent performance gains, while their combination yields the best results. Moreover, models trained with RewardMap achieve an average improvement of 3.47% across 6 benchmarks spanning spatial reasoning, fine-grained visual reasoning, and general tasks beyond transit maps, underscoring enhanced visual understanding and reasoning capabilities.",

This naturally motivates a more accurate and informative two-stage likelihood approximation combined with importance sampling correction, which leads to generalized RL algorithms with better sample efficiency and superior task performance. Second, we propose a new direction of joint training efficient samplers/controllers of dLLMs policy. Via RL, we incentivize dLLMs' natural multi-token prediction capabilities by letting the model learn to adaptively allocate an inference threshold for each prompt. By jointly training the sampler, we yield better accuracies with lower number of function evaluations (NFEs) compared to training the model only, obtaining the best performance in improving the Pareto frontier of the inference-time compute of dLLMs. We showcase the effectiveness of our pipeline by training open source large diffusion language models over benchmark math and planning tasks.",

        "summary": "Objective: Chagas disease is a parasitic infection that is endemic to South America, Central America, and, more recently, the U.S., primarily transmitted by insects. Chronic Chagas disease can cause cardiovascular diseases and digestive problems. Serological testing capacities for Chagas disease are limited, but Chagas cardiomyopathy often manifests in ECGs, providing an opportunity to prioritize patients for testing and treatment. Approach: The George B. Moody PhysioNet Challenge 2025 invites teams to develop algorithmic approaches for identifying Chagas disease from electrocardiograms (ECGs). Main results: This Challenge provides multiple innovations. First, we leveraged several datasets with labels from patient reports and serological testing, provided a large dataset with weak labels and smaller datasets with strong labels. Second, we augmented the data to support model robustness and generalizability to unseen data sources. Third, we applied an evaluation metric that captured the local serological testing capacity for Chagas disease to frame the machine learning problem as a triage task. Significance: Over 630 participants from 111 teams submitted over 1300 entries during the Challenge, representing diverse approaches from academia and industry worldwide.",

Existing personalization approaches typically require extensive pre-recorded data and place the burden of adaptation on the DHH speaker. We present EvolveCaptions, a real-time, collaborative ASR adaptation system that supports in-situ personalization with minimal effort. Hearing participants correct ASR errors during live conversations. Based on these corrections, the system generates short, phonetically targeted prompts for the DHH speaker to record, which are then used to fine-tune the ASR model. In a study with 12 DHH and six hearing participants, EvolveCaptions reduced Word Error Rate (WER) across all DHH users within one hour of use, using only five minutes of recording time on average. Participants described the system as intuitive, low-effort, and well-integrated into communication. These findings demonstrate the promise of collaborative, real-time ASR adaptation for more equitable communication.",

In this work, we introduce GRACE (Generating Rewards As CodE), a method for using Large Language Models within an evolutionary search to reverse-engineer an interpretable, code-based reward function directly from expert trajectories. The resulting reward function is executable code that can be inspected and verified. We empirically validate GRACE on the BabyAI and AndroidWorld benchmarks, where it efficiently learns highly accurate rewards, even in complex, multi-task settings. Further, we demonstrate that the resulting reward leads to strong policies, compared to both competitive Imitation Learning and online RL approaches with ground-truth rewards.

Machines cannot perform music in the human sense; they can produce, reproduce, execute, or synthesize music, but they lack the capacity for affective or emotional experience. As such, music performance is an ideal candidate through which to explore aspects of collaboration between humans and machines. In this paper, we introduce the witheFlow system, designed to enhance real-time music performance by automatically modulating audio effects based on features extracted from both biosignals and the audio itself.

We present a theoretical and empirical comparison of these losses, focusing on intra- and inter-class variance and optimization behavior (e.g., greedy updates). Through task-specific experiments with consistent settings on synthetic data and real datasets-MNIST, CIFAR-10-it is shown that triplet loss preserves greater variance within and across classes, supporting finer-grained distinctions in the learned representations. In contrast, contrastive loss tends to compact intra-class embeddings, which may obscure subtle semantic differences. To better understand their optimization dynamics, By examining loss-decay rate, active ratio, and gradient norm, we find that contrastive loss drives many small updates early on, while triplet loss produces fewer but stronger updates that sustain learning on hard examples. Finally, across both classification and retrieval tasks on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CUB-200, and CARS196 datasets, our results consistently show that triplet loss yields superior performance, which suggests using triplet loss for detail retention and hard-sample focus, and contrastive loss for smoother, broad-based embedding refinement.",

We propose ASK-Hint, a structured prompting framework that leverages action-centric knowledge to elicit more accurate and interpretable reasoning from frozen VLMs. Our approach organizes prompts into semantically coherent groups (e.g. violence, property crimes, public safety) and formulates fine-grained guiding questions that align model predictions with discriminative visual cues. Extensive experiments on UCF-Crime and XD-Violence show that ASK-Hint consistently improves AUC over prior baselines, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to both fine-tuned and training-free methods. Beyond accuracy, our framework provides interpretable reasoning traces towards anomaly and demonstrates strong generalization across datasets and VLM backbones. These results highlight the critical role of prompt granularity and establish ASK-Hint as a new training-free and generalizable solution for explainable video anomaly detection.",

To address this gap, this study employs a multiphase mixed methods design integrating a behavioral experiment (N = 334), thematic analysis, and follow-up quantitative testing. Findings suggest that people tend to rely on RAs, with reliance shaped by information about RA performance and the framing of advice as gains or losses. Thematic analysis reveals three RA roles in decision-making and four user types, each reflecting distinct patterns of advice integration. In addition, a 2 x 2 typology categorizes antecedents of acceptance into enablers and inhibitors at both the individual and algorithmic levels. By combining behavioral, interpretive, and confirmatory evidence, this study advances understanding of human-RA collaboration and provides actionable insights for designing more trustworthy and adaptive RA systems.",

This task is especially critical in fast-moving fields such as artificial intelligence (AI), yet it has become increasingly difficult given the rapid growth of submissions. In this paper, we investigate an underexplored measure for identifying high-impact research: authors' own rankings of their multiple submissions to the same AI conference. Grounded in game-theoretic reasoning, we hypothesize that self-rankings are informative because authors possess unique understanding of their work's conceptual depth and long-term promise. To test this hypothesis, we conducted a large-scale experiment at a leading AI conference, where 1,342 researchers self-ranked their 2,592 submissions by perceived quality. Tracking outcomes over more than a year, we found that papers ranked highest by their authors received twice as many citations as their lowest-ranked counterparts; self-rankings were especially effective at identifying highly cited papers (those with over 150 citations). Moreover, we showed that self-rankings outperformed peer review scores in predicting future citation counts. Our results remained robust after accounting for confounders such as preprint posting time and self-citations. Together, these findings demonstrate that authors' self-rankings provide a reliable and valuable complement to peer review for identifying and elevating high-impact research in AI.",

Here, by considering functional inter-individual variability as meaningful data rather than noise, we introduce VarCoNet, an enhanced self-supervised framework for robust functional connectome (FC) extraction from resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) data. VarCoNet employs self-supervised contrastive learning to exploit inherent functional inter-individual variability, serving as a brain function encoder that generates FC embeddings readily applicable to downstream tasks even in the absence of labeled data. Contrastive learning is facilitated by a novel augmentation strategy based on segmenting rs-fMRI signals. At its core, VarCoNet integrates a 1D-CNN-Transformer encoder for advanced time-series processing, enhanced with a robust Bayesian hyperparameter optimization. Our VarCoNet framework is evaluated on two downstream tasks: (i) subject fingerprinting, using rs-fMRI data from the Human Connectome Project, and (ii) autism spectrum disorder (ASD) classification, using rs-fMRI data from the ABIDE I and ABIDE II datasets. Using different brain parcellations, our extensive testing against state-of-the-art methods, including 13 deep learning methods, demonstrates VarCoNet's superiority, robustness, interpretability, and generalizability. Overall, VarCoNet provides a versatile and robust framework for FC analysis in rs-fMRI.",

Existing medical imaging datasets are not designed to systematically study this issue, largely due to restrictive licensing and limited supplementary patient data. To address this gap, we introduce SpurBreast, a curated breast MRI dataset that intentionally incorporates spurious correlations to evaluate their impact on model performance. Analyzing over 100 features involving patient, device, and imaging protocol, we identify two dominant spurious signals: magnetic field strength (a global feature influencing the entire image) and image orientation (a local feature affecting spatial alignment). Through controlled dataset splits, we demonstrate that DNNs can exploit these non-clinical signals, achieving high validation accuracy while failing to generalize to unbiased test data. Alongside these two datasets containing spurious correlations, we also provide benchmark datasets without spurious correlations, allowing researchers to systematically investigate clinically relevant and irrelevant features, uncertainty estimation, adversarial robustness, and generalization strategies.

This paper addresses this challenge with an end-to-end deep learning (DL) framework with low inference complexity that leverages the structure of the optimal SLP solution in the closed-form and its inherent tensor equivariance (TE), where TE denotes that a permutation of the input induces the corresponding permutation of the output. Building upon the computationally efficient model-based formulations, as well as their known closed-form solutions, we analyze their relationship with linear precoding (LP) and investigate the corresponding optimality condition. We then construct a mapping from the problem formulation to the solution and prove its TE, based on which the designed networks reveal a specific parameter-sharing pattern that delivers low computational complexity and strong generalization. Leveraging these, we propose the backbone of the framework with an attention-based TE module, achieving linear computational complexity. Furthermore, we demonstrate that such a framework is also applicable to imperfect CSI scenarios, where we design a TE-based network to map the CSI, statistics, and symbols to auxiliary variables. Simulation results show that the proposed framework captures substantial performance gains of optimal SLP, while achieving an approximately 80-times speedup over conventional methods and maintaining strong generalization across user numbers and symbol block lengths.",

Inspired by bug bounties, bias bounties have been proposed as a reward-based method that involves communities in AI bias detection by asking users of AI systems to report biases they encounter when interacting with such systems. In the absence of a state-of-the-art review, this survey aimed to identify and analyse existing AI bias bounty programmes and to present academic literature on bias bounties. Google, Google Scholar, PhilPapers, and IEEE Xplore were searched, and five bias bounty programmes, as well as five research publications, were identified. All bias bounties were organised by U.S.-based organisations as time-limited contests, with public participation in four programmes and prize pools ranging from 7,000 to 24,000 USD. The five research publications included a report on the application of bug bounties to algorithmic harms, an article addressing Twitter's bias bounty, a proposal for bias bounties as an institutional mechanism to increase AI scrutiny, a workshop discussing bias bounties from queer perspectives, and an algorithmic framework for bias bounties. We argue that reducing the technical requirements to enter bounty programmes is important to include those without coding experience. Given the limited adoption of bias bounties, future efforts should explore the transferability of the best practices from bug bounties and examine how such programmes can be designed to be sensitive to underrepresented groups while lowering adoption barriers for organisations.",

A 10-step process was implemented for 22 cases of jaw cysts, including image input and analysis, structured data generation, tooth number extraction and consistency checking, iterative regeneration when inconsistencies were detected, and finding generation with subsequent restructuring and consistency verification. A comparative experiment was conducted using the conventional Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method across seven evaluation items: transparency, internal structure, borders, root resorption, tooth movement, relationships with other structures, and tooth number. The results showed that the proposed SLSO framework improved output accuracy for many items, with 66.9%, 33.3%, and 28.6% improvement rates for tooth number, tooth movement, and root resorption, respectively. In the successful cases, a consistently structured output was achieved after up to five regenerations. Although statistical significance was not reached because of the small size of the dataset, the overall SLSO framework enforced negative finding descriptions, suppressed hallucinations, and improved tooth number identification accuracy. However, the accurate identification of extensive lesions spanning multiple teeth is limited. Nevertheless, further refinement is required to enhance overall performance and move toward a practical finding generation system.",

        "summary": "Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled promising performance in unit test generation through in-context learning (ICL). However, the quality of in-context examples significantly influences the effectiveness of generated tests-poorly structured or semantically unclear test examples often lead to suboptimal outputs. In this paper, we propose CLAST, a novel technique that systematically refines unit tests to improve their semantic clarity, thereby enhancing their utility as in-context examples. The approach decomposes complex tests into logically clearer ones and improves semantic clarity through a combination of program analysis and LLM-based rewriting. We evaluated CLAST on four open-source and three industrial projects. The results demonstrate that CLAST largely outperforms UTgen, the state-of-the-art refinement technique, in both preserving test effectiveness and enhancing semantic clarity. Specifically, CLAST fully retains the original effectiveness of unit tests, while UTgen reduces compilation success rate (CSR), pass rate (PR), test coverage (Cov), and mutation score (MS) by an average of 12.90%, 35.82%, 4.65%, and 5.07%, respectively. Over 85.33% of participants in our user study preferred the semantic clarity of CLAST-refined tests. Notably, incorporating CLAST-refined tests as examples effectively improves ICL-based unit test generation approaches such as RAGGen and TELPA, resulting in an average increase of 25.97% in CSR, 28.22% in PR, and 45.99% in Cov for generated tests, compared to incorporating UTgen-refined tests. The insights from the follow-up user study not only reinforce CLAST's potential impact in software testing practice but also illuminate avenues for future research.",

We are the first to introduce ZK-WAGON, a novel system for watermarking image generation models using the Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non Interactive Argument of Knowledge (ZK-SNARKs). Our approach enables verifiable proof of origin without exposing model weights, generation prompts, or any sensitive internal information. We propose Selective Layer ZK-Circuit Creation (SL-ZKCC), a method to selectively convert key layers of an image generation model into a circuit, reducing proof generation time significantly. Generated ZK-SNARK proofs are imperceptibly embedded into a generated image via Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography. We demonstrate this system on both GAN and Diffusion models, providing a secure, model-agnostic pipeline for trustworthy AI image generation.",

We observe that the anomaly amount in an image directly correlates with the difference in the learnt embeddings and utilize this to design a few-shot anomaly detector termed FoundAD. This is done by learning a nonlinear projection operator onto the natural image manifold. The simple operator acts as an effective tool for anomaly detection to characterize and identify out-of-distribution regions in an image. Extensive experiments show that our approach supports multi-class detection and achieves competitive performance while using substantially fewer parameters than prior methods. Backed up by evaluations with multiple foundation encoders, including fresh DINOv3, we believe this idea broadens the perspective on foundation features and advances the field of few-shot anomaly detection.",

The two most common defect categories of DIP are examined: (1) surface defects, and (2) pin-leg defects. However, the lack of defective component images leads to a challenge for detection tasks. To solve this problem, the ConSinGAN is used to generate a suitable-sized dataset for training and testing. Four varieties of the YOLO model are investigated (v3, v4, v7, and v9), both in isolation and with the ConSinGAN augmentation. The proposed YOLOv7 with ConSinGAN is superior to the other YOLO versions in accuracy of 95.50\\%, detection time of 285 ms, and is far superior to threshold-based approaches. In addition, the supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) system is developed, and the associated sensor architecture is described.

Yet in real-world scenarios, such graphs exhibit deficiencies that substantially undermine GNN performance. While prior GNN-based augmentation studies have explored robustness against individual imperfections, a systematic understanding of how graph-native and Large Language Models (LLMs) enhanced methods behave under compound deficiencies is still missing. Specifically, there has been no comprehensive investigation comparing conventional approaches and recent LLM-on-graph frameworks, leaving their merits unclear. To fill this gap, we conduct the first empirical study that benchmarks these two lines of methods across diverse graph deficiencies, revealing overlooked vulnerabilities and challenging the assumption that LLM augmentation is consistently superior. Building on empirical findings, we propose Robust Graph Learning via Retrieval-Augmented Contrastive Refinement (RoGRAD) framework. Unlike prior one-shot LLM-as-Enhancer designs, RoGRAD is the first iterative paradigm that leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to inject retrieval-grounded augmentations by supplying class-consistent, diverse augmentations and enforcing discriminative representations through iterative graph contrastive learning. It transforms LLM augmentation for graphs from static signal injection into dynamic refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate RoGRAD's superiority over both conventional GNN- and LLM-enhanced baselines, achieving up to 82.43% average improvement.",

        "summary": "Personalized Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) are starting to be introduced in many commercial immersive audio applications and are crucial for realistic spatial audio rendering. However, one of the main hesitations regarding their introduction is that creating personalized HRTFs is impractical at scale due to the complexities of the HRTF measurement process. To mitigate this drawback, HRTF spatial upsampling has been proposed with the aim of reducing measurements required. While prior work has seen success with different machine learning (ML) approaches, these models often struggle with long-range spatial consistency and generalization at high upsampling factors. In this paper, we propose a novel transformer-based architecture for HRTF upsampling, leveraging the attention mechanism to better capture spatial correlations across the HRTF sphere. Working in the spherical harmonic (SH) domain, our model learns to reconstruct high-resolution HRTFs from sparse input measurements with significantly improved accuracy. To enhance spatial coherence, we introduce a neighbor dissimilarity loss that promotes magnitude smoothness, yielding more realistic upsampling. We evaluate our method using both perceptual localization models and objective spectral distortion metrics. Experiments show that our model surpasses leading methods by a substantial margin in generating realistic, high-fidelity HRTFs.",

In response, a new trend in green AI is emerging, shifting from the \"bigger is better\" paradigm, which prioritizes large models, to \"small is sufficient\", emphasizing energy sobriety through smaller, more efficient models. We explore how the AI community can adopt energy sobriety today by focusing on model selection during inference. Model selection consists of choosing the most appropriate model for a given task, a simple and readily applicable method, unlike approaches requiring new hardware or architectures. Our hypothesis is that, as in many industrial activities, marginal utility gains decrease with increasing model size. Thus, applying model selection can significantly reduce energy consumption while maintaining good utility for AI inference. We conduct a systematic study of AI tasks, analyzing their popularity, model size, and efficiency. We examine how the maturity of different tasks and model adoption patterns impact the achievable energy savings, ranging from 1% to 98% for different tasks. Our estimates indicate that applying model selection could reduce AI energy consumption by 27.8%, saving 31.9 TWh worldwide in 2025 - equivalent to the annual output of five nuclear power reactors.",

The Modular Consciousness Theory (MCT) proposes a biologically grounded and computationally explicit framework in which consciousness is a discrete sequence of Integrated Informational States (IISs). Each IIS is a packet of integrated information tagged with a multidimensional density vector that quantifies informational richness. Its magnitude correlates with subjective intensity, shaping memory, behavior, and continuity of experience. Inputs from body and environment are adaptively filtered, processed by modules (abstraction, narration, evaluation, self-evaluation), and integrated into an IIS. The resulting packet, tagged with its density vector, is transmitted to behavioral readiness, memory, and decision-making modules, closing the loop. This explains why strongly tagged states exert greater influence on long-term memory and action. Unlike Global Workspace Theory, Integrated Information Theory, or Higher-Order Thought, MCT specifies a full computational pipeline producing discrete informational units with quantifiable internal structure. Subjectivity is reframed as a correlate of the density-tagging signal with functional consequences. MCT generates testable predictions, such as stress enhancing memory encoding, and provides a naturalistic blueprint for both biological and artificial architectures. Consciousness, in this view, is not an irreducible essence but an evolvable, quantifiable, and constructible feature of complex information processing.",

However, existing mathematical noise generative models capture only some of the characteristics of additive noise. Therefore, we propose a generative adversarial network (GAN), called the noise-generation GAN (NGGAN), that learns the complicated characteristics of practically measured noise samples for data augmentation. To closely match the statistics of complicated noise in NB-PLC systems, we measured the NB-PLC noise via the analog coupling and bandpass filtering circuits of a commercial NB-PLC modem to build a realistic dataset. Specifically, the NGGAN design approaches based on the practically measured dataset are as follows: (i) we design the length of input signals that the NGGAN model can fit to facilitate cyclo-stationary noise generation. (ii) Wasserstein distance is used as a loss function to enhance the similarity between the generated noise and the training dataset and ensure that the sample diversity is sufficient for various applications. (iii) To measure the similarity performance of the GAN-based models based on mathematical and practically measured datasets, we perform quantitative and qualitative analyses. The training datasets include (1) a piecewise spectral cyclo-stationary Gaussian model (PSCGM), (2) a frequency-shift (FRESH) filter, and (3) practical measurements from NB-PLC systems.

We challenge this convention by proposing wide-narrow-wide (Hourglass) MLP blocks where skip connections operate at expanded dimensions while residual computation flows through narrow bottlenecks. This inversion leverages higher-dimensional spaces for incremental refinement while maintaining computational efficiency through parameter-matched designs. Implementing Hourglass MLPs requires an initial projection to lift input signals to expanded dimensions. We propose that this projection can remain fixed at random initialization throughout training, enabling efficient training and inference implementations. We evaluate both architectures on generative tasks over popular image datasets, characterizing performance-parameter Pareto frontiers through systematic architectural search. Results show that Hourglass architectures consistently achieve superior Pareto frontiers compared to conventional designs. As parameter budgets increase, optimal Hourglass configurations favor deeper networks with wider skip connections and narrower bottlenecks-a scaling pattern distinct from conventional MLPs. Our findings suggest reconsidering skip connection placement in modern architectures, with potential applications extending to Transformers and other residual networks.",

        "summary": "Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly applied in autonomous driving for unified perception and reasoning, but high inference latency hinders real-time deployment. Early-exit reduces latency by terminating inference at intermediate layers, yet its task-dependent nature limits generalization across diverse scenarios. We observe that this limitation aligns with autonomous driving: navigation systems can anticipate upcoming contexts (e.g., intersections, traffic lights), indicating which tasks will be required. We propose Nav-EE, a navigation-guided early-exit framework that precomputes task-specific exit layers offline and dynamically applies them online based on navigation priors. Experiments on CODA, Waymo, and BOSCH show that Nav-EE achieves accuracy comparable to full inference while reducing latency by up to 63.9%. Real-vehicle integration with Autoware Universe further demonstrates reduced inference latency (600ms to 300ms), supporting faster decision-making in complex scenarios. These results suggest that coupling navigation foresight with early-exit offers a viable path toward efficient deployment of large models in autonomous systems.

By utilizing multimodal sensing, the UAVs overcome the limitations of unimodal systems, enhancing model accuracy, generalization, and offering a more comprehensive understanding of the environment. The primary objective is to optimize FML system latency in UAV networks by jointly addressing UAV sensing scheduling, power control, trajectory planning, resource allocation, and BS resource management. To address the computational complexity of our latency minimization problem, we propose an efficient iterative optimization algorithm combining block coordinate descent and successive convex approximation techniques, which provides high-quality approximate solutions. We also present a theoretical convergence analysis for the UAV-assisted FML framework under a non-convex loss function.

These biases lead to nontrivial discrepancies both across simulators and between simulation and the real world. To mitigate the effect of simulator inductive bias, the key idea is to train policies jointly across multiple simulators, encouraging the learned controller to capture dynamics that generalize beyond any single simulator's assumptions. We thus introduce PolySim, a WBC training platform that integrates multiple heterogeneous simulators. PolySim can launch parallel environments from different engines simultaneously within a single training run, thereby realizing dynamics-level domain randomization. Theoretically, we show that PolySim yields a tighter upper bound on simulator inductive bias than single-simulator training. In experiments, PolySim substantially reduces motion-tracking error in sim-to-sim evaluations; for example, on MuJoCo, it improves execution success by 52.8 over an IsaacSim baseline. PolySim further enables zero-shot deployment on a real Unitree G1 without additional fine-tuning, showing effective transfer from simulation to the real world. We will release the PolySim code upon acceptance of this work.",

These limitations arise from ignoring global activation structure and restricting mappings to rigid one-to-one layer correspondences. We propose Hierarchical Optimal Transport (HOT), a unified framework that jointly infers soft, globally consistent layer-to-layer couplings and neuron-level transport plans. HOT allows source neurons to distribute mass across multiple target layers while minimizing total transport cost under marginal constraints. This yields both a single alignment score for the entire network comparison and a soft transport plan that naturally handles depth mismatches through mass distribution. We evaluate HOT on vision models, large language models, and human visual cortex recordings. Across all domains, HOT matches or surpasses standard pairwise matching in alignment quality. Moreover, it reveals smooth, fine-grained hierarchical correspondences: early layers map to early layers, deeper layers maintain relative positions, and depth mismatches are resolved by distributing representations across multiple layers. These structured patterns emerge naturally from global optimization without being imposed, yet are absent in greedy layer-wise methods. HOT thus enables richer, more interpretable comparisons between representations, particularly when networks differ in architecture or depth.",

Recent work has shown promise by incorporating pixel-level visual information into the reasoning process, enabling VLMs to access high-resolution visual details during their thought process. However, this pixel-level information is often overused, leading to inefficiency and distraction from irrelevant visual details. To address these challenges, we propose the first framework for adaptive pixel reasoning that dynamically determines necessary pixel-level operations based on the input query. Specifically, we first apply operation-aware supervised fine-tuning to establish baseline competence in textual reasoning and visual operations, then design a novel rollout-guided reinforcement learning framework relying on feedback of the model's own responses, which enables the VLM to determine when pixel operations should be invoked based on query difficulty. Experiments on extensive multimodal reasoning benchmarks show that our model achieves superior performance while significantly reducing unnecessary visual operations. Impressively, our model achieves 73.4\\% accuracy on HR-Bench 4K while maintaining a tool usage ratio of only 20.1\\%, improving accuracy and simultaneously reducing tool usage by 66.5\\% compared to the previous methods.",

Next, we integrate a temperature scheduler within the vanilla contrastive loss to balance the uniformity and tolerance characteristics of the embeddings. Additionally, a hierarchical angular margin loss enforces instance-wise and temporal contrast losses, creating geometric margins between positive and negative pairs of temporal sequences. This approach improves the coherence of positive pairs and their separation from the negatives, enhancing the capture of temporal dependencies within a time-series sample. We evaluate our approach on a wide range of tasks, namely 128 UCR and 30 UAE datasets for univariate and multivariate classification, as well as Yahoo and KPI datasets for anomaly detection.

This shift is largely pragmatic: conventional value functions are computationally expensive to train at LLM scale and often fail under sparse rewards and long reasoning horizons. We revisit this bottleneck from an architectural perspective and introduce Asymmetric Proximal Policy Optimization (AsyPPO), a simple and scalable framework that restores the critics role while remaining efficient in large-model settings. AsyPPO employs a set of lightweight mini-critics, each trained on disjoint prompt shards. This design encourages diversity while preserving calibration, reducing value-estimation bias. Beyond robust estimation, AsyPPO leverages inter-critic uncertainty to refine the policy update: (i) masking advantages in states where critics agree and gradients add little learning signal, and (ii) filtering high-divergence states from entropy regularization, suppressing spurious exploration. After training on open-source data with only 5,000 samples, AsyPPO consistently improves learning stability and performance across multiple benchmarks over strong baselines, such as GRPO, achieving performance gains of more than six percent on Qwen3-4b-Base and about three percent on Qwen3-8b-Base and Qwen3-14b-Base over classic PPO, without additional tricks.

Despite its promise, however, progress in this area has diminished, as conventional methods are seemingly unable to surpass moderate sparsity levels (50-60%) without severely degrading model accuracy. This work breaks through the current impasse, presenting a principled and effective method called $\\texttt{Elsa}$, which achieves extreme sparsity levels of up to 90% while retaining high model fidelity. This is done by identifying several limitations in current practice, all of which can be traced back to their reliance on a surrogate objective formulation. $\\texttt{Elsa}$ tackles this issue directly and effectively via standard and well-established constrained optimization techniques based on ADMM. Our extensive experiments across a wide range of models and scales show that $\\texttt{Elsa}$ achieves substantial improvements over existing methods; e.g., it achieves 7.8$\\times$ less perplexity than the best existing method on LLaMA-2-7B at 90% sparsity. Furthermore, we present $\\texttt{Elsa}_{\\text{-L}}$, a quantized variant that scales to extremely large models (27B), and establish its theoretical convergence guarantees.

This paper goes one step ahead with the problem of source-free cross-domain continual learning where the use of source-domain samples are completely prohibited. We propose the idea of rehearsal-free frequency-aware dynamic prompt collaborations (REFEREE) to cope with the absence of labeled source-domain samples in realm of cross-domain continual learning. REFEREE is built upon a synergy between a source-pre-trained model and a large-scale vision-language model, thus overcoming the problem of sub-optimal generalizations when relying only on a source pre-trained model. The domain shift problem between the source domain and the target domain is handled by a frequency-aware prompting technique encouraging low-frequency components while suppressing high-frequency components. This strategy generates frequency-aware augmented samples, robust against noisy pseudo labels. The noisy pseudo-label problem is further addressed with the uncertainty-aware weighting strategy where the mean and covariance matrix are weighted by prediction uncertainties, thus mitigating the adverse effects of the noisy pseudo label.

Our rigorous numerical studies confirm the advantage of our approach where it beats prior arts having access to source domain samples with significant margins.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models are profoundly changing work patterns in high-risk professional domains, yet their application also introduces severe and underexplored compliance risks. To investigate this issue, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 highly-skilled knowledge workers from industries such as law, healthcare, and finance. The study found that these experts are commonly concerned about sensitive information leakage, intellectual property infringement, and uncertainty regarding the quality of model outputs. In response, they spontaneously adopt various mitigation strategies, such as actively distorting input data and limiting the details in their prompts. However, the effectiveness of these spontaneous efforts is limited due to a lack of specific compliance guidance and training for Large Language Models. Our research reveals a significant gap between current NLP tools and the actual compliance needs of experts. This paper positions these valuable empirical findings as foundational work for building the next generation of Human-Centered, Compliance-Driven Natural Language Processing for Regulatory Technology (RegTech), providing a critical human-centered perspective and design requirements for engineering NLP systems that can proactively support expert compliance workflows.",

PD telemonitoring emerges as a novel assessment modality enabling self-administered at-home tests of Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores, enhancing accessibility for PD patients.

To address these challenges, NoRo, a noise-robust UPDRS prediction framework is proposed. First, the original speech features are grouped into ordered bins, based on the continuous values of a selected feature, to construct contrastive pairs. Second, the contrastive pairs are employed to train a multilayer perceptron encoder for generating noise-robust features. Finally, these features are concatenated with the original features as the augmented features, which are then fed into the UPDRS prediction models. Notably, we further introduces a novel evaluation approach with customizable noise injection module, and extensive experiments show that NoRo can successfully enhance the noise robustness of UPDRS prediction across various downstream prediction models under different noisy environments.",

In parallel, reinforcement learning (RL) has broadened exploration and enabled precise multi-objective optimization in protein design. Yet whether RL can push PLMs beyond their pretraining priors to uncover latent sequence-structure-function rules remains unclear. We address this by pairing RL with PLMs across four domains: antimicrobial peptide design, kinase variant optimization, antibody engineering, and inverse folding. Using diverse RL algorithms and model classes, we ask if RL improves sampling efficiency and, more importantly, if it reveals capabilities not captured by supervised learning. Across benchmarks, RL consistently boosts success rates and sample efficiency. Performance follows a three-factor interaction: task headroom, reward fidelity, and policy capacity jointly determine gains. When rewards are accurate and informative, policies have sufficient capacity, and tasks leave room beyond supervised baselines, improvements scale; when rewards are noisy or capacity is constrained, gains saturate despite exploration. This view yields practical guidance for RL in protein design: prioritize reward modeling and calibration before scaling policy size, match algorithm and regularization strength to task difficulty, and allocate capacity where marginal gains are largest.

        "summary": "Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages a Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence loss to stabilize training and prevent overfitting. However, in methods such as GRPO, its implementation may be guided by principles from numerical value estimation-a practice that overlooks the term's functional role as an optimization loss. To analyze this issue, we establish a unified framework that connects two seemingly distinct implementation styles: using the mathematical term $k_n$ as a detached coefficient for the policy's score function ('$k_n$ in reward') or as a direct loss function through which gradients are propagated ('$k_n$ as loss'). We show that the latter can always be analyzed via an equivalent gradient coefficient in the former, unifying the two perspectives. Through this framework, we prove that the conventional '$k_1$ in reward' (like in PPO) is the principled loss for Reverse KL (RKL) regularization. We further establish a key finding: under on-policy conditions, the '$k_2$ as loss' formulation is, in fact, gradient-equivalent to '$k_1$ in reward'. This equivalence, first proven in our work, identifies both as the theoretically sound implementations of the RKL objective. In contrast, we show that the recently adopted '$k_3$ as loss' (like in GRPO) is merely a first-order, biased approximation of the principled loss. Furthermore, we argue that common off-policy implementations of '$k_n$ as loss' methods are biased due to neglected importance sampling, and we propose a principled correction. Our findings provide a comprehensive, gradient-based rationale for choosing and correctly implementing KL regularization, paving the way for more robust and effective RLHF systems.",

In this paper, we investigate the intrinsic vulnerabilities of LLMs in CTI, focusing on challenges that arise from the nature of the threat landscape itself rather than the model architecture. Using large-scale evaluations across multiple CTI benchmarks and real-world threat reports, we introduce a novel categorization methodology that integrates stratification, autoregressive refinement, and human-in-the-loop supervision to reliably analyze failure instances. Through extensive experiments and human inspections, we reveal three fundamental vulnerabilities: spurious correlations, contradictory knowledge, and constrained generalization, that limit LLMs in effectively supporting CTI. Subsequently, we provide actionable insights for designing more robust LLM-powered CTI systems to facilitate future research.",

        "summary": "Learning from human involvement aims to incorporate the human subject to monitor and correct agent behavior errors. Although most interactive imitation learning methods focus on correcting the agent's action at the current state, they do not adjust its actions in future states, which may be potentially more hazardous. To address this, we introduce Predictive Preference Learning from Human Interventions (PPL), which leverages the implicit preference signals contained in human interventions to inform predictions of future rollouts. The key idea of PPL is to bootstrap each human intervention into L future time steps, called the preference horizon, with the assumption that the agent follows the same action and the human makes the same intervention in the preference horizon. By applying preference optimization on these future states, expert corrections are propagated into the safety-critical regions where the agent is expected to explore, significantly improving learning efficiency and reducing human demonstrations needed. We evaluate our approach with experiments on both autonomous driving and robotic manipulation benchmarks and demonstrate its efficiency and generality. Our theoretical analysis further shows that selecting an appropriate preference horizon L balances coverage of risky states with label correctness, thereby bounding the algorithmic optimality gap.

We introduce WALT (Web Agents that Learn Tools), a framework that reverse-engineers latent website functionality into reusable invocable tools. Rather than hypothesizing ad-hoc skills, WALT exposes robust implementations of automations already designed into websites -- spanning discovery (search, filter, sort), communication (post, comment, upvote), and content management (create, edit, delete). Tools abstract away low-level execution: instead of reasoning about how to click and type, agents simply call search(query) or create(listing). This shifts the computational burden from fragile step-by-step reasoning to reliable tool invocation.

Adverse events (AEs) may signal unexpected pharmacokinetic or toxicokinetic effects, increasing the risk of violative residues in the food chain. This study introduces a predictive framework for classifying outcomes (Death vs. Recovery) using ~1.28 million reports (1987-2025 Q1) from the U.S. FDA's OpenFDA Center for Veterinary Medicine. A preprocessing pipeline merged relational tables and standardized AEs through VeDDRA ontologies. Data were normalized, missing values imputed, and high-cardinality features reduced; physicochemical drug properties were integrated to capture chemical-residue links. We evaluated supervised models, including Random Forest, CatBoost, XGBoost, ExcelFormer, and large language models (Gemma 3-27B, Phi 3-12B). Class imbalance was addressed, such as undersampling and oversampling, with a focus on prioritizing recall for fatal outcomes. Ensemble methods(Voting, Stacking) and CatBoost performed best, achieving precision, recall, and F1-scores of 0.95. Incorporating Average Uncertainty Margin (AUM)-based pseudo-labeling of uncertain cases improved minority-class detection, particularly in ExcelFormer and XGBoost. Interpretability via SHAP identified biologically plausible predictors, including lung, heart, and bronchial disorders, animal demographics, and drug physicochemical properties. These features were strongly linked to fatal outcomes. Overall, the framework shows that combining rigorous data engineering, advanced machine learning, and explainable AI enables accurate, interpretable predictions of veterinary safety outcomes. The approach supports FARAD's mission by enabling early detection of high-risk drug-event profiles, strengthening residue risk assessment, and informing regulatory and clinical decision-making.",

        "summary": "While contrast-enhanced CT (CECT) is standard for assessing abdominal aortic aneurysms (AAA), the required iodinated contrast agents pose significant risks, including nephrotoxicity, patient allergies, and environmental harm. To reduce contrast agent use, recent deep learning methods have focused on generating synthetic CECT from non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans. However, most adopt a multi-stage pipeline that first generates images and then performs segmentation, which leads to error accumulation and fails to leverage shared semantic and anatomical structures. To address this, we propose a unified deep learning framework that generates synthetic CECT images from NCCT scans while simultaneously segmenting the aortic lumen and thrombus. Our approach integrates conditional diffusion models (CDM) with multi-task learning, enabling end-to-end joint optimization of image synthesis and anatomical segmentation. Unlike previous multitask diffusion models, our approach requires no initial predictions (e.g., a coarse segmentation mask), shares both encoder and decoder parameters across tasks, and employs a semi-supervised training strategy to learn from scans with missing segmentation labels, a common constraint in real-world clinical data. We evaluated our method on a cohort of 264 patients, where it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art single-task and multi-stage models. For image synthesis, our model achieved a PSNR of 25.61 dB, compared to 23.80 dB from a single-task CDM. For anatomical segmentation, it improved the lumen Dice score to 0.89 from 0.87 and the challenging thrombus Dice score to 0.53 from 0.48 (nnU-Net). These segmentation enhancements led to more accurate clinical measurements, reducing the lumen diameter MAE to 4.19 mm from 5.78 mm and the thrombus area error to 33.85% from 41.45% when compared to nnU-Net.

However, a pair of recent studies reported being unable to successfully transfer image jailbreaks between vision-language models (VLMs). To explain this striking difference, we propose a fundamental distinction regarding the transferability of attacks against machine learning models: attacks in the input data-space can transfer, whereas attacks in model representation space do not, at least not without geometric alignment of representations. We then provide theoretical and empirical evidence of this hypothesis in four different settings. First, we mathematically prove this distinction in a simple setting where two networks compute the same input-output map but via different representations. Second, we construct representation-space attacks against image classifiers that are as successful as well-known data-space attacks, but fail to transfer. Third, we construct representation-space attacks against LMs that successfully jailbreak the attacked models but again fail to transfer. Fourth, we construct data-space attacks against VLMs that successfully transfer to new VLMs, and we show that representation space attacks \\emph{can} transfer when VLMs' latent geometries are sufficiently aligned in post-projector space. Our work reveals that adversarial transfer is not an inherent property of all attacks but contingent on their operational domain - the shared data-space versus models' unique representation spaces - a critical insight for building more robust models.",

        "summary": "We introduce Purrception, a variational flow matching approach for vector-quantized image generation that provides explicit categorical supervision while maintaining continuous transport dynamics. Our method adapts Variational Flow Matching to vector-quantized latents by learning categorical posteriors over codebook indices while computing velocity fields in the continuous embedding space. This combines the geometric awareness of continuous methods with the discrete supervision of categorical approaches, enabling uncertainty quantification over plausible codes and temperature-controlled generation. We evaluate Purrception on ImageNet-1k 256x256 generation. Training converges faster than both continuous flow matching and discrete flow matching baselines while achieving competitive FID scores with state-of-the-art models. This demonstrates that Variational Flow Matching can effectively bridge continuous transport and discrete supervision for improved training efficiency in image generation.",

This matching requires researchers to know the exact wording that other researchers previously used, creating a challenging process that could lead to missing relevant data. Large Language Models (LLMs) could enhance data discovery by removing this requirement and allowing researchers to ask questions with natural language. However, we do not currently know if researchers would accept LLMs for data discovery. Using a human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) focus, we ran focus groups (N = 27) to understand researchers' perspectives towards LLMs for data discovery. Our conceptual model shows that the potential benefits are not enough for researchers to use LLMs instead of current technology. Barriers prevent researchers from fully accepting LLMs, but features around transparency could overcome them. Using our model will allow developers to incorporate features that result in an increased acceptance of LLMs for data discovery.",

Building on this methodology, we present RealClass, a dataset that combines a synthesized classroom noise corpus with a classroom speech dataset compiled from publicly available corpora. The speech data pairs a children's speech corpus with instructional speech extracted from YouTube videos to approximate real classroom interactions in clean conditions.

However, its empirical behavior is highly inconsistent: design choices of online-fine tuning that work well in one setting can fail completely in another. We propose a stability--plasticity principle that can explain this inconsistency: we should preserve the knowledge of pretrained policy or offline dataset during online fine-tuning, whichever is better, while maintaining sufficient plasticity. This perspective identifies three regimes of online fine-tuning, each requiring distinct stability properties. We validate this framework through a large-scale empirical study, finding that the results strongly align with its predictions in 45 of 63 cases. This work provides a principled framework for guiding design choices in offline-to-online RL based on the relative performance of the offline dataset and the pretrained policy.",

In contrast, graphical interfaces let users organically discover and invoke possible actions through widgets and menus. To better expose the power of the command line, we demonstrate a mechanism for automatically creating graphical interfaces for command line tools by translating their documentation (in the form of man pages) into interface specifications via AI. Using these specifications, our user-facing system, called GUIde, presents the command options to the user graphically. We evaluate the generated interfaces on a corpus of commands to show to what degree GUIde offers thorough graphical interfaces for users' real-world command line tasks.",

While efficient alternatives to Softmax Attention have been widely studied, the search for more expressive mechanisms grounded in theoretical insight-even at greater computational cost-has been relatively underexplored. In this work, we bridge this gap by proposing Local Linear Attention (LLA), a novel attention mechanism derived from nonparametric statistics through the lens of test-time regression. First, we show that LLA offers theoretical advantages over Linear and Softmax Attention for associative memory via a bias-variance trade-off analysis. Next, we address its computational challenges and propose two memory-efficient primitives to tackle the $\\Theta(n^2 d)$ and $\\Theta(n d^2)$ complexity. We then introduce FlashLLA, a hardware-efficient, blockwise algorithm that enables scalable and parallel computation on modern accelerators. In addition, we implement and profile a customized inference kernel that significantly reduces memory overheads. Finally, we empirically validate the advantages and limitations of LLA on test-time regression, in-context regression, associative recall and state tracking tasks. Experiment results demonstrate that LLA effectively adapts to non-stationarity, outperforming strong baselines in test-time training and in-context learning, and exhibiting promising evidence for its scalability and applicability in large-scale models.

To address this, we propose AFFORD2ACT, an affordance-guided framework that distills a minimal set of semantic 2D keypoints from a text prompt and a single image. AFFORD2ACT follows a three-stage pipeline: affordance filtering, category-level keypoint construction, and transformer-based policy learning with embedded gating to reason about the most relevant keypoints, yielding a compact 38-dimensional state policy that can be trained in 15 minutes, which performs well in real-time without proprioception or dense representations.

The approach first aligns each modality to a shared LLM space through independently trained projections, allowing them to interoperate naturally, and then applies standard instruction tuning with multi-modal data to bring them together for downstream reasoning. By unifying raw biomedical data with knowledge embedded in LLMs, the approach enables zero-shot annotation, cross-modal question answering, and interactive, explainable dialogue. Across tasks spanning cell-type annotation, molecular description, and protein function reasoning, compact BIOVERSE configurations surpass larger LLM baselines while enabling richer, generative outputs than existing BioFMs, establishing a foundation for principled multi-modal biomedical reasoning.",

The study presents an exact expression for the generalization error, leading to a comprehensive classification of benign, tempered, and catastrophic overfitting regimes based on spike strength, the aspect ratio $c=d/n$ (particularly as $c \\to \\infty$), and target alignment. Notably, in well-specified aligned problems, increasing spike strength can surprisingly induce catastrophic overfitting before achieving benign overfitting. The paper also reveals that target-spike alignment is not always advantageous, identifying specific, sometimes counterintuitive, conditions for its benefit or detriment.

        "summary": "Both the general public and academic communities have raised concerns about sycophancy, the phenomenon of artificial intelligence (AI) excessively agreeing with or flattering users. Yet, beyond isolated media reports of severe consequences, like reinforcing delusions, little is known about the extent of sycophancy or how it affects people who use AI. Here we show the pervasiveness and harmful impacts of sycophancy when people seek advice from AI. First, across 11 state-of-the-art AI models, we find that models are highly sycophantic: they affirm users' actions 50% more than humans do, and they do so even in cases where user queries mention manipulation, deception, or other relational harms. Second, in two preregistered experiments (N = 1604), including a live-interaction study where participants discuss a real interpersonal conflict from their life, we find that interaction with sycophantic AI models significantly reduced participants' willingness to take actions to repair interpersonal conflict, while increasing their conviction of being in the right. However, participants rated sycophantic responses as higher quality, trusted the sycophantic AI model more, and were more willing to use it again. This suggests that people are drawn to AI that unquestioningly validate, even as that validation risks eroding their judgment and reducing their inclination toward prosocial behavior. These preferences create perverse incentives both for people to increasingly rely on sycophantic AI models and for AI model training to favor sycophancy. Our findings highlight the necessity of explicitly addressing this incentive structure to mitigate the widespread risks of AI sycophancy.",

Our results show a trade-off: strong labels enable models to capture fine-grained uncertainty dynamics for reliable help detection, while weak labels, though noisier, still support competitive introspection when training and evaluation are aligned, offering a scalable path when dense annotation is impractical. Crucially, we find that modeling the temporal evolution of token-level uncertainty signals with transformers provides far greater predictive power than static sequence-level scores.

Prior evaluations emphasize refusal or harmful-text detection, leaving open whether agents actually compile and run malicious programs. We present JAWS-BENCH (Jailbreaks Across WorkSpaces), a benchmark spanning three escalating workspace regimes that mirror attacker capability: empty (JAWS-0), single-file (JAWS-1), and multi-file (JAWS-M). We pair this with a hierarchical, executable-aware Judge Framework that tests (i) compliance, (ii) attack success, (iii) syntactic correctness, and (iv) runtime executability, moving beyond refusal to measure deployable harm. Using seven LLMs from five families as backends, we find that under prompt-only conditions in JAWS-0, code agents accept 61% of attacks on average; 58% are harmful, 52% parse, and 27% run end-to-end. Moving to single-file regime in JAWS-1 drives compliance to ~ 100% for capable models and yields a mean ASR (Attack Success Rate) ~ 71%; the multi-file regime (JAWS-M) raises mean ASR to ~ 75%, with 32% instantly deployable attack code. Across models, wrapping an LLM in an agent substantially increases vulnerability -- ASR raises by 1.6x -- because initial refusals are frequently overturned during later planning/tool-use steps. Category-level analyses identify which attack classes are most vulnerable and most readily deployable, while others exhibit large execution gaps. These findings motivate execution-aware defenses, code-contextual safety filters, and mechanisms that preserve refusal decisions throughout the agent's multi-step reasoning and tool use.",

This review surveys the methodological landscape of 3D MRI reconstruction, focusing on 4 primary approaches: point cloud, mesh-based, shape-aware, and volumetric models. For each category, we analyze the current state-of-the-art techniques, their methodological foundation, limitations, and applications across anatomical structures. We provide an extensive overview ranging from cardiac to neurological to lung imaging. We also focus on the clinical applicability of models to diseased anatomy, and the influence of their training and testing data. We examine publicly available datasets, computational demands, and evaluation metrics. Finally, we highlight the emerging research directions including multimodal integration and cross-modality frameworks. This review aims to provide researchers with a structured overview of current 3D reconstruction methodologies to identify opportunities for advancing deep learning towards more robust, generalizable, and clinically impactful solutions.",

Just as microsaccades expose subtle but informative shifts in vision, we show that lightweight position encoding perturbations elicit latent signals that indicate model misbehaviour. Our method requires no fine-tuning or task-specific supervision, yet detects failures across diverse settings including factuality, safety, toxicity, and backdoor attacks. Experiments on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that these perturbation-based probes surface misbehaviours while remaining computationally efficient. These findings suggest that pretrained LLMs already encode the internal evidence needed to flag their own failures, and that microsaccade-inspired interventions provide a pathway for detecting and mitigating undesirable behaviours.",

While our prior work has evaluated early-generation AI cell foundation models in this domain, the effectiveness of recent cell foundation models remains unclear. In this study, we benchmark advanced AI cell foundation models (2025), including CellViT++ variants and Cellpose-SAM, against three widely used cell foundation models developed prior to 2024, using a diverse large-scale set of kidney image patches within a human-in-the-loop rating framework. We further performed fusion-based ensemble evaluation and model agreement analysis to assess the segmentation capabilities of the different models. Our results show that CellViT++ [Virchow] yields the highest standalone performance with 40.3% of predictions rated as \"Good\" on a curated set of 2,091 challenging samples, outperforming all prior models. In addition, our fused model achieves 62.2% \"Good\" predictions and only 0.4% \"Bad\", substantially reducing segmentation errors. Notably, the fusion model (2025) successfully resolved the majority of challenging cases that remained unaddressed in our previous study. These findings demonstrate the potential of AI cell foundation model development in renal pathology and provide a curated dataset of challenging samples to support future kidney-specific model refinement.",

Model creation has broadened across countries and organizations and diversified in modality, licensing, and access. Benchmark influence, by contrast, displays centralizing patterns: in the inferred benchmark-author-institution network, the top 15% of nodes account for over 80% of high-betweenness paths, three countries produce 83% of benchmark outputs, and the global Gini for inferred benchmark authority reaches 0.89. An agent-based simulation highlights three mechanisms: higher entry of new benchmarks reduces concentration; rapid inflows can temporarily complicate coordination in evaluation; and stronger penalties against over-fitting have limited effect. Taken together, these results suggest that concentrated benchmark influence functions as coordination infrastructure that supports standardization, comparability, and reproducibility amid rising heterogeneity in model production, while also introducing trade-offs such as path dependence, selective visibility, and diminishing discriminative power as leaderboards saturate.",

We argue that this ambiguity creates substantial liability risk that would deter investment. Fairness transparency is strategically important. We recommend a more tailored regulatory framework to enhance the new EU AI regulation. Further-more, we propose a public system framework to assess the fairness and transparency of AI systems.

While widely applicable, state-of-the-art PU learning methods substantially underperform their supervised counterparts on complex datasets, especially without auxiliary negatives or pre-estimated parameters (e.g., a 14.26% gap on CIFAR-100 dataset). We identify the primary bottleneck as the challenge of learning discriminative representations under unreliable supervision. To tackle this challenge, we propose NcPU, a non-contrastive PU learning framework that requires no auxiliary information. NcPU combines a noisy-pair robust supervised non-contrastive loss (NoiSNCL), which aligns intra-class representations despite unreliable supervision, with a phantom label disambiguation (PLD) scheme that supplies conservative negative supervision via regret-based label updates. Theoretically, NoiSNCL and PLD can iteratively benefit each other from the perspective of the Expectation-Maximization framework. Empirically, extensive experiments demonstrate that: (1) NoiSNCL enables simple PU methods to achieve competitive performance; and (2) NcPU achieves substantial improvements over state-of-the-art PU methods across diverse datasets, including challenging datasets on post-disaster building damage mapping, highlighting its promise for real-world applications.

We propose Budgeted Broadcast (BB), which gives each unit a local traffic budget (the product of its long-term on-rate $a_i$ and fan-out $k_i$). A constrained-entropy analysis shows that maximizing coding entropy under a global traffic budget yields a selectivity-audience balance, $\\log\\frac{1-a_i}{a_i}=\\beta k_i$. BB enforces this balance with simple local actuators that prune either fan-in (to lower activity) or fan-out (to reduce broadcast). In practice, BB increases coding entropy and decorrelation and improves accuracy at matched sparsity across Transformers for ASR, ResNets for face identification, and 3D U-Nets for synapse prediction, sometimes exceeding dense baselines. On electron microscopy images, it attains state-of-the-art F1 and PR-AUC under our evaluation protocol.

This paper presents and evaluates Kant: an efficient unified scheduling platform designed for large-scale AI container clusters, supporting the co-scheduling of both training and inference jobs. Based on the practical implementation of the Kant system, we systematically define a set of key evaluation metrics for AI clusters, including GPU Allocation Ratio (GAR), Scheduling Occupancy Rate (SOR), GPU Node Fragmentation Ratio (GFR), Job Waiting Time Distribution (JWTD), and Job Training Time Estimation Distribution (JTTED), providing a foundation for quantitative performance analysis. Experimental results demonstrate that Kant achieves exceptional performance in clusters ranging from hundreds to tens of thousands of GPUs. By leveraging scheduling strategies such as Backfill and Enhanced Binpack (E-Binpack), the system significantly improves resource utilization and scheduling efficiency, while effectively reducing resource fragmentation and communication overhead in distributed training.

This research proposes a novel framework for improving minute-level prediction accuracy using semantic sentiment scores from top ten different large language models (LLMs) combined with minute interval intraday stock price data. We systematically constructed a time-aligned dataset of AAPL news articles and 1-minute Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock prices for the dates of April 4 to May 2, 2025. The sentiment analysis was achieved using the DeepSeek-V3, GPT variants, LLaMA, Claude, Gemini, Qwen, and Mistral models through their APIs. Each article obtained sentiment scores from all ten LLMs, which were scaled to a [0, 1] range and combined with prices and technical indicators like RSI, ROC, and Bollinger Band Width. Two state-of-the-art such as Reformer and Mamba were trained separately on the dataset using the sentiment scores produced by each LLM as input. Hyper parameters were optimized by means of Optuna and were evaluated through a 3-day evaluation period. Reformer had mean squared error (MSE) or the evaluation metrics, and it should be noted that Mamba performed not only faster but also better than Reformer for every LLM across the 10 LLMs tested. Mamba performed best with LLaMA 3.3--70B, with the lowest error of 0.137. While Reformer could capture broader trends within the data, the model appeared to over smooth sudden changes by the LLMs. This study highlights the potential of integrating LLM-based semantic analysis paired with efficient temporal modeling to enhance real-time financial forecasting.",

The proposed method encodes each bipartitioning step as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem, solved via quantum annealing. This integration of quantum optimization within a hierarchical clustering framework enables handling of graphs with arbitrary correlation structures, including negative edges, without relying on metric assumptions or a predefined number of clusters. Empirical evaluations on synthetic signed graphs and real-world hyperspectral imaging data demonstrate that, when adapted for correlation clustering, GCS-Q outperforms classical algorithms in robustness and clustering quality on real-world data and in scenarios with cluster size imbalance.

Latent reasoning has emerged as an efficient alternative that internalizes the thought process, but it suffers from a critical lack of supervision, limiting its effectiveness on complex, natural-language reasoning traces. In this work, we propose KaVa, the first framework that bridges this gap by distilling knowledge directly from a compressed KV-cache of the teacher into a latent-reasoning student via self-distillation, leveraging the representational flexibility of continuous latent tokens to align stepwise KV trajectories. We show that the abstract, unstructured knowledge within compressed KV-cache, which lacks direct token correspondence, can serve as a rich supervisory signal for a latent reasoning student. Empirically, the approach consistently outperforms strong latent baselines, exhibits markedly smaller degradation from equation-only to natural-language traces, and scales to larger backbones while preserving efficiency. These results establish compressed KV-cache distillation as a scalable supervision signal for latent reasoning, combining the accuracy of CoT-trained teachers with the efficiency and deployability of latent inference.",

        "summary": "Estimating the tangent spaces of a data manifold is a fundamental problem in data analysis. The standard approach, Local Principal Component Analysis (LPCA), struggles in high-noise settings due to a critical trade-off in choosing the neighborhood size. Selecting an optimal size requires prior knowledge of the geometric and noise characteristics of the data that are often unavailable. In this paper, we propose a spectral method, Laplacian Eigenvector Gradient Orthogonalization (LEGO), that utilizes the global structure of the data to guide local tangent space estimation. Instead of relying solely on local neighborhoods, LEGO estimates the tangent space at each data point by orthogonalizing the gradients of low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian. We provide two theoretical justifications of our method. First, a differential geometric analysis on a tubular neighborhood of a manifold shows that gradients of the low-frequency Laplacian eigenfunctions of the tube align closely with the manifold's tangent bundle, while an eigenfunction with high gradient in directions orthogonal to the manifold lie deeper in the spectrum. Second, a random matrix theoretic analysis also demonstrates that low-frequency eigenvectors are robust to sub-Gaussian noise. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that LEGO yields tangent space estimates that are significantly more robust to noise than those from LPCA, resulting in marked improvements in downstream tasks such as manifold learning, boundary detection, and local intrinsic dimension estimation.",

While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generative modeling, most advances rely on continuous Gaussian diffusion. In contrast, discrete diffusion offers a unified framework for jointly modeling categorical data such as text and images. Beyond unification, discrete diffusion provides faster inference, finer control, and principled training-free Bayesian inference, making it particularly well-suited for posterior sampling. However, existing approaches to discrete diffusion posterior sampling face severe challenges: derivative-free guidance yields sparse signals, continuous relaxations limit applicability, and split Gibbs samplers suffer from the curse of dimensionality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Anchored Posterior Sampling (APS) for masked diffusion foundation models, built on two key innovations -- quantized expectation for gradient-like guidance in discrete embedding space, and anchored remasking for adaptive decoding. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance among discrete diffusion samplers across linear and nonlinear inverse problems on the standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate the benefits of our approach in training-free stylization and text-guided editing.",

        "summary": "Traffic forecasting on road networks is a complex task of significant practical importance that has recently attracted considerable attention from the machine learning community, with spatiotemporal graph neural networks (GNNs) becoming the most popular approach. The proper evaluation of traffic forecasting methods requires realistic datasets, but current publicly available benchmarks have significant drawbacks, including the absence of information about road connectivity for road graph construction, limited information about road properties, and a relatively small number of road segments that falls short of real-world applications. Further, current datasets mostly contain information about intercity highways with sparsely located sensors, while city road networks arguably present a more challenging forecasting task due to much denser roads and more complex urban traffic patterns. In this work, we provide a more complete, realistic, and challenging benchmark for traffic forecasting by releasing datasets representing the road networks of two major cities, with the largest containing almost 100,000 road segments (more than a 10-fold increase relative to existing datasets). Our datasets contain rich road features and provide fine-grained data about both traffic volume and traffic speed, allowing for building more holistic traffic forecasting systems. We show that most current implementations of neural spatiotemporal models for traffic forecasting have problems scaling to datasets of our size. To overcome this issue, we propose an alternative approach to neural traffic forecasting that uses a GNN without a dedicated module for temporal sequence processing, thus achieving much better scalability, while also demonstrating stronger forecasting performance. We hope our datasets and modeling insights will serve as a valuable resource for research in traffic forecasting.",

These features undergo multi-scale embedding to simulate the actual RF signal dissemination process. Our evaluation, based on synthetic and real-world measurements, demonstrates that Diffusion^2 accurately estimates the behavior of RF signals in various frequency bands and environmental conditions, with an error margin of just 1.9 dB and 27x faster than existing methods, marking a significant advancement in the field.

GNNs perform message passing on predefined graphs often induced by a fixed radius cutoff or k-nearest neighbor scheme.

In this work, we investigate whether pure, unmodified Transformers trained directly on Cartesian coordinates$\\unicode{x2013}$without predefined graphs or physical priors$\\unicode{x2013}$can approximate molecular energies and forces. As a starting point for our analysis, we demonstrate how to train a Transformer to competitive energy and force mean absolute errors under a matched training compute budget, relative to a state-of-the-art equivariant GNN on the OMol25 dataset. We discover that the Transformer learns physically consistent patterns$\\unicode{x2013}$such as attention weights that decay inversely with interatomic distance$\\unicode{x2013}$and flexibly adapts them across different molecular environments due to the absence of hard-coded biases. The use of a standard Transformer also unlocks predictable improvements with respect to scaling training resources, consistent with empirical scaling laws observed in other domains.

We introduce a non-Euclidean Randomized Progressive Training method-Drop-Muon-a simple yet powerful framework that updates only a subset of layers per step according to a randomized schedule, combining the efficiency of progressive training with layer-specific non-Euclidean updates for top-tier performance. We provide rigorous convergence guarantees under both layer-wise smoothness and layer-wise $(L^0, L^1)$-smoothness, covering deterministic and stochastic gradient settings, marking the first such results for progressive training in the stochastic and non-smooth regime. Our cost analysis further reveals that full-network updates are not optimal unless a very specific relationship between layer smoothness constants holds. Through controlled CNN experiments, we empirically demonstrate that Drop-Muon consistently outperforms full-network Muon, achieving the same accuracy up to $1.4\\times$ faster in wall-clock time. Together, our results suggest a shift in how large-scale models can be efficiently trained, challenging the status quo and offering a highly efficient, theoretically grounded alternative to full-network updates.",

We conduct a comparative investigation on the scaling behavior of Transformers and xLSTM along the following lines, providing insights to guide future model design and deployment. First, we study the scaling behavior for xLSTM in compute-optimal and over-training regimes using both IsoFLOP and parametric fit approaches on a wide range of model sizes (80M-7B) and number of training tokens (2B-2T). Second, we examine the dependence of optimal model sizes on context length, a pivotal aspect that was largely ignored in previous work. Finally, we analyze inference-time scaling characteristics.

Our work addresses this gap by investigating the statistical efficiency of conditional diffusion transformers for imputation and quantifying the uncertainty in missing values. Specifically, we derive statistical sample complexity bounds based on a novel approximation theory for conditional score functions using transformers, and, through this, construct tight confidence regions for missing values. Our findings also reveal that the efficiency and accuracy of imputation are significantly influenced by the missing patterns.

        "summary": "Training large-scale recommendation models under a single global objective implicitly assumes homogeneity across user populations. However, real-world data are composites of heterogeneous cohorts with distinct conditional distributions. As models increase in scale and complexity and as more data is used for training, they become dominated by central distribution patterns, neglecting head and tail regions. This imbalance limits the model's learning ability and can result in inactive attention weights or dead neurons. In this paper, we reveal how the attention mechanism can play a key role in factorization machines for shared embedding selection, and propose to address this challenge by analyzing the substructures in the dataset and exposing those with strong distributional contrast through auxiliary learning. Unlike previous research, which heuristically applies weighted labels or multi-task heads to mitigate such biases, we leverage partially conflicting auxiliary labels to regularize the shared representation. This approach customizes the learning process of attention layers to preserve mutual information with minority cohorts while improving global performance. We evaluated C2AL on massive production datasets with billions of data points each for six SOTA models. Experiments show that the factorization machine is able to capture fine-grained user-ad interactions using the proposed method, achieving up to a 0.16% reduction in normalized entropy overall and delivering gains exceeding 0.30% on targeted minority cohorts.",

While initially developed for Natural Language Processing, these models have demonstrated utility across domains, including Computer Vision. Such models require mechanisms to exchange information along the time dimension, typically using recurrent or self-attention layers. However, self-attention scales quadratically with sequence length, limiting its practicality for very long sequences. We introduce Poolformer, a sequence-to-sequence model that replaces self-attention with recurrent layers and incorporates pooling operations to reduce sequence length. Poolformer is defined recursively using SkipBlocks, which contain residual blocks, a down-pooling layer, a nested SkipBlock, an up-pooling layer, and additional residual blocks. We conduct extensive experiments to support our architectural choices. Our results show that pooling greatly accelerates training, improves perceptual metrics (FID and IS), and prevents overfitting. Our experiments also suggest that long-range dependencies are handled by deep layers, while shallow layers take care of short-term features. Evaluated on raw audio, which naturally features long sequence lengths, Poolformer outperforms state-of-the-art models such as SaShiMi and Mamba.

        "summary": "Generalization in deep learning is closely tied to the pursuit of flat minima in the loss landscape, yet classical Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (SGLD) offers no mechanism to bias its dynamics toward such low-curvature solutions. This work introduces Flatness-Aware Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics (fSGLD), designed to efficiently and provably seek flat minima in high-dimensional nonconvex optimization problems. At each iteration, fSGLD uses the stochastic gradient evaluated at parameters perturbed by isotropic Gaussian noise, commonly referred to as Random Weight Perturbation (RWP), thereby optimizing a randomized-smoothing objective that implicitly captures curvature information. Leveraging these properties, we prove that the invariant measure of fSGLD stays close to a stationary measure concentrated on the global minimizers of a loss function regularized by the Hessian trace whenever the inverse temperature and the scale of random weight perturbation are properly coupled. This result provides a rigorous theoretical explanation for the benefits of random weight perturbation. In particular, we establish non-asymptotic convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance with the best known rate and derive an excess-risk bound for the Hessian-trace regularized objective. Extensive experiments on noisy-label and large-scale vision tasks, in both training-from-scratch and fine-tuning settings, demonstrate that fSGLD achieves superior or comparable generalization and robustness to baseline algorithms while maintaining the computational cost of SGD, about half that of SAM. Hessian-spectrum analysis further confirms that fSGLD converges to significantly flatter minima.",

        "summary": "We study reinforcement learning problems where state observations are stochastically triggered by actions, a constraint common in many real-world applications. This framework is formulated as Action-Triggered Sporadically Traceable Markov Decision Processes (ATST-MDPs), where each action has a specified probability of triggering a state observation. We derive tailored Bellman optimality equations for this framework and introduce the action-sequence learning paradigm in which agents commit to executing a sequence of actions until the next observation arrives. Under the linear MDP assumption, value-functions are shown to admit linear representations in an induced action-sequence feature map. Leveraging this structure, we propose off-policy estimators with statistical error guarantees for such feature maps and introduce ST-LSVI-UCB, a variant of LSVI-UCB adapted for action-triggered settings. ST-LSVI-UCB achieves regret $\\widetilde O(\\sqrt{Kd^3(1-\\gamma)^{-3}})$, where $K$ is the number of episodes, $d$ the feature dimension, and $\\gamma$ the discount factor (per-step episode non-termination probability). Crucially, this work establishes the theoretical foundation for learning with sporadic, action-triggered observations while demonstrating that efficient learning remains feasible under such observation constraints.",

PGG augments the policy gradient with an unconditional branch and interpolates conditional and unconditional branches, yielding a test-time control knob that modulates behavior without retraining. We provide a theoretical derivation showing that the additional normalization term vanishes under advantage estimation, leading to a clean guided policy gradient update. Empirically, we evaluate PGG on discrete and continuous control benchmarks. We find that conditioning dropout-central to diffusion guidance-offers gains in simple discrete tasks and low sample regimes, but dropout destabilizes continuous control. Training with modestly larger guidance ($\\gamma>1$) consistently improves stability, sample efficiency, and controllability. Our results show that guidance, previously confined to diffusion policies, can be adapted to standard on-policy methods, opening new directions for controllable online reinforcement learning.",

Electrocatalysts play a key role in hydrogen energy storage (HES), allowing the energy to be stored as hydrogen. However, the development of affordable and high-performance catalysts for this process remains a significant challenge. We introduce Catalyst GFlowNet, a generative model that leverages machine learning-based predictors of formation and adsorption energy to design crystal surfaces that act as efficient catalysts. We demonstrate the performance of the model through a proof-of-concept application to the hydrogen evolution reaction, a key reaction in HES, for which we successfully identified platinum as the most efficient known catalyst. In future work, we aim to extend this approach to the oxygen evolution reaction, where current optimal catalysts are expensive metal oxides, and open the search space to discover new materials. This generative modeling framework offers a promising pathway for accelerating the search for novel and efficient catalysts.",

Our theory gives simple sufficient conditions for global parameter identifiability: if the mixed graph is bow free and the noise covariance has a uniform eigenvalue margin, then the map from $(\\B,\\OmegaMat)$ to the observational covariance is injective, so both the directed structure and the noise are uniquely determined. The estimator alternates a smooth-acyclic graph update with a convex noise update and can include a light bow complementarity penalty or a post hoc reconciliation step.

Classical confidence-interval cuts such as Clopper-Pearson or Wilson provide lower bounds on recall, but they routinely overshoot the target by several percentage points and exhibit high run-to-run variance under skewed score distributions. We present an end-to-end framework that achieves exact recall with sub-percent variance over tens of millions of geometry pairs, while remaining TPU-friendly. Our pipeline starts with an equigrid bounding-box filter and compressed sparse row (CSR) candidate representation, reducing pair enumeration by two orders of magnitude. A deterministic xxHash bootstrap sample trains a lightweight neural ranker; its scores are propagated to all remaining pairs via a single forward pass and used to construct a reproducible, score-decile-stratified calibration set. Four complementary threshold estimators - Clopper-Pearson, Jeffreys, Wilson, and an exact quantile - are aggregated via inverse-variance weighting, then fused across nine independent subsamples. This ensemble reduces threshold variance compared to any single method. Evaluated on two real cadastral datasets (approximately 6.31M and 67.34M pairs), our approach consistently hits a recall target within a small error, decreases redundant verifications relative to other calibrations, and runs end-to-end on a single TPU v3 core.",

Iran is one of the largest countries with energy resources and in terms of gas is the second-largest country in the world. But, due to the increase in population and energy consumption, it faces problems such as pressure drops and gas outages yearly in cold seasons and therefore it is necessary to control gas consumption, especially in the residential sector, which has the largest share in Iran. This study aims to analyze and predict gas consumption for residential customers in Zanjan province, Iran, using machine learning models, including LSTM, GRU, and a hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model. The dataset consists of gas consumption and meteorology data collected over six years, from 2017 to 2022. The models were trained and evaluated based on their ability to accurately predict consumption patterns. The results indicate that the hybrid BiLSTM-XGBoost model outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy, with lower Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) values, and Mean Percentage Error (MPE). Additionally, the Hybrid model demonstrated robust performance, particularly in scenarios with limited data. The findings suggest that machine learning approaches, particularly hybrid models, can be effectively utilized to manage and predict gas consumption, contributing to more efficient resource management and reducing seasonal shortages. This study highlights the importance of incorporating geographical and climatic factors in predictive modeling, as these significantly influence gas usage across different regions.",

We demonstrate both empirically and theoretically that PENEX implicitly maximizes margins of data points. Also, we show that gradient increments on PENEX implicitly parameterize weak learners in the boosting framework. Across computer vision and language tasks, we show that PENEX exhibits a regularizing effect often better than established methods with similar computational cost.

        "summary": "The weights of neural networks have emerged as a novel data modality, giving rise to the field of weight space learning. A central challenge in this area is that learning meaningful representations of weights typically requires large, carefully constructed collections of trained models, typically referred to as model zoos. These model zoos are often trained ad-hoc, requiring large computational resources, constraining the learned weight space representations in scale and flexibility. In this work, we drop this requirement by training a weight space learning backbone on arbitrary models downloaded from large, unstructured model repositories such as Hugging Face. Unlike curated model zoos, these repositories contain highly heterogeneous models: they vary in architecture and dataset, and are largely undocumented. To address the methodological challenges posed by such heterogeneity, we propose a new weight space backbone designed to handle unstructured model populations. We demonstrate that weight space representations trained on models from Hugging Face achieve strong performance, often outperforming backbones trained on laboratory-generated model zoos. Finally, we show that the diversity of the model weights in our training set allows our weight space model to generalize to unseen data modalities. By demonstrating that high-quality weight space representations can be learned in the wild, we show that curated model zoos are not indispensable, thereby overcoming a strong limitation currently faced by the weight space learning community.",

        "summary": "Flow Matching (FM) algorithm achieves remarkable results in generative tasks especially in robotic manipulation. Building upon the foundations of diffusion models, the simulation-free paradigm of FM enables simple and efficient training, but inherently introduces a train-inference gap. Specifically, we cannot assess the model's output during the training phase. In contrast, other generative models including Variational Autoencoder (VAE), Normalizing Flow and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) directly optimize on the reconstruction loss. Such a gap is particularly evident in scenarios that demand high precision, such as robotic manipulation. Moreover, we show that FM's over-pursuit of straight predefined paths may introduce some serious problems such as stiffness into the system. These motivate us to fine-tune FM via Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions - an approach made feasible by FM's underlying smooth ODE formulation, in contrast to the stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used in diffusion models. This paper first theoretically analyzes the relation between training loss and inference error in FM. Then we propose a method of fine-tuning FM via Maximum Likelihood Estimation of reconstructions, which includes both straightforward fine-tuning and residual-based fine-tuning approaches. Furthermore, through specifically designed architectures, the residual-based fine-tuning can incorporate the contraction property into the model, which is crucial for the model's robustness and interpretability. Experimental results in image generation and robotic manipulation verify that our method reliably improves the inference performance of FM.",

However, DL models often rely on features with unclear physiological meaning, creating a tension between predictive power, clinical interpretability, and sensor design. We address this gap by introducing PPGen, a biophysical model that relates PPG signals to interpretable physiological and optical parameters. Building on PPGen, we propose hybrid amortized inference (HAI), enabling fast, robust, and scalable estimation of relevant physiological parameters from PPG signals while correcting for model misspecification. In extensive in-silico experiments, we show that HAI can accurately infer physiological parameters under diverse noise and sensor conditions. Our results illustrate a path toward PPG models that retain the fidelity needed for DL-based features while supporting clinical interpretation and informed hardware design.",

Evaluated on six canonical posterior families of banana, X-shape, two-moons, rings, a bimodal, and a five-mode mixture, AMF-VI achieves consistently lower negative log-likelihood than each single-flow baseline and delivers stable gains in transport metrics (Wasserstein-2) and maximum mean discrepancy (MDD), indicating improved robustness across shapes and modalities. The procedure is efficient and architecture-agnostic, incurring minimal overhead relative to standard flow training, and demonstrates that adaptive mixtures of diverse flows provide a reliable route to robust VI across diverse posterior families whilst preserving each expert's inductive bias.",

Considering the social impact of AI systems is not merely a technical challenge but a moral imperative. As evidenced in numerous research studies, learning fair and robust representations has proven to be a powerful approach to effectively debiasing algorithms and improving fairness while maintaining essential information for prediction tasks. Representation learning frameworks, particularly those that utilize self-supervised and contrastive learning, have demonstrated superior robustness and generalizability across various domains. Despite the growing interest in applying these approaches to tabular data, the issue of fairness in these learned representations remains underexplored. In this study, we introduce a contrastive learning framework specifically designed to address bias and learn fair representations in tabular datasets. By strategically selecting positive pair samples and employing supervised and self-supervised contrastive learning, we significantly reduce bias compared to existing state-of-the-art contrastive learning models for tabular data.

        "summary": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted growing interest for its crucial ability to uncover irregular patterns in broad applications. Semi-supervised GAD, which assumes a subset of annotated normal nodes available during training, is among the most widely explored application settings. However, the normality learned by existing semi-supervised GAD methods is limited to the labeled normal nodes, often inclining to overfitting the given patterns. These can lead to high detection errors, such as high false positives. To overcome this limitation, we propose GraphNC , a graph normality calibration framework that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to calibrate the normality from a teacher model (a pre-trained semi-supervised GAD model) jointly in anomaly score and node representation spaces. GraphNC includes two main components, anomaly score distribution alignment (ScoreDA) and perturbation-based normality regularization (NormReg). ScoreDA optimizes the anomaly scores of our model by aligning them with the score distribution yielded by the teacher model. Due to accurate scores in most of the normal nodes and part of the anomaly nodes in the teacher model, the score alignment effectively pulls the anomaly scores of the normal and abnormal classes toward the two ends, resulting in more separable anomaly scores. Nevertheless, there are inaccurate scores from the teacher model. To mitigate the misleading by these scores, NormReg is designed to regularize the graph normality in the representation space, making the representations of normal nodes more compact by minimizing a perturbation-guided consistency loss solely on the labeled nodes.",

Generative models provide continuous latent \"maps\" of peptide space, but conventionally ignore decoder-induced geometry and rely on flat Euclidean metrics, rendering exploration and optimization distorted and inefficient. Prior manifold-based remedies assume fixed intrinsic dimensionality, which critically fails in practice for peptide data. Here, we introduce PepCompass, a geometry-aware framework for peptide exploration and optimization. At its core, we define a Union of $\\kappa$-Stable Riemannian Manifolds $\\mathbb{M}^{\\kappa}$, a family of decoder-induced manifolds that captures local geometry while ensuring computational stability. We propose two local exploration methods: Second-Order Riemannian Brownian Efficient Sampling, which provides a convergent second-order approximation to Riemannian Brownian motion, and Mutation Enumeration in Tangent Space, which reinterprets tangent directions as discrete amino-acid substitutions. Combining these yields Local Enumeration Bayesian Optimization (LE-BO), an efficient algorithm for local activity optimization. Finally, we introduce Potential-minimizing Geodesic Search (PoGS), which interpolates between prototype embeddings along property-enriched geodesics, biasing discovery toward seeds, i.e. peptides with favorable activity. In-vitro validation confirms the effectiveness of PepCompass: PoGS yields four novel seeds, and subsequent optimization with LE-BO discovers 25 highly active peptides with broad-spectrum activity, including against resistant bacterial strains. These results demonstrate that geometry-informed exploration provides a powerful new paradigm for antimicrobial peptide design.",

FL is applied in key areas such as healthcare and finance where calibration is strongly required, yet federated private calibration has been largely overlooked. This work introduces the integration of post-hoc model calibration techniques within FL. Specifically, we transfer traditional centralized calibration methods such as histogram binning and temperature scaling into federated environments and define new methods to operate them under strong client heterogeneity. We study (1) a federated setting and (2) a user-level Differential Privacy (DP) setting and demonstrate how both federation and DP impacts calibration accuracy. We propose strategies to mitigate degradation commonly observed under heterogeneity and our findings highlight that our federated temperature scaling works best for DP-FL whereas our weighted binning approach is best when DP is not required.",

        "summary": "The integration of online reinforcement learning (RL) into diffusion and flow models has recently emerged as a promising approach for aligning generative models with human preferences. Stochastic sampling via Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) is employed during the denoising process to generate diverse denoising directions for RL exploration. While existing methods effectively explore potential high-value samples, they suffer from sub-optimal preference alignment due to sparse and narrow reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Granular-GRPO ($\\text{G}^2$RPO ) framework that achieves precise and comprehensive reward assessments of sampling directions in reinforcement learning of flow models. Specifically, a Singular Stochastic Sampling strategy is introduced to support step-wise stochastic exploration while enforcing a high correlation between the reward and the injected noise, thereby facilitating a faithful reward for each SDE perturbation. Concurrently, to eliminate the bias inherent in fixed-granularity denoising, we introduce a Multi-Granularity Advantage Integration module that aggregates advantages computed at multiple diffusion scales, producing a more comprehensive and robust evaluation of the sampling directions. Experiments conducted on various reward models, including both in-domain and out-of-domain evaluations, demonstrate that our $\\text{G}^2$RPO significantly outperforms existing flow-based GRPO baselines,highlighting its effectiveness and robustness.",

        "summary": "Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection identifies abnormal patterns where each timestamp contains multiple variables. Existing MTS anomaly detection methods fall into three categories: reconstruction-based, prediction-based, and classifier-based methods. However, these methods face two key challenges: (1) Unsupervised learning methods, such as reconstruction-based and prediction-based methods, rely on error thresholds, which can lead to inaccuracies; (2) Semi-supervised methods mainly model normal data and often underuse anomaly labels, limiting detection of subtle anomalies;(3) Supervised learning methods, such as classifier-based approaches, often fail to capture local relationships, incur high computational costs, and are constrained by the scarcity of labeled data. To address these limitations, we propose Moon, a supervised modality conversion-based multivariate time series anomaly detection framework. Moon enhances the efficiency and accuracy of anomaly detection while providing detailed anomaly analysis reports. First, Moon introduces a novel multivariate Markov Transition Field (MV-MTF) technique to convert numeric time series data into image representations, capturing relationships across variables and timestamps. Since numeric data retains unique patterns that cannot be fully captured by image conversion alone, Moon employs a Multimodal-CNN to integrate numeric and image data through a feature fusion model with parameter sharing, enhancing training efficiency. Finally, a SHAP-based anomaly explainer identifies key variables contributing to anomalies, improving interpretability. Extensive experiments on six real-world MTS datasets demonstrate that Moon outperforms six state-of-the-art methods by up to 93% in efficiency, 4% in accuracy and, 10.8% in interpretation performance.",

However, it still lags behind full fine-tuning in performance, partly due to its insufficient exploitation of the geometric structure underlying low-rank manifolds. In this paper, we propose a geometry-aware extension of LoRA that uses a three-factor decomposition $U\\!SV^\\top$. Analogous to the structure of singular value decomposition (SVD), it separates the adapter's input and output subspaces, $V$ and $U$, from the scaling factor $S$. Our method constrains $U$ and $V$ to lie on the Stiefel manifold, ensuring their orthonormality throughout the training. To optimize on the Stiefel manifold, we employ a flexible and modular geometric optimization design that converts any Euclidean optimizer to a Riemannian one. It enables efficient subspace learning while remaining compatible with existing fine-tuning pipelines. Empirical results across a wide range of downstream tasks, including commonsense reasoning, math and code generation, image classification, and image generation, demonstrate the superior performance of our approach against the recent state-of-the-art variants of LoRA.

In this paper, we explore the applicability of the TM architecture for large-scale multi-channel (RGB) image classification. We propose a methodology to generate both local interpretations and global class representations. The local interpretations can be used to explain the model predictions while the global class representations aggregate important patterns for each class. These interpretations summarize the knowledge captured by the convolutional clauses, which can be visualized as images. We evaluate our methods on MNIST and CelebA datasets, using models that achieve 98.5\\% accuracy on MNIST and 86.56\\% F1-score on CelebA (compared to 88.07\\% for ResNet50) respectively.

We find that while a small subspace captures most gradient energy, a significant portion still resides in the residual bulk; moreover, the influence of the core subspace diminishes over time and in deeper layers. We also observe that the gradient space exhibits near-flat curvature, calling for algorithms that explicitly account for this geometry.

Compositional solutions, where common elements of computation are flexibly recombined into new configurations, are particularly well-suited for meta-learning. Here, we propose a compositional meta-learning model that explicitly represents tasks as structured combinations of reusable computations. We achieve this by learning a generative model that captures the underlying components and their statistics shared across a family of tasks. This approach transforms learning a new task into a probabilistic inference problem, which allows for finding solutions without parameter updates through highly constrained hypothesis testing. Our model successfully recovers ground truth components and statistics in rule learning and motor learning tasks. We then demonstrate its ability to quickly infer new solutions from just single examples. Together, our framework joins the expressivity of neural networks with the data-efficiency of probabilistic inference to achieve rapid compositional meta-learning.",

In this paper, we propose LieNLSD, which is, to our knowledge, the first method capable of determining the number of infinitesimal generators with nonlinear terms and their explicit expressions. We specify a function library for the infinitesimal group action and aim to solve for its coefficient matrix, proving that its prolongation formula for differential equations, which governs dynamic data, is also linear with respect to the coefficient matrix. By substituting the central differences of the data and the Jacobian matrix of the trained neural network into the infinitesimal criterion, we get a system of linear equations for the coefficient matrix, which can then be solved using SVD. On top quark tagging and a series of dynamic systems, LieNLSD shows qualitative advantages over existing methods and improves the long rollout accuracy of neural PDE solvers by over 20% while applying to guide data augmentation.

Training neural networks with differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DPSGD) influences the model's learning dynamics and, consequently, its output. This can affect the model's performance and fairness. While the majority of studies on the topic report a negative impact on fairness, it has recently been suggested that fairness levels comparable to non-private models can be achieved by optimizing hyperparameters for performance directly on differentially private models (rather than re-using hyperparameters from non-private models, as is common practice). In this work, we analyze the generalizability of this claim by 1) comparing the disparate impact of DPSGD on different performance metrics, and 2) analyzing it over a wide range of hyperparameter settings. We highlight that a disparate impact on one metric does not necessarily imply a disparate impact on another. Most importantly, we show that while optimizing hyperparameters directly on differentially private models does not mitigate the disparate impact of DPSGD reliably, it can still lead to improved utility-fairness trade-offs compared to re-using hyperparameters from non-private models. We stress, however, that any form of hyperparameter tuning entails additional privacy leakage, calling for careful considerations of how to balance privacy, utility and fairness. Finally, we extend our analyses to DPSGD-Global-Adapt, a variant of DPSGD designed to mitigate the disparate impact on accuracy, and conclude that this alternative may not be a robust solution with respect to hyperparameter choice.",

        "summary": "Discrete choice models (DCMs) have long been used to analyze workplace location decisions, but they face challenges in accurately mirroring individual decision-making processes. This paper presents a deep neural network (DNN) method for modeling workplace location choices, which aims to better understand complex decision patterns and provides better results than traditional discrete choice models (DCMs). The study demonstrates that DNNs show significant potential as a robust alternative to DCMs in this domain. While both models effectively replicate the impact of job opportunities on workplace location choices, the DNN outperforms the DCM in certain aspects. However, the DCM better aligns with data when assessing the influence of individual attributes on workplace distance. Notably, DCMs excel at shorter distances, while DNNs perform comparably to both data and DCMs for longer distances. These findings underscore the importance of selecting the appropriate model based on specific application requirements in workplace location choice analysis.",

In particular, we are interested in maximizing the worst-case long-term discounted reward, where the data for RL comes from a nominal model while the deployed environment can deviate from the nominal model within a prescribed uncertainty set. Existing convergence guarantees for robust temporal-difference (TD) learning for policy evaluation are limited to tabular MDPs or are dependent on restrictive discount-factor assumptions when function approximation is used. We present the first robust TD learning with linear function approximation, where robustness is measured with respect to the total-variation distance and Wasserstein-l distance uncertainty set. Additionally, our algorithm is both model-free and does not require generative access to the MDP. Our algorithm combines a two-time-scale stochastic-approximation update with an outer-loop target-network update. We establish an $\\tilde{O}(1/\\epsilon^2)$ sample complexity to obtain an $\\epsilon$-accurate value estimate. Our results close a key gap between the empirical success of robust RL algorithms and the non-asymptotic guarantees enjoyed by their non-robust counterparts. The key ideas in the paper also extend in a relatively straightforward fashion to robust Q-learning with function approximation.",

On DeepSeek-V2-Lite (16B, FP16), BDA requires only 4s of offline preparation with no retraining required and, on modern GPUs, achieves 32% faster key/value projections and 25% smaller weights, while increasing end-to-end perplexity (PPL) by just 0.02% (FP16) or 0.0004% (FP32), a negligible effect on model performance.

Using 151 CAPTURE-24 participants' data, we trained the ActiNet model, a self-supervised, 18-layer, modified ResNet-V2 model, followed by hidden Markov model (HMM) smoothing to classify labels of activity intensity. The performance of this model, evaluated using 5-fold stratified group cross-validation, was then compared to a baseline random forest (RF) + HMM, established in existing literature. Differences in performance and classification outputs were compared with different subgroups of age and sex within the Capture-24 population. The ActiNet model was able to distinguish labels of activity intensity with a mean macro F1 score of 0.82, and mean Cohen's kappa score of 0.86. This exceeded the performance of the RF + HMM, trained and validated on the same dataset, with mean scores of 0.77 and 0.81, respectively. These findings were consistent across subgroups of age and sex.

To address this, we introduce a novel Pessimistic Assortment Optimization (PASTA) framework that leverages the principle of pessimism to achieve optimal expected revenue under general choice models. Notably, PASTA requires only that the offline data distribution contains an optimal assortment, rather than providing the full coverage of all feasible assortments. Theoretically, we establish the first finite-sample regret bounds for offline assortment optimization across several widely used choice models, including the multinomial logit and nested logit models. Additionally, we derive a minimax regret lower bound, proving that PASTA is minimax optimal in terms of sample and model complexity.

In this paper, we introduce support-basis decomposition, a new framework for efficient attention approximation beyond bounded entries. We empirically demonstrate that the entries of the query and key matrices exhibit sub-Gaussian behavior. Our approach uses this property to split large and small entries, enabling exact computation on sparse components and polynomial approximation on dense components. We establish rigorous theoretical guarantees, proving a sub-quadratic runtime, and extend the method to a multi-threshold setting that eliminates all distributional assumptions. Furthermore, we provide the first theoretical justification for the empirical success of polynomial attention [Kacham, Mirrokni, and Zhong, ICML 2024], showing that softmax attention can be closely approximated by a combination of multiple polynomial attentions with sketching.",

In this work, we introduce a new task: detecting post-generation edits locally made to watermarked LLM outputs. To this end, we propose a combinatorial pattern-based watermarking framework, which partitions the vocabulary into disjoint subsets and embeds the watermark by enforcing a deterministic combinatorial pattern over these subsets during generation. We accompany the combinatorial watermark with a global statistic that can be used to detect the watermark. Furthermore, we design lightweight local statistics to flag and localize potential edits. We introduce two task-specific evaluation metrics, Type-I error rate and detection accuracy, and evaluate our method on open-source LLMs across a variety of editing scenarios, demonstrating strong empirical performance in edit localization.",

While recent extensions to hyperbolic and spherical spaces show promise for hierarchical and cyclical patterns, respectively, they require committing to a single geometry a priori, reducing flexibility when data exhibits mixed geometric properties. We introduce the Curvature-Adaptive Transformer (CAT), a novel architecture that dynamically learns per-token routing across three geometric attention branches through a lightweight, differentiable gating mechanism. Unlike fixed-geometry approaches, CAT enables adaptive geometric specialization, routing tokens to the appropriate curvature based on their local relational structure. The routing network provides interpretable curvature preferences while each branch employs geometry-specific operations optimized for its respective manifold. On knowledge graph completion benchmarks (FB15k-237, WN18RR), CAT achieves approximately 10% improvements in MRR and Hits@10 over fixed-geometry baselines with minimal overhead (5% parameter increase, comparable inference time). These results demonstrate that learned geometric adaptation outperforms any single fixed geometry for complex relational reasoning, establishing CAT as a scalable and interpretable foundation for mixture-of-geometry architectures across language, vision, and multimodal domains.",

This critical boundary, separating meaningful latent inference from collapse, is characterized by a discontinuity in the KL divergence between the approximate posterior and the prior distribution. We validate this critical behavior on both synthetic and real-world datasets, confirming the existence of a phase transition. Our results demonstrate that posterior collapse is not merely an optimization failure, but rather an emerging phase transition arising from the interplay between data structure and variational constraints.

We place a spike-and-slab horseshoe prior on the edges and separately learn data-driven weights for scale-free and Erdős-Rényi structures from observational data, treating each edge as a latent variable to enable uncertainty-aware inference. Through extensive simulation, we show that IBCD achieves superior structure recovery compared to existing baselines.

This alignment typically requires fine-tuning, which is computationally demanding. Recently, inference-time alignment via noise optimization has emerged as an efficient alternative, modifying initial input noise to steer the diffusion denoising process towards generating high-reward images. However, this approach suffers from reward hacking, where the model produces images that score highly, yet deviate significantly from the original prompt. We show that noise-space regularization is insufficient and that preventing reward hacking requires an explicit image-space constraint. To this end, we propose MIRA (MItigating Reward hAcking), a training-free, inference-time alignment method. MIRA introduces an image-space, score-based KL surrogate that regularizes the sampling trajectory with a frozen backbone, constraining the output distribution so reward can increase without off-distribution drift (reward hacking). We derive a tractable approximation to KL using diffusion scores. Across SDv1.5 and SDXL, multiple rewards (Aesthetic, HPSv2, PickScore), and public datasets (e.g., Animal-Animal, HPDv2), MIRA achieves >60\\% win rate vs. strong baselines while preserving prompt adherence; mechanism plots show reward gains with near-zero drift, whereas DNO drifts as compute increases.

        "summary": "Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However, existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy (25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems. While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.",

        "summary": "Time series forecasting is central to decision-making in domains as diverse as energy, finance, climate, and public health. In practice, forecasters face thousands of short, noisy series that vary in frequency, quality, and horizon, where the dominant cost lies not in model fitting, but in the labor-intensive preprocessing, validation, and ensembling required to obtain reliable predictions. Prevailing statistical and deep learning models are tailored to specific datasets or domains and generalize poorly. A general, domain-agnostic framework that minimizes human intervention is urgently in demand. In this paper, we introduce TimeSeriesScientist (TSci), the first LLM-driven agentic framework for general time series forecasting. The framework comprises four specialized agents: Curator performs LLM-guided diagnostics augmented by external tools that reason over data statistics to choose targeted preprocessing; Planner narrows the hypothesis space of model choice by leveraging multi-modal diagnostics and self-planning over the input; Forecaster performs model fitting and validation and, based on the results, adaptively selects the best model configuration as well as ensemble strategy to make final predictions; and Reporter synthesizes the whole process into a comprehensive, transparent report. With transparent natural-language rationales and comprehensive reports, TSci transforms the forecasting workflow into a white-box system that is both interpretable and extensible across tasks. Empirical results on eight established benchmarks demonstrate that TSci consistently outperforms both statistical and LLM-based baselines, reducing forecast error by an average of 10.4% and 38.2%, respectively. Moreover, TSci produces a clear and rigorous report that makes the forecasting workflow more transparent and interpretable.",

This is done in a digital twin first, and subsequently in a real-time testbed.

Our method consistently jailbreaks production models while maintaining response quality, even under the highly protected chat interfaces of Google Gemini (2.5 Flash/Pro), DeepSeek Chat (DeepThink), Grok (3), and Mistral Le Chat (Magistral). The attack exploits a resource asymmetry between the prompt guard and the main LLM, encoding a jailbreak prompt that lightweight guards cannot decode but the main model can. This reveals an attack surface inherent to lightweight prompt guards in modern LLM architectures and underscores the need to shift defenses from blocking malicious inputs to preventing malicious outputs. We additionally identify other critical alignment issues, such as copyrighted data extraction, training data extraction, and malicious response leakage during thinking.",

        "summary": "Large Language Models (LLMs) are emerging as versatile foundation models for computational chemistry, handling bidirectional tasks like reaction prediction and retrosynthesis. However, these models often lack round-trip consistency. For instance, a state-of-the-art chemical LLM may successfully caption a molecule, yet be unable to accurately reconstruct the original structure from its own generated text. This inconsistency suggests that models are learning unidirectional memorization rather than flexible mastery. Indeed, recent work has demonstrated a strong correlation between a model's round-trip consistency and its performance on the primary tasks. This strong correlation reframes consistency into a direct target for model improvement. We therefore introduce Round-Trip Reinforcement Learning (RTRL), a novel framework that trains a model to improve its consistency by using the success of a round-trip transformation as a reward signal. We further propose an iterative variant where forward and reverse mappings alternately train each other in a self-improvement loop, a process that is highly data-efficient and notably effective with the massive amount of unlabelled data common in chemistry. Experiments demonstrate that RTRL significantly \\textbf{boosts performance and consistency} over strong baselines across supervised, self-supervised, and synthetic data regimes. This work shows that round-trip consistency is not just a desirable property but a trainable objective, offering a new path toward more robust and reliable foundation models.",

The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$ constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.",

        "summary": "Computational decarbonization aims to reduce carbon emissions in computing and societal systems such as data centers, transportation, and built environments. This requires accurate, fine-grained carbon intensity forecasts, yet existing tools have several key limitations: (i) they require grid-specific electricity mix data, restricting use where such information is unavailable; (ii) they depend on separate grid-specific models that make it challenging to provide global coverage; and (iii) they provide forecasts without uncertainty estimates, limiting reliability for downstream carbon-aware applications. In this paper, we present CarbonX, an open-source tool that leverages Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) for a range of decarbonization tasks. CarbonX utilizes the versatility of TSFMs to provide strong performance across multiple tasks, such as carbon intensity forecasting and imputation, and across diverse grids. Using only historical carbon intensity data and a single general model, our tool achieves a zero-shot forecasting Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 15.82% across 214 grids worldwide. Across 13 benchmark grids, CarbonX performance is comparable with the current state-of-the-art, with an average MAPE of 9.59% and tail forecasting MAPE of 16.54%, while also providing prediction intervals with 95% coverage. CarbonX can provide forecasts for up to 21 days with minimal accuracy degradation. Further, when fully fine-tuned, CarbonX outperforms the statistical baselines by 1.2--3.9X on the imputation task. Overall, these results demonstrate that CarbonX can be used easily on any grid with limited data and still deliver strong performance, making it a practical tool for global-scale decarbonization.",

        "summary": "We study the problem of zero-shot link prediction on knowledge graphs (KGs), which requires models to generalize over novel entities and novel relations. Knowledge graph foundation models (KGFMs) address this task by enforcing equivariance over both nodes and relations, learning from structural properties of nodes and relations, which are then transferable to novel graphs with similar structural properties. However, the conventional notion of deterministic equivariance imposes inherent limits on the expressive power of KGFMs, preventing them from distinguishing structurally similar but semantically distinct relations. To overcome this limitation, we introduce probabilistic node-relation equivariance, which preserves equivariance in distribution while incorporating a principled randomization to break symmetries during inference. Building on this principle, we present Flock, a KGFM that iteratively samples random walks, encodes them into sequences via a recording protocol, embeds them with a sequence model, and aggregates representations of nodes and relations via learned pooling. Crucially, Flock respects probabilistic node-relation equivariance and is a universal approximator for isomorphism-invariant link-level functions over KGs. Empirically, Flock perfectly solves our new diagnostic dataset Petals where current KGFMs fail, and achieves state-of-the-art performances on entity- and relation prediction tasks on 54 KGs from diverse domains.",

For realistic drug dosing, we apply action space design that accommodates discrete, continuous, and directional dosing strategies in a system that combines offline conservative Q-learning with a novel recurrent modeling in a replay buffer to capture temporal dependencies in ICU time-series data. Our comparative analysis of norepinephrine dosing strategies across different action space formulations reveals that the designed action spaces improve interpretability and facilitate clinical adoption while preserving efficacy.

However, these datasets are often contaminated by adversarial poisoning, system errors, or low-quality samples, leading to degraded policy performance in standard behavioral cloning (BC) and offline RL methods. This paper introduces Density-Ratio Weighted Behavioral Cloning (Weighted BC), a robust imitation learning approach that uses a small, verified clean reference set to estimate trajectory-level density ratios via a binary discriminator. These ratios are clipped and used as weights in the BC objective to prioritize clean expert behavior while down-weighting or discarding corrupted data, without requiring knowledge of the contamination mechanism. We establish theoretical guarantees showing convergence to the clean expert policy with finite-sample bounds that are independent of the contamination rate. A comprehensive evaluation framework is established, which incorporates various poisoning protocols (reward, state, transition, and action) on continuous control benchmarks. Experiments demonstrate that Weighted BC maintains near-optimal performance even at high contamination ratios outperforming baselines such as traditional BC, batch-constrained Q-learning (BCQ) and behavior regularized actor-critic (BRAC).",

Traditional supernet-based methods require multiple GPU days per dataset. Large Language Model (LLM)-driven approaches avoid training a large supernet and can provide quick feedback, but we observe an exploration bias: the LLM repeatedly proposes neural network designs within limited search space and fails to discover architectures across different latency ranges in the entire search space. To address this issue, we propose PEL-NAS: a search space Partitioned, architecture prompt co-Evolutionary and LLM-driven Neural Architecture Search that can generate neural networks with high accuracy and low latency with reduced search cost. Our proposed PEL-NAS has three key components: 1) a complexity-driven partitioning engine that divides the search space by complexity to enforce diversity and mitigate exploration bias; 2) an LLM-powered architecture prompt co-evolution operator, in which the LLM first updates a knowledge base of design heuristics based on results from the previous round, then performs a guided evolution algorithm on architectures with prompts that incorporate this knowledge base. Prompts and designs improve together across rounds which avoids random guesswork and improve efficiency; 3) a zero-cost predictor to avoid training a large number of candidates from scratch. Experimental results show that on HW-NAS-Bench, PEL-NAS can achieve overall higher HV, lower IGD, and up to 54% lower latency than baselines at similar accuracy. Meanwhile, the search cost drops from days to minutes compared with traditional supernet baselines.",

Toward finding the global optimum of such black-box optimization problems with sample efficiency, Bayesian optimization (BO) is a theoretically elegant framework that relies on a probabilistic surrogate model so as to iteratively select the query point with well-balanced exploration-exploitation tradeoffs. The Gaussian process (GP), as the de-facto choice for surrogate modeling, has achieved compelling performances for vanilla BO with low-dimensional continuous variables. However, GPs fall short in coping with high-dimensional counterparts with {\\it irregular} variables (e.g., categorical, ordinal, etc.). To alleviate this, neural network-based surrogates have been explored. Inspired by the powerful capabilities of LLMs, we adopt the LLM as the surrogate to model the mapping from the high-dimensional input variables to the objective function. To adapt to the current problem, we leverage the low-rank adaptation (LoRA) to fine-tune the LLM parameters together with the posterior of a linear regression head via the variational Bayesian last layer (VBLL) framework. The resulting LoRA-VBLL is not only computationally light compared to existing alternatives, but also admits recursive updates. To automate the critical selection of the LoRA rank as well as other hyperparameters, a weighted ensemble (ENS) of LoRA-VBLL surrogates has been devised, which further accommodates continual update of the per-model weight and individual LoRA-VBLL parameters via recursive Bayes. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the compelling performance of the proposed (ENS-)LoRA-VBLL approaches on various high-dimensional benchmarks and the real-world molecular optimization tasks.",

Preference optimization, which trains models to distinguish between preferred and non-preferred responses based on human feedback, has become a crucial component for aligning LLMs. However, most existing works assume noise-free feedback, which is unrealistic due to the inherent errors and inconsistencies in human judgments. This paper addresses the impact of noisy feedback on preference optimization, providing generalization guarantees under these conditions. In particular, we consider noise models that correspond to common real-world sources of noise, such as mislabeling and uncertainty. Unlike traditional analyses that assume convergence, our work focuses on finite-step preference optimization, offering new insights that are more aligned with practical LLM training. We describe how generalization decays with different types of noise across levels of noise rates based on the preference data distribution and number of samples. Our analysis for noisy preference learning applies to a broad family of preference optimization losses such as DPO, IPO, SLiC, etc. Empirical validation on contemporary LLMs confirms the practical relevance of our findings, offering valuable insights for developing AI systems that align with human preferences.",

We study when it helps, where it fails, and why, and we show that addressing the resulting failure modes enables policy improvement that was previously unattainable. We focus on Model-Based Policy Optimization (MBPO), which performs actor and critic updates using synthetic action counterfactuals. Despite reports of strong and generalizable sample-efficiency gains in OpenAI Gym, recent work shows that MBPO often underperforms its model-free counterpart, Soft Actor-Critic (SAC), in the DeepMind Control Suite (DMC). Although both suites involve continuous control with proprioceptive robots, this shift leads to sharp performance losses across seven challenging DMC tasks, with MBPO failing in cases where claims of generalization from Gym would imply success. This reveals how environment-specific assumptions can become implicitly encoded into algorithm design when evaluation is limited. We identify two coupled issues behind these failures: scale mismatches between dynamics and reward models that induce critic underestimation and hinder policy improvement during model-policy coevolution, and a poor choice of target representation that inflates model variance and produces error-prone rollouts. Addressing these failure modes enables policy improvement where none was previously possible, allowing MBPO to outperform SAC in five of seven tasks while preserving the strong performance previously reported in OpenAI Gym. Rather than aiming only for incremental average gains, we hope our findings motivate the community to develop taxonomies that tie MDP task- and environment-level structure to algorithmic failure modes, pursue unified solutions where possible, and clarify how benchmark choices ultimately shape the conditions under which algorithms generalize.",

SCOPED is computed from a single diffusion model trained once on a diverse dataset, and combines the Jacobian trace and squared norm of the model's score function into a single test statistic. Rather than thresholding on a fixed value, we estimate the in-distribution density of SCOPED scores using kernel density estimation, enabling a flexible, unsupervised test that, in the simplest case, only requires a single forward pass and one Jacobian-vector product (JVP), made efficient by Hutchinson's trace estimator. On four vision benchmarks, SCOPED achieves competitive or state-of-the-art precision-recall scores despite its low computational cost. The same method generalizes to robotic control tasks with shared state and action spaces, identifying distribution shifts across reward functions and training regimes.

To address this, we introduce SoftAdaClip, a differentially private training method that replaces hard clipping with a smooth, tanh-based transformation to preserve relative gradient magnitudes while bounding sensitivity. We evaluate SoftAdaClip on various datasets, including MIMIC-III (clinical text), GOSSIS-eICU (structured healthcare), and Adult Income (tabular data). Our results show that SoftAdaClip reduces subgroup disparities by up to 87% compared to DP-SGD and up to 48% compared to Adaptive-DPSGD, and these reductions in subgroup disparities are statistically significant.

While contemporary neural compression methods achieve impressive compression rates, the adoption of such technology has been largely hindered by the complexity and large computational costs of the convolution-based decoders during data reconstruction. To address the decoder bottleneck in neural compression, we develop a new compression-reconstruction framework based on incorporating low-rank representation in an autoencoder with vector quantization. We demonstrated that performing a series of computationally efficient low-rank operations on the learned latent representation of images can efficiently reconstruct the data with high quality. Our approach dramatically reduces the computational overhead in the decoding phase of neural compression/reconstruction, essentially eliminating the decoder compute bottleneck while maintaining high fidelity of image outputs.",

While Masked Diffusion Models (MDMs) have emerged as a promising approach for generative modeling in discrete spaces, their capacity for self-correction remains poorly understood. Prior attempts to incorporate self-correction into MDMs either require overhauling MDM architectures/training or rely on imprecise proxies for token quality, limiting their applicability. Motivated by this, we introduce PRISM--Plug-in Remasking for Inference-time Self-correction of Masked Diffusions--a lightweight, model-agnostic approach that applies to any pretrained MDM. Theoretically, PRISM defines a self-correction loss that provably learns per-token quality scores, without RL or a verifier. These quality scores are computed in the same forward pass with MDM and used to detect low-quality tokens. Empirically, PRISM advances MDM inference across domains and scales: Sudoku; unconditional text (170M); and code with LLaDA (8B).",

During training, they learn the score function, which in turn is used to generate samples at inference. They raise a basic yet unsolved question: which score do they actually learn? In principle, a diffusion model that matches the empirical score in the entire data space would simply reproduce the training data, failing to generate novel samples. Recent work addresses this question by arguing that diffusion models underfit the empirical score due to training-time inductive biases. In this work, we refine this perspective, introducing the notion of selective underfitting: instead of underfitting the score everywhere, better diffusion models more accurately approximate the score in certain regions of input space, while underfitting it in others. We characterize these regions and design empirical interventions to validate our perspective. Our results establish that selective underfitting is essential for understanding diffusion models, yielding new, testable insights into their generalization and generative performance.",

This generally requires solution of internal stress tensor, related to the deformation tensor through nonlinear and history-dependent constitutive models. Traditional numerical methods for non-Newtonian fluid dynamics often suffer from prohibitive computational demands and poor scalability to new problem instances. Developments in data-driven methods have mitigated some limitations but still require retraining across varied physical conditions. In this work, we introduce Rheological Operator Transformer (RheOFormer), a generative operator learning method leveraging self-attention to efficiently learn different spatial interactions and features of complex fluid flows. We benchmark RheOFormer across a range of different viscometric and non-viscometric flows with different types of viscoelastic and elastoviscoplastic mechanics in complex domains against ground truth solutions. Our results demonstrate that RheOFormer can accurately learn both scalar and tensorial nonlinear mechanics of different complex fluids and predict the spatio-temporal evolution of their flows, even when trained on limited datasets. Its strong generalization capabilities and computational efficiency establish RheOFormer as a robust neural surrogate for accelerating predictive complex fluid simulations, advancing data-driven experimentation, and enabling real-time process optimization across a wide range of applications.",

These methods can improve generalization and sample efficiency, under the assumption that the transformed datapoints are highly probable, or \"important\", under the test distribution. In this work, we develop a method for critically evaluating this assumption. In particular, we propose a metric to quantify the amount of anisotropy, or symmetry-breaking, in a dataset, via a two-sample neural classifier test that distinguishes between the original dataset and its randomly augmented equivalent. We validate our metric on synthetic datasets, and then use it to uncover surprisingly high degrees of alignment in several benchmark point cloud datasets. We show theoretically that distributional symmetry-breaking can actually prevent invariant methods from performing optimally even when the underlying labels are truly invariant, as we show for invariant ridge regression in the infinite feature limit. Empirically, we find that the implication for symmetry-aware methods is dataset-dependent: equivariant methods still impart benefits on some anisotropic datasets, but not others. Overall, these findings suggest that understanding equivariance -- both when it works, and why -- may require rethinking symmetry biases in the data.",

While recent works attempt to unify SSRL methods by examining their information-theoretic objectives or summarizing their heuristics for preventing representation collapse, architectural elements like the predictor network, stop-gradient operation, and statistical regularizer are often viewed as empirically motivated additions. In this paper, we adopt a first-principles approach and investigate whether the learning objective of an SSRL algorithm dictates its possible optimization strategies and model design choices. In particular, by starting from a variational mutual information (MI) lower bound, we derive two training paradigms, namely Self-Distillation MI (SDMI) and Joint MI (JMI), each imposing distinct structural constraints and covering a set of existing SSRL algorithms. SDMI inherently requires alternating optimization, making stop-gradient operations theoretically essential. In contrast, JMI admits joint optimization through symmetric architectures without such components. Under the proposed formulation, predictor networks in SDMI and statistical regularizers in JMI emerge as tractable surrogates for the MI objective. We show that many existing SSRL methods are specific instances or approximations of these two paradigms. This paper provides a theoretical explanation behind the choices of different architectural components of existing SSRL methods, beyond heuristic conveniences.",

We propose a Quantum-Inspired Intrinsic-dimension Estimation (QuIIEst) benchmark consisting of infinite families of topologically non-trivial manifolds with known ID. Our benchmark stems from a quantum-optical method of embedding arbitrary homogeneous spaces while allowing for curvature modification and additive noise. The IDE methods tested were generally less accurate on QuIIEst manifolds than on existing benchmarks under identical resource allocation. We also observe minimal performance degradation with increasingly non-uniform curvature, underscoring the benchmark's inherent difficulty. As a result of independent interest, we perform IDE on the fractal Hofstadter's butterfly and identify which methods are capable of extracting the effective dimension of a space that is not a manifold.",

        "summary": "Accurate vehicle delay estimation is essential for evaluating the performance of signalized intersections and informing traffic management strategies. Delay reflects congestion levels and affects travel time reliability, fuel use, and emissions. Machine learning (ML) offers a scalable, cost-effective alternative; However, conventional models typically assume that training and testing data follow the same distribution, an assumption that is rarely satisfied in real-world applications. Variations in road geometry, signal timing, and driver behavior across intersections often lead to poor generalization and reduced model accuracy. To address this issue, this study introduces a domain adaptation (DA) framework for estimating vehicle delays across diverse intersections. The framework separates data into source and target domains, extracts key traffic features, and fine-tunes the model using a small, labeled subset from the target domain. A novel DA model, Gradient Boosting with Balanced Weighting (GBBW), reweights source data based on similarity to the target domain, improving adaptability. The framework is tested using data from 57 heterogeneous intersections in Pima County, Arizona. Performance is evaluated against eight state-of-the-art ML regression models and seven instance-based DA methods. Results demonstrate that the GBBW framework provides more accurate and robust delay estimates. This approach supports more reliable traffic signal optimization, congestion management, and performance-based planning. By enhancing model transferability, the framework facilitates broader deployment of machine learning techniques in real-world transportation systems.",

ThinKV is based on the observation that attention sparsity reveals distinct thought types with varying importance within the CoT. It applies a hybrid quantization-eviction strategy, assigning token precision by thought importance and progressively evicting tokens from less critical thoughts as reasoning trajectories evolve. Furthermore, to implement ThinKV, we design a kernel that extends PagedAttention to enable efficient reuse of evicted tokens' memory slots, eliminating compaction overheads. Extensive experiments on DeepSeek-R1-Distill, GPT-OSS, and NVIDIA AceReason across mathematics and coding benchmarks show that ThinKV achieves near-lossless accuracy with less than 5% of the original KV cache, while improving performance with up to 5.8x higher inference throughput over state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "summary": "Structural vibrations induced by external excitations pose significant risks, including safety hazards for occupants, structural damage, and increased maintenance costs. While conventional model-based control strategies, such as Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR), effectively mitigate vibrations, their reliance on accurate system models necessitates tedious system identification. This tedious system identification process can be avoided by using a model-free Reinforcement learning (RL) method. RL controllers derive their policies solely from observed structural behaviour, eliminating the requirement for an explicit structural model. For an RL controller to be truly model-free, its training must occur on the actual physical system rather than in simulation. However, during this training phase, the RL controller lacks prior knowledge and it exerts control force on the structure randomly, which can potentially harm the structure. To mitigate this risk, we propose guiding the RL controller using a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) controller. While LQR control typically relies on an accurate structural model for optimal performance, our observations indicate that even an LQR controller based on an entirely incorrect model outperforms the uncontrolled scenario. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a hybrid control framework that integrates both LQR and RL controllers. In this approach, the LQR policy is derived from a randomly selected model and its parameters. As this LQR policy does not require knowledge of the true or an approximate structural model the overall framework remains model-free. This hybrid approach eliminates dependency on explicit system models while minimizing exploration risks inherent in naive RL implementations. As per our knowledge, this is the first study to address the critical training safety challenge of RL-based vibration control and provide a validated solution.",

        "summary": "Quantum generalizations of the Fisher information are important in quantum information science, with applications in high energy and condensed matter physics and in quantum estimation theory, machine learning, and optimization. One can derive a quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix in a natural way as the Hessian matrix arising in a Taylor expansion of a smooth divergence. Such an approach is appealing for quantum information theorists, given the ubiquity of divergences in quantum information theory. In contrast to the classical case, there is not a unique quantum generalization of the Fisher information matrix, similar to how there is not a unique quantum generalization of the relative entropy or the Rényi relative entropy. In this paper, I derive information matrices arising from the log-Euclidean, $\\alpha$-$z$, and geometric Rényi relative entropies, with the main technical tool for doing so being the method of divided differences for calculating matrix derivatives. Interestingly, for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $\\alpha$, the log-Euclidean Rényi relative entropy leads to the Kubo-Mori information matrix, and the geometric Rényi relative entropy leads to the right-logarithmic derivative Fisher information matrix. Thus, the resulting information matrices obey the data-processing inequality for all non-negative values of the Rényi parameter $\\alpha$ even though the original quantities do not. Additionally, I derive and establish basic properties of $\\alpha$-$z$ information matrices resulting from the $\\alpha$-$z$ Rényi relative entropies. For parameterized thermal states, I establish formulas for their $\\alpha$-$z$ information matrices and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for estimating them, with applications in quantum Boltzmann machine learning.",

Consistency models address this bottleneck by enabling high-quality generation in a single or only a few steps, yet their direct adaptation to inverse problems is underexplored.

Experiments on Fashion-MNIST and LSUN Bedroom datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in perceptual and pixel-level metrics, including Fréchet Inception Distance, Kernel Inception Distance, peak signal-to-noise ratio, and structural similarity index measure, compared to baseline consistency sampling, yielding competitive or superior reconstructions with only a handful of steps.",

We present a hybrid physics-machine learning framework integrating 2.9 million observations from 171,605 locations (2005-2021) combining permafrost fraction data with climate reanalysis. Our stacked ensemble model (Random Forest + Histogram Gradient Boosting + Elastic Net) achieves R2=0.980 (RMSE=5.01 pp) with rigorous spatiotemporal cross-validation preventing data leakage. To address machine learning limitations in extrapolative climate scenarios, we develop a hybrid approach combining learned climate-permafrost relationships (60%) with physical permafrost sensitivity models (40%, -10 pp/C). Under RCP8.5 forcing (+5C over 10 years), we project mean permafrost fraction decline of -20.3 pp (median: -20.0 pp), with 51.5% of Arctic Russia experiencing over 20 percentage point loss. Infrastructure risk classification identifies 15% high-risk zones (25% medium-risk) with spatially explicit uncertainty maps. Our framework represents the largest validated permafrost ML dataset globally, provides the first operational hybrid physics-ML forecasting system for Arctic infrastructure, and delivers open-source tools enabling probabilistic permafrost projections for engineering design codes and climate adaptation planning. The methodology is generalizable to other permafrost regions and demonstrates how hybrid approaches can overcome pure data-driven limitations in climate change applications.",

        "summary": "Recent attempts to transfer features from 2D Vision-Language Models (VLMs) to 3D semantic segmentation expose a persistent trade-off. Directly projecting 2D features into 3D yields noisy and fragmented predictions, whereas enforcing geometric coherence necessitates costly training pipelines and large-scale annotated 3D data. We argue that this limitation stems from the dominant segmentation-and-matching paradigm, which fails to reconcile 2D semantics with 3D geometric structure. The geometric cues are not eliminated during the 2D-to-3D transfer but remain latent within the noisy and view-aggregated features. To exploit this property, we propose GeoPurify that applies a small Student Affinity Network to purify 2D VLM-generated 3D point features using geometric priors distilled from a 3D self-supervised teacher model. During inference, we devise a Geometry-Guided Pooling module to further denoise the point cloud and ensure the semantic and structural consistency. Benefiting from latent geometric information and the learned affinity network, GeoPurify effectively mitigates the trade-off and achieves superior data efficiency. Extensive experiments on major 3D benchmarks demonstrate that GeoPurify achieves or surpasses state-of-the-art performance while utilizing only about 1.5% of the training data.

Prior works have investigated representational alignment between artificial neural networks and the visual cortex. Nevertheless, these findings are indirect and offer limited insights to the structure of neural populations themselves. Similarly, decoding-based methods have quantified semantic features from neural populations but have not uncovered their underlying organizations. This leaves open a scientific question: \"how feature-specific visual information is distributed across neural populations in higher visual areas, and whether it is organized into structured, semantically meaningful subspaces.\" To tackle this problem, we present MIG-Vis, a method that leverages the generative power of diffusion models to visualize and validate the visual-semantic attributes encoded in neural latent subspaces. Our method first uses a variational autoencoder to infer a group-wise disentangled neural latent subspace from neural populations. Subsequently, we propose a mutual information (MI)-guided diffusion synthesis procedure to visualize the specific visual-semantic features encoded by each latent group. We validate MIG-Vis on multi-session neural spiking datasets from the inferior temporal (IT) cortex of two macaques. The synthesized results demonstrate that our method identifies neural latent groups with clear semantic selectivity to diverse visual features, including object pose, inter-category transformations, and intra-class content. These findings provide direct, interpretable evidence of structured semantic representation in the higher visual cortex and advance our understanding of its encoding principles.",

This critically limits their use in interactive applications such as live content creation and emerging generative world models. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task of frame-level online V2A generation, where a model autoregressively generates audio from video without access to future video frames. Furthermore, we propose SoundReactor, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first simple yet effective framework explicitly tailored for this task. Our design enforces end-to-end causality and targets low per-frame latency with audio-visual synchronization. Our model's backbone is a decoder-only causal transformer over continuous audio latents. For vision conditioning, it leverages grid (patch) features extracted from the smallest variant of the DINOv2 vision encoder, which are aggregated into a single token per frame to maintain end-to-end causality and efficiency. The model is trained through a diffusion pre-training followed by consistency fine-tuning to accelerate the diffusion head decoding. On a benchmark of diverse gameplay videos from AAA titles, our model successfully generates semantically and temporally aligned, high-quality full-band stereo audio, validated by both objective and human evaluations. Furthermore, our model achieves low per-frame waveform-level latency (26.3ms with the head NFE=1, 31.5ms with NFE=4) on 30FPS, 480p videos using a single H100.

        "summary": "A central challenge in Bayesian inference is efficiently approximating posterior distributions. Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) is a popular variational inference method which transports a set of particles to approximate a target distribution. The SVGD dynamics are governed by a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and are highly sensitive to the choice of the kernel function, which directly influences both convergence and approximation quality. The commonly used median heuristic offers a simple approach for setting kernel bandwidths but lacks flexibility and often performs poorly, particularly in high-dimensional settings. In this work, we propose an alternative strategy for adaptively choosing kernel parameters over an abstract family of kernels. Recent convergence analyses based on the kernelized Stein discrepancy (KSD) suggest that optimizing the kernel parameters by maximizing the KSD can improve performance. Building on this insight, we introduce Adaptive SVGD (Ad-SVGD), a method that alternates between updating the particles via SVGD and adaptively tuning kernel bandwidths through gradient ascent on the KSD. We provide a simplified theoretical analysis that extends existing results on minimizing the KSD for fixed kernels to our adaptive setting, showing convergence properties for the maximal KSD over our kernel class. Our empirical results further support this intuition: Ad-SVGD consistently outperforms standard heuristics in a variety of tasks.",

        "summary": "Improving statistical forecasts of Atlantic hurricane intensity is limited by complex nonlinear interactions and difficulty in identifying relevant predictors. Conventional methods prioritize correlation or fit, often overlooking confounding variables and limiting generalizability to unseen tropical storms. To address this, we leverage a multidata causal discovery framework with a replicated dataset based on Statistical Hurricane Intensity Prediction Scheme (SHIPS) using ERA5 meteorological reanalysis. We conduct multiple experiments to identify and select predictors causally linked to hurricane intensity changes. We train multiple linear regression models to compare causal feature selection with no selection, correlation, and random forest feature importance across five forecast lead times from 1 to 5 days (24 to 120 hours). Causal feature selection consistently outperforms on unseen test cases, especially for lead times shorter than 3 days. The causal features primarily include vertical shear, mid-tropospheric potential vorticity and surface moisture conditions, which are physically significant yet often underutilized in hurricane intensity predictions. Further, we build an extended predictor set (SHIPS+) by adding selected features to the standard SHIPS predictors. SHIPS+ yields increased short-term predictive skill at lead times of 24, 48, and 72 hours. Adding nonlinearity using multilayer perceptron further extends skill to longer lead times, despite our framework being purely regional and not requiring global forecast data. Operational SHIPS tests confirm that three of the six added causally discovered predictors improve forecasts, with the largest gains at longer lead times. Our results demonstrate that causal discovery improves hurricane intensity prediction and pave the way toward more empirical forecasts.",

We propose a practical two-stage CR extraction framework. In the first stage, the variational probabilistic quantization (VPQ) step is introduced, where Alice and Bob employ probabilistic neural network (NN) encoders to map their observations into discrete, nearly uniform random variables (RVs) with high agreement probability while minimizing information leakage to Eve. This is realized through a variational learning objective combined with adversarial training. In the second stage, a secure sketch using code-offset construction reconciles the encoder outputs into identical secret keys, whose secrecy is guaranteed by the VPQ objective. As a representative application, we study physical layer key (PLK) generation. Beyond the traditional methods, which rely on the channel reciprocity principle and require two-way channel probing, thus suffering from large protocol overhead and being unsuitable in high mobility scenarios, we propose a sensing-based PLK generation method for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems, where paired range-angle (RA) maps measured at Alice and Bob serve as correlated sources. The idea is verified through both end-to-end simulations and real-world software-defined radio (SDR) measurements, including scenarios where Eve has partial knowledge about Bob's position. The results demonstrate the feasibility and convincing performance of both the proposed CR extraction framework and sensing-based PLK generation method.",

The problem is challenging in practical settings where the number of body sensors are limited. Past work has shown promising results using conditional diffusion models, where the pose prediction is conditioned on both <location, rotation> measurements from the sensors. Unfortunately, nearly all these approaches generalize poorly across users, primarly because location measurements are highly influenced by the body size of the user. In this paper, we formulate pose estimation as an inverse problem and design an algorithm capable of zero-shot generalization. Our idea utilizes a pre-trained diffusion model and conditions it on rotational measurements alone; the priors from this model are then guided by a likelihood term, derived from the measured locations. Thus, given any user, our proposed InPose method generatively estimates the highly likely sequence of poses that best explains the sparse on-body measurements.",

The method is based on a neural network architecture that takes as input both material properties in the fluid state (density, yield stress, plastic viscosity) and process parameters (nozzle diameter, nozzle height, printing and flow velocities) to directly predict extruded layer shapes. To enhance generalization, some inputs are reformulated into dimensionless parameters that capture underlying physical principles. Predicted geometries are compactly represented using Fourier descriptors, which enforce smooth, closed, and symmetric profiles while reducing the prediction task to a small set of coefficients. The training dataset was synthetically generated using a well-established Particle Finite Element (PFEM) model of 3DCP, overcoming the scarcity of experimental data. Validation against diverse numerical and experimental cases shows strong agreement, confirming the framework's accuracy and reliability. This opens the way to practical uses ranging from pre-calibration of print settings, minimizing or even eliminating trial-and-error adjustments, to toolpath optimization for more advanced designs. Looking ahead, coupling the framework with simulations and sensor feedback could enable closed-loop digital twins for 3DCP, driving real-time process optimization, defect detection, and adaptive control of printing parameters.",

The dataset spans 147 languages and includes musical style prompts extracted from MusicBrainz and Wikipedia. The dataset is globally balanced, representing musical styles from artists across 79 countries and five continents. Our evaluation reveals large disparities in music quality and alignment with reference music between high-resource and low-resource regions. Furthermore, we find marked differences in model performance between mainstream and geographically niche genres, including cases where models generate music for regional genres that more closely align with the distribution of mainstream styles.",

Our approach expresses PCD as a coupled, multiscale system of stochastic differential equations (SDEs), which perform optimisation of the parameter and sampling of the associated parametrised density, simultaneously. From this novel formulation, we are able to derive explicit bounds for the error between the PCD iterates and the MLE solution for the model parameter. This is made possible by deriving uniform-in-time (UiT) bounds for the difference in moments between the multiscale system and the averaged regime. An efficient implementation of the continuous-time scheme is introduced, leveraging a class of explicit, stable intregators, stochastic orthogonal Runge-Kutta Chebyshev (S-ROCK), for which we provide explicit error estimates in the long-time regime. This leads to a novel method for training energy-based models (EBMs) with explicit error guarantees.",

We model this as a two-player game between an investor and the market, where the investor makes strategic bets on future states while the market reveals outcomes. Inspired by the success of Monte Carlo Tree Search in stochastic games, we introduce an AlphaZero-based system and compare its performance to deep hedging - a widely used industry method based on gradient descent. Through theoretical analysis and experiments, we show that deep hedging struggles in environments where the $Q$-function is not subject to convexity constraints - such as those involving non-convex transaction costs, capital constraints, or regulatory limitations - converging to local optima. We construct specific market environments to highlight these limitations and demonstrate that AlphaZero consistently finds near-optimal replication strategies. On the theoretical side, we establish a connection between deep hedging and convex optimization, suggesting that its effectiveness is contingent on convexity assumptions. Our experiments further suggest that AlphaZero is more sample-efficient - an important advantage in data-scarce, overfitting-prone derivative markets.",

        "summary": "Ranking items is a central task in many information retrieval and recommender systems. User input for the ranking task often comes in the form of ratings on a coarse discrete scale. We ask whether it is possible to recover a fine-grained item ranking from such coarse-grained ratings. We model items as having scores and users as having thresholds; a user rates an item positively if the item's score exceeds the user's threshold. Although all users agree on the total item order, estimating that order is challenging when both the scores and the thresholds are latent. Under our model, any ranking method naturally partitions the $n$ items into bins; the bins are ordered, but the items inside each bin are still unordered. Users arrive sequentially, and every new user can be queried to refine the current ranking. We prove that achieving a near-perfect ranking, measured by Spearman distance, requires $\\Theta(n^2)$ users (and therefore $\\Omega(n^2)$ queries). This is significantly worse than the $O(n\\log n)$ queries needed to rank from comparisons; the gap reflects the additional queries needed to identify the users who have the appropriate thresholds. Our bound also quantifies the impact of a mismatch between score and threshold distributions via a quadratic divergence factor. To show the tightness of our results, we provide a ranking algorithm whose query complexity matches our bound up to a logarithmic factor. Our work reveals a tension in online ranking: diversity in thresholds is necessary to merge coarse ratings from many users into a fine-grained ranking, but this diversity has a cost if the thresholds are a priori unknown.",

This paper leverages microscaling floating-point formats, a novel technique designed to address these challenges by reducing the storage and computational overhead associated with numerical representations in LLMs. Unlike traditional floating-point representations that allocate a dedicated scale for each value, microscaling employs a shared scale across a block of values, enabling compact one-byte floating-point representations while maintaining an extended dynamic range. We explore the application of microscaling in the context of 8-bit floating-point formats to significantly reduce memory footprint and computational costs. We tested several configurations of microscaling floats within the GPT-2 LLM architecture, demonstrating that microscaling data formats can achieve competitive accuracy during training and inference, proving its efficacy as a resource-efficient alternative for deploying LLMs at scale.

In particular, reproducible code is rarely available. The aim of this paper is to provide a reproducible comparative study of all existing categorical kernels on many of the test cases investigated so far. We also propose new evaluation metrics inspired by the optimization community, which provide quantitative rankings of the methods across several tasks. From our results on datasets which exhibit a group structure on the levels of categorical inputs, it appears that nested kernels methods clearly outperform all competitors. When the group structure is unknown or when there is no prior knowledge of such a structure, we propose a new clustering-based strategy using target encodings of categorical variables. We show that on a large panel of datasets, which do not necessarily have a known group structure, this estimation strategy still outperforms other approaches while maintaining low computational cost.",

Federated modeling offers a practical solution that preserves data privacy while enabling global modeling across distributed data sources. For instance, environmental sensor networks are privacy- and bandwidth-constrained, motivating federated spatial modeling that shares only privacy-preserving summaries to produce timely, high-resolution pollution maps without centralizing raw data. However, existing federated modeling approaches either ignore spatial dependence or rely on synchronous updates that suffer from stragglers in heterogeneous environments. This work proposes an asynchronous federated modeling framework for spatial data based on low-rank Gaussian process approximations. The method employs block-wise optimization and introduces strategies for gradient correction, adaptive aggregation, and stabilized updates. We establish linear convergence with explicit dependence on staleness, a result of standalone theoretical significance. Moreover, numerical experiments demonstrate that the asynchronous algorithm achieves synchronous performance under balanced resource allocation and significantly outperforms it in heterogeneous settings, showcasing superior robustness and scalability.",

In particular, RS-CL aligns the representations more closely with the robot's proprioceptive states, by using relative distances between the states as soft supervision. Complementing the original action prediction objective, RS-CL effectively enhances control-relevant representation learning, while being lightweight and fully compatible with standard VLA training pipeline. Our empirical results demonstrate that RS-CL substantially improves the manipulation performance of state-of-the-art VLA models; it pushes the prior art from 30.8% to 41.5% on pick-and-place tasks in RoboCasa-Kitchen, through more accurate positioning during grasping and placing, and boosts success rates from 45.0% to 58.3% on challenging real-robot manipulation tasks.",

The malware detection pipeline in use by Gmail contains a machine learning model that routes each potential malware sample to a specialized malware classifier to improve accuracy and performance. This model, called Magika, has been open sourced. By designing adversarial examples that fool Magika, we can cause the production malware service to incorrectly route malware to an unsuitable malware detector thereby increasing our chance of evading detection. Specifically, by changing just 13 bytes of a malware sample, we can successfully evade Magika in 90% of cases and thereby allow us to send malware files over Gmail. We then turn our attention to defenses, and develop an approach to mitigate the severity of these types of attacks. For our defended production model, a highly resourced adversary requires 50 bytes to achieve just a 20% attack success rate. We implement this defense, and, thanks to a collaboration with Google engineers, it has already been deployed in production for the Gmail classifier.",

Early diagnosis is crucial for reducing mortality; however, challenges persist due to limited oral health programs, inadequate infrastructure, and a shortage of healthcare practitioners. Conventional deep learning models, while promising, often rely on point estimates, leading to overconfidence and reduced reliability. Critically, these models require large datasets to mitigate overfitting and ensure generalizability, an unrealistic demand in settings with limited training data. To address these issues, we propose a hybrid model that combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with Bayesian deep learning for oral cancer classification using small training sets. This approach employs variational inference to enhance reliability through uncertainty quantification. The model was trained on photographic color images captured by smartphones and evaluated on three distinct test datasets. The proposed method achieved 94% accuracy on a test dataset with a distribution similar to that of the training data, comparable to traditional CNN performance. Notably, for real-world photographic image data, despite limitations and variations differing from the training dataset, the proposed model demonstrated superior generalizability, achieving 88% accuracy on diverse datasets compared to 72.94% for traditional CNNs, even with a smaller dataset. Confidence analysis revealed that the model exhibits low uncertainty (high confidence) for correctly classified samples and high uncertainty (low confidence) for misclassified samples. These results underscore the effectiveness of Bayesian inference in data-scarce environments in enhancing early oral cancer diagnosis by improving model reliability and generalizability.",

        "summary": "Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) extend the success of language models to visual understanding, and recent efforts have sought to build unified MLLMs that support both understanding and generation. However, constructing such models remains challenging: hybrid approaches combine continuous embeddings with diffusion or flow-based objectives, producing high-quality images but breaking the autoregressive paradigm, while pure autoregressive approaches unify text and image prediction over discrete visual tokens but often face trade-offs between semantic alignment and pixel-level fidelity. In this work, we present Bridge, a pure autoregressive unified MLLM that augments pre-trained visual understanding models with generative ability through a Mixture-of-Transformers architecture, enabling both image understanding and generation within a single next-token prediction framework. To further improve visual generation fidelity, we propose a semantic-to-pixel discrete representation that integrates compact semantic tokens with fine-grained pixel tokens, achieving strong language alignment and precise description of visual details with only a 7.9% increase in sequence length. Extensive experiments across diverse multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that Bridge achieves competitive or superior results in both understanding and generation benchmarks, while requiring less training data and reduced training time compared to prior unified MLLMs.",

        "summary": "Humans intuitively perceive complex social signals in visual scenes, yet it remains unclear whether state-of-the-art AI models encode the same similarity structure. We study (Q1) whether modern video and language models capture human-perceived similarity in social videos, and (Q2) how to instill this structure into models using human behavioral data. To address this, we introduce a new benchmark of over 49,000 odd-one-out similarity judgments on 250 three-second video clips of social interactions, and discover a modality gap: despite the task being visual, caption-based language embeddings align better with human similarity than any pretrained video model. We close this gap by fine-tuning a TimeSformer video model on these human judgments with our novel hybrid triplet-RSA objective using low-rank adaptation (LoRA), aligning pairwise distances to human similarity. This fine-tuning protocol yields significantly improved alignment with human perceptions on held-out videos in terms of both explained variance and odd-one-out triplet accuracy. Variance partitioning shows that the fine-tuned video model increases shared variance with language embeddings and explains additional unique variance not captured by the language model. Finally, we test transfer via linear probes and find that human-similarity fine-tuning strengthens the encoding of social-affective attributes (intimacy, valence, dominance, communication) relative to the pretrained baseline. Overall, our findings highlight a gap in pretrained video models' social recognition and demonstrate that behavior-guided fine-tuning shapes video representations toward human social perception.",

        "summary": "Advanced control strategies like Model Predictive Control (MPC) offer significant energy savings for HVAC systems but often require substantial engineering effort, limiting scalability. Reinforcement Learning (RL) promises greater automation and adaptability, yet its practical application in real-world residential settings remains largely undemonstrated, facing challenges related to safety, interpretability, and sample efficiency. To investigate these practical issues, we performed a direct comparison of an MPC and a model-based RL controller, with each controller deployed for a one-month period in an occupied house with a heat pump system in West Lafayette, Indiana. This investigation aimed to explore scalability of the chosen RL and MPC implementations while ensuring safety and comparability. The advanced controllers were evaluated against each other and against the existing controller. RL achieved substantial energy savings (22\\% relative to the existing controller), slightly exceeding MPC's savings (20\\%), albeit with modestly higher occupant discomfort. However, when energy savings were normalized for the level of comfort provided, MPC demonstrated superior performance. This study's empirical results show that while RL reduces engineering overhead, it introduces practical trade-offs in model accuracy and operational robustness. The key lessons learned concern the difficulties of safe controller initialization, navigating the mismatch between control actions and their practical implementation, and maintaining the integrity of online learning in a live environment. These insights pinpoint the essential research directions needed to advance RL from a promising concept to a truly scalable HVAC control solution.",

        "summary": "Data-efficient learning aims to eliminate redundancy in large training datasets by training models on smaller subsets of the most informative examples. While data selection has been extensively explored for vision models and large language models (LLMs), it remains underexplored for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Notably, none of existing methods can outperform random selection at different subset sizes. In this work, we propose the first principled method for data-efficient instruction tuning of LVLMs. We prove that examples with similar cross-modal attention matrices during instruction tuning have similar gradients. Thus, they influence model parameters in a similar manner and convey the same information to the model during training. Building on this insight, we propose XMAS, which clusters examples based on the trajectories of the top singular values of their attention matrices obtained from fine-tuning a small proxy LVLM. By sampling a balanced subset from these clusters, XMAS effectively removes redundancy in large-scale LVLM training data. Extensive experiments show that XMAS can discard 50% of the LLaVA-665k dataset and 85% of the Vision-Flan dataset while fully preserving performance of LLaVA-1.5-7B on 10 downstream benchmarks and speeding up its training by 1.2x. This is 30% more data reduction compared to the best baseline for LLaVA-665k. The project's website can be found at https://bigml-cs-ucla.github.io/XMAS-project-page/.",

We conduct laboratory-style experiments using large language models to replicate classic studies on herd behavior in trading decisions. Our results show that AI agents make more rational decisions than humans, relying predominantly on private information over market trends. Increased reliance on AI-powered trading advice could therefore potentially lead to fewer asset price bubbles arising from animal spirits that trade by following the herd. However, exploring variations in the experimental settings reveals that AI agents can be induced to herd optimally when explicitly guided to make profit-maximizing decisions. While optimal herding improves market discipline, this behavior still carries potential implications for financial stability. In other experimental variations, we show that AI agents are not purely algorithmic, but have inherited some elements of human conditioning and bias.",

        "summary": "In a multi-follower Bayesian Stackelberg game, a leader plays a mixed strategy over $L$ actions to which $n\\ge 1$ followers, each having one of $K$ possible private types, best respond. The leader's optimal strategy depends on the distribution of the followers' private types. We study an online learning version of this problem: a leader interacts for $T$ rounds with $n$ followers with types sampled from an unknown distribution every round. The leader's goal is to minimize regret, defined as the difference between the cumulative utility of the optimal strategy and that of the actually chosen strategies. We design learning algorithms for the leader under different feedback settings. Under type feedback, where the leader observes the followers' types after each round, we design algorithms that achieve $\\mathcal O\\big(\\sqrt{\\min\\{L\\log(nKA T), nK \\} \\cdot T} \\big)$ regret for independent type distributions and $\\mathcal O\\big(\\sqrt{\\min\\{L\\log(nKA T), K^n \\} \\cdot T} \\big)$ regret for general type distributions. Interestingly, those bounds do not grow with $n$ at a polynomial rate. Under action feedback, where the leader only observes the followers' actions, we design algorithms with $\\mathcal O( \\min\\{\\sqrt{ n^L K^L A^{2L} L T \\log T}, K^n\\sqrt{ T } \\log T \\} )$ regret.

This creates an 'information void' where semantic information that could be inferred from unmasked tokens is lost between denoising steps. We introduce Continuously Augmented Discrete Diffusion (CADD), a framework that augments the discrete state space with a paired diffusion in a continuous latent space. This yields graded, gradually corrupted states in which masked tokens are represented by noisy yet informative latent vectors rather than collapsed 'information voids'. At each reverse step, CADD may leverage the continuous latent as a semantic hint to guide discrete denoising. The design is clean and compatible with existing discrete diffusion training. At sampling time, the strength and choice of estimator for the continuous latent vector enables a controlled trade-off between mode-coverage (generating diverse outputs) and mode-seeking (generating contextually precise outputs) behaviors. Empirically, we demonstrate CADD improves generative quality over mask-based diffusion across text generation, image synthesis, and code modeling, with consistent gains on both qualitative and quantitative metrics against strong discrete baselines.",

Accurately forecasting malaria outbreaks is essential for effective resource allocation and timely interventions. This study proposes a hybrid predictive modeling framework that combines time-series forecasting, multi-output regression, and conventional regression-based prediction to forecast the incidence of malaria. Environmental variables, past malaria case data, and demographic information from Amhara Region health centers were used to train and validate the models. The multi-output regression approach enables the simultaneous prediction of multiple outcomes, including Plasmodium species-specific cases, temporal trends, and spatial variations, whereas the hybrid framework captures both seasonal patterns and correlations among predictors. The proposed model exhibits higher prediction accuracy than single-method approaches, exposing hidden patterns and providing valuable information to public health authorities.

Specifically, for any concept class $\\mathcal{C}$ and error parameter $\\alpha$, a private realizable learner for $\\mathcal{C}$ can be transformed into a private agnostic learner while only increasing the sample complexity by $\\widetilde{O}(\\mathrm{VC}(\\mathcal{C})/\\alpha^2)$, which is essentially tight assuming a constant privacy parameter $\\varepsilon = \\Theta(1)$. However, when $\\varepsilon$ can be arbitrary, one has to apply the standard privacy-amplification-by-subsampling technique (Kasiviswanathan et al., 2011), resulting in a suboptimal extra sample complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(\\mathrm{VC}(\\mathcal{C})/\\alpha^2\\varepsilon)$ that involves a $1/\\varepsilon$ factor. In this work, we give an improved construction that eliminates the dependence on $\\varepsilon$, thereby achieving a near-optimal extra sample complexity of $\\widetilde{O}(\\mathrm{VC}(\\mathcal{C})/\\alpha^2)$ for any $\\varepsilon\\le 1$. Moreover, our result reveals that in private agnostic learning, the privacy cost is only significant for the realizable part.
